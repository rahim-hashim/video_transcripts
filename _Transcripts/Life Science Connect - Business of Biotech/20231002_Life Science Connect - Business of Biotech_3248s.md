Video Description: Don't be offended by the title of today's Business of Biotech podcast. Dr. Quin Wills' application of what's become known as "Wheaton's Law" (look it up) is central to the ambitious goals his company, Ochre Bio, is pursuing: pioneering the value of computational biology in large mol discovery and development, putting an end to the global liver disease epidemic, and changing the costly, high-risk approach to clinical trials. On this week's episode, Dr. Wills and I explore how those goals are being addressed despite the challenges they present, and how the company's three guiding principles, don't be a dick being one of them, align the Ochre team with the mission at hand.

# Don't Be A D**k With Ochre Bio's Dr. Quin Wills
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [October 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q)
*  The business of biotech is produced by LifeScience Connect and its community of learning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=0.0s)]
*  solving, and sourcing resources for biopharma decision makers. If you're working on biologics [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=5.2s)]
*  process development and manufacturing challenges, you need to swing by bioprocessonline.com. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=11.44s)]
*  If you're trying to stay ahead of the cell or gene therapy curve, visit cellandgene.com. When it's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=17.12s)]
*  time to map out your clinical course, let clinicalleader.com help. And if optimizing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=22.72s)]
*  outsourcing decisions is what you're after, check out outsourcepharma.com. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=28.4s)]
*  We're LifeScience Connect, and we're here to help. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  If necessity is the mother of invention, as they say, dissatisfaction is perhaps the mother of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=40.0s)]
*  innovation. When he co-founded OkreBio in 2019, Dr. Quinn Will's dissatisfaction ran deep and it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  ran wide. Quinn earned his M.D. at Witwatersrand, a master's in computational biology at Cambridge, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=55.12s)]
*  and both a master's in applied and computational mathematics and a PhD in statistical genomics at [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=62.4s)]
*  Oxford. In parallel with his PhD, he founded a pharmacogenomics company, then completed his [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=68.08s)]
*  postdoc at the Mayo Clinic. Then he was a single cell genomics career development fellow at Oxford [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=74.72s)]
*  before joining Novo Nordisk as head of cellular and systems genomics at its research center in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=82.88s)]
*  Oxford. Those collective experiences pulled back the curtain on the sources of Dr. Will's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=88.88s)]
*  dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction with our industry's surface level applications of computational [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=95.92s)]
*  biology, our archaic translational models, and the expensive and high-risk approach to clinical [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=102.72s)]
*  trials. So in 2019, Quinn launched OkreBio with the intention of challenging these paradigms and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=109.92s)]
*  as if those big swings weren't enough, the company's focus is on one of the biggest swings a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=117.6s)]
*  new biopharma can take on, liver diseases, which affect billions of people globally. I'm Matt [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=123.2s)]
*  Piller. This is the Business Biotech and on today's show we're going one-on-one with the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=130.4s)]
*  brilliant and brazen Dr. Quinn Wills. Quinn, welcome to the show. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=134.64s)]
*  Oh, thank you very much for having me. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=139.27999999999997s)]
*  It's my pleasure. So I gave the sensational highlights in my setup of the conversation, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=142.32s)]
*  but that's where I want to start. I want to start by digging into some of the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  details around your thought process and what inspired you when you decided to launch Okre. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=152.48s)]
*  And really kind of get into some of the detail around those three challenges that you sought to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=159.68s)]
*  address. So let's start with your general motivation. I outlined your background, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=164.96s)]
*  but what was sort of the general motivating factor in saying, okay, I'm going to go [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=172.0s)]
*  co-found this OkreBio, a biopharmaceutical company. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think the easiest way to think about it is in that trajectory, which you painted very nicely. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=179.52s)]
*  Feeling very good about my life right now. There's a love story and a love-hate story. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=186.32s)]
*  For me, the love story has always been liver disease. Even when I trained clinically and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=192.48s)]
*  did my genetics degree in South Africa, I was very focused on alcoholism. And that's what got [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  me thinking a lot around alcoholic liver disease. It's a huge issue in South Africa because of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  structures and poverty driving really troublesome drinking patterns in South Africa. And so that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=211.04s)]
*  really got me in, ultimately got me into the liver space. And I've kept pulling the liver [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=222.16s)]
*  space all the way through. As you mentioned, started a liver pharmacogenomics company [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=226.8s)]
*  about 17 years ago. And even when I sort of set up the advanced genomics department for Nova Nordisk, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=232.0s)]
*  was very focused on liver and this epidemic that we're seeing now in chronic liver disease. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=238.16s)]
*  So that's been the love story. I think the love-hate story has been data. Like a lot of geneticists, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=244.56s)]
*  sort of in the turn of the millennium, I was wowed by the Human Genome Project and really [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=252.8s)]
*  wanted to get into this game. I began to, I don't want to say began to drink the Kool-Aid, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=259.12s)]
*  because that sounds a bit disrespectful, but really began to drink the Kool-Aid of big data [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=264.32s)]
*  and big biological digitalization and how that's going to change everything. And that sort of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=269.2s)]
*  triggered then me getting into more computers and maths and eventually sort of machine learning and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=274.32s)]
*  statistical learning approaches in sort of big genomic data sets. And I reached a point, I think, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=280.48s)]
*  particularly with my position at Nova, and this is not finger pointing to anything in particular in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=287.84s)]
*  Nova, but started reflecting on where I'm seeing the impact in big data. If we're doing all this [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=293.6s)]
*  big discovery, only human discovery, I should say, only to have to validate in animal models, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  and then still not really have an easy way to do clinical trials. Liver trials, particularly, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=314.0s)]
*  talking about certain elements of liver trials, for example, if you think about scarring, cirrhosis, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=320.88s)]
*  this is easily $100 million, that sort of trial. And these are very high risk, very long, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=327.12s)]
*  very expensive trials. And so the thinking there was right, well, this is not going to, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=333.44s)]
*  I'm not going to solve this within a pharma setting. Could we do this on our own? And that's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  really the beginnings of Okubio to be a company that really takes on those three hurdles. The [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=347.28s)]
*  whole value chain in many ways is focused on generating vast quantities of very actionable, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=352.55999999999995s)]
*  rich data, the kind of data that quite nicely complements modern genetics. And we can speak [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  to a little bit of that if you'd like. Also then focus on a validation pipeline that's not overly [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=366.55999999999995s)]
*  reliant on animal models. Animal models, the average mouse lives two years. It takes probably [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=374.08s)]
*  20 years for the average person to develop cirrhosis. The applicability of short-lived [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  mammalian models to long-lived humans is sketchy at best. And then once we have that, think about [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=384.88s)]
*  how to do trials that we can take on as a small company that de-risk the biology before we invest [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  in even bigger trials. And that's us in a nutshell. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=398.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And they're all related. Is it a chron- and I want to, we'll dig into each of those, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=401.52s)]
*  I guess, three big hurdles in a minute. But is there a chronology to the approach or is it sort of, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=409.12s)]
*  do addressing these three things happen in parallel? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=416.64s)]
*  There's a hell of a lot of building the jumbo while it's taking off. You start to get biotech. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  But there has been a certain chronology to it. When the seed funding in our company helped us [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=426.32s)]
*  set up some of the early discovery, our series A funding really helped now drive a lot of the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=433.12s)]
*  validation pipeline and setting up labs in Taiwan and New York to really flesh that out properly. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=439.04s)]
*  And now as we look towards series B next year, that'll be about going to clinic. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=446.24s)]
*  Yeah. All right. So I want to, let's start with the computational part. I want to dig a little [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=451.6s)]
*  bit deeper into that. Tell me, is liver disease a great place to exercise some big data computational [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=455.92s)]
*  tool chops because it's so prevalent and the numbers are so vast in terms of the patient [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=466.0s)]
*  population or not? Like why was it time in liver disease to say, you know what, we can [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=471.76s)]
*  build and apply and leverage some computational tools that will make a difference. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=480.88s)]
*  So I think the original motivation has been my passion for liver disease and the incredible [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  prevalence of what's going on. Well, so before you go any further with that, you mentioned that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  your passion for liver disease, I just want to ask you a sort of follow-up on that. You said [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=496.24s)]
*  that arose during your time in South Africa because it was affecting the society generally there? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  So then it was all about alcoholism and thinking about some of the genetics around [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=509.92s)]
*  fetal alcohol syndrome and metabolism in mothers and sort of what could be driving patients at risk [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=515.28s)]
*  for developing fetal alcohol syndrome, for example. And that's sort of gone me into the whole thinking [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=522.0s)]
*  about the incredible nature versus nurture dynamic that happens in liver and liver disease [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=527.2s)]
*  and how that plays into the story ultimately of how we react to different drugs. So liver [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=533.36s)]
*  tox with different drugs, which is a big limiting factor, which triggered my first company. And now [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=539.2s)]
*  this big epidemic that we're seeing with fatty liver disease, which is basically we're all getting [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=544.72s)]
*  older. We're a lot more sedentary than our grandparents used to be. And we're all a little [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=549.2s)]
*  bit more heavy set than our grandparents used to be. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So back to the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=554.0s)]
*  question about the application of computational in that population. So for us, whatever we take on [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=559.84s)]
*  in liver, it has to take those three boxes. We have to be able to see where we can generate [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=567.2s)]
*  a large amount of data that gives us an unfair advantage. We have to be able to see the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=573.44s)]
*  tractable and very translatable models that we can develop in the space to really interrogate the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=578.72s)]
*  biology. And then we have to be able to see the kind of trials we want to do. And thankfully, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=585.12s)]
*  liver allows for a lot of that. Yeah. The data generation space, you're right. There's a lot of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=590.72s)]
*  it going on and it didn't take, I don't want to say it didn't take too much effort. It took a lot [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=596.8s)]
*  of effort, but we could get up and going very quickly with the type of biobank sample that we [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  needed to really understand the natural range of disease in the population out there. The other [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=607.12s)]
*  thing that's really nifty from a research point of view about liver disease is that it's very [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=613.52s)]
*  visual. You can see a lot in histology. So it gave us a very nice connection between doing [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  the kind of single cell and spatial, the very deep, high resolution genomics that we like to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=625.44s)]
*  do to map genes to cells. We can then in the same data map that to histology. And then as one would [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=631.2s)]
*  traditionally do map histology to blood and clinical trace. So it really allowed us this very visual [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  nature of liver disease and the histology behind us gave us a lovely hook connecting stuff that's [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=644.48s)]
*  happening at a cellular level to what we see happening in patients. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=649.44s)]
*  In order to apply computational tools to the data that would be so readily available should [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=654.96s)]
*  you develop a means of collecting it and sorting it out and making sense of it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=662.4000000000001s)]
*  But you've got to have some chops there. So tell me about where you, I mean, obviously I kind of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=666.6400000000001s)]
*  rattled off your academic CV there. So you've got some computational science and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=671.7600000000001s)]
*  mathematics experience from school. What along the journey has transpired both in your mind and in [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=678.4s)]
*  the tech world that have enabled the collection and application of this data? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=687.52s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question. I think medicine helped me recognize what are the good questions [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  to ask. I think my data computational sort of machine learning training helped me ask [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=706.48s)]
*  good questions in a good way, if that makes sense. And one of the biggest learnings I feel I've had [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=715.68s)]
*  in my sort of industry career has been that in the big data space, I think there are a lot of [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=722.24s)]
*  very talented scientists spending far too much time obsessed about big data for big data's sake. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=729.12s)]
*  New technologies to map even more at even a higher resolution, at half the price. And [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  one of the things that I've had to learn very early on in my career is that this is fantastic [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=743.28s)]
*  and it's great and we should be doing those things, but you have to focus on actionable data. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  If doing all this discovery doesn't help you make a clear decision as to what you want to take [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=754.0s)]
*  forward into validation and doing the kind of experiments you run a validation, those don't [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  help you make clear decisions about what you want to take forward to clinical trial. What are you [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=763.68s)]
*  doing? Yeah. You founded the company 2019. From 2019, just follow on to that sort of the application [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=767.8399999999999s)]
*  of computational tools in biotech. From 2019 to now, so it's end of summer 2023, what's changed [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=780.0799999999999s)]
*  in terms of like investor appetite and potentially partner appetite and even the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=788.88s)]
*  computational tool landscape in those few years since you started the company? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=794.48s)]
*  I think the obvious answer to that is enthusiasm for AI, right? Yeah. In the space at the moment. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=802.8s)]
*  The way I like to explain it is if web browsers help the average person to understand what the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=808.56s)]
*  internet is. When the first web browser came out, the average Joe was, ah, this is the internet. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=818.08s)]
*  Generative AI and the chat GPT phenomena of the world has helped us understand how important AI [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=825.44s)]
*  can be to really augment what we do. That's triggered a lot of enthusiasm in the space [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=832.48s)]
*  and arguably a bit of a hype cycle. For us, it always boils down to, so of course we love it, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=837.2s)]
*  we're AI at heart in everything we do. Again, it's always got to tick boxes for us. When we use AI [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=845.2s)]
*  and when we use the evolving AI that we have used from 2019 to 2023, it has to take three boxes for [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=852.72s)]
*  us. Does it allow us to do something better than what we've already done? It doesn't matter how [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=859.9200000000001s)]
*  sexy it is. If it's not better than, is it really worth the effort? Does it make something cheaper [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=865.5200000000001s)]
*  or does it make it faster? When it ticks at least two of those three boxes, we become interested. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=871.68s)]
*  I had a conversation with a friend of mine, Andrew Sats, recently from Evolva. I'm not sure if you're [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=878.88s)]
*  filming with Andrew, but he tossed out on me the quote. I think this is a play on an old cliche, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=884.8s)]
*  but he said in biotech right now, AI is akin to sex in high school. He's like everybody who says [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=893.76s)]
*  they're doing it isn't really doing it and the people who really are doing it aren't talking [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=905.84s)]
*  about it. I will take that. I like that very much. I think it's funny and it's probably true to some [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=910.4s)]
*  degree. I know that Okra is the people. You're the guy who's doing it but not talking about it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=918.56s)]
*  It's true. It's because you realize, I think it's one of those things where [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=927.3599999999999s)]
*  the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know. The same truth applies to [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=931.5999999999999s)]
*  a lot of AI techniques. So yes, when I get asked, are we using generative AI? Because that is the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=937.28s)]
*  big question. Yes, we are using generative AI. We love it for our imaging pipelines. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=943.6s)]
*  We use a form of it called self-supervised neural networks where the algorithm can learn without [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=951.52s)]
*  human supervision. That's an incredibly powerful approach. That's the good story. We are [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=958.16s)]
*  really utilizing it. That's the good side of the story. The downside is, the reality is when it [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=965.44s)]
*  comes to interpreting what we call human interpretable features, what a histopathologist [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=970.96s)]
*  will look at, that's fat buildup, that's this, that, it still struggles to outperform the more [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=976.88s)]
*  traditional machine learning approaches like segmentation approaches to pull out those features. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=982.32s)]
*  Yeah. All right. We'll probably touch back on computational shortly but I want to move on to [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=988.1600000000001s)]
*  the translation models. Challenge number two that Ocker set out to tackle. So, the two-year [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=995.44s)]
*  lifespan versus the 20-year progression of liver disease. The point kind of speaks for itself but [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1005.44s)]
*  also why not mice? Also, why not mice and what are the alternatives that Ocker is exploring? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1013.12s)]
*  Yeah. Sure. So, perhaps one thing, one sort of point of clarification on that is that [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1023.6s)]
*  I'll walk you through the type of models we develop but all of the human models we do, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1030.32s)]
*  we only run them for about five days, sometimes two weeks, some of the models. So, these are very [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1034.72s)]
*  shorter models and we like to think quite good shorter models but if you're developing long-acting [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1042.16s)]
*  therapies which we're doing with the type of sRNAs we're doing, the regulator is always, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1048.8s)]
*  and rightly so, is always going to want to understand long-term safety, long-term effects [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1053.9199999999998s)]
*  and for that, there really is at the moment no way of getting around going to animal models. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1060.32s)]
*  What we're saying as a company and as a team is that relying on animal models for internal [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1065.68s)]
*  conviction, that action that you need to take, I spoke about actionable data, relying on animal [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1071.9199999999998s)]
*  models solely to help you make that decision is a bad idea, particularly with chronic disease and [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1077.84s)]
*  I don't think many would disagree with that. I suppose the devil in the detail then is how [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1084.08s)]
*  exactly do you do this? And well, I think we'll shout once we get very good results, hopefully, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1089.36s)]
*  coming out of the clinical trials but for us, that's meant setting up three biology teams. So, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1096.24s)]
*  we have a biology team in Oxford that looks like a traditional validation team but only works in [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1102.32s)]
*  primary human cells. So, basically working with the components of the liver that they mix together to [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1108.96s)]
*  build up parts of the liver, to really tease apart the basic biology of what's going on and that [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1113.76s)]
*  approach is fantastic because it gives you that flexibility but of course is the most removed from [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1119.28s)]
*  true physiology or pathophysiology of what's going on in the liver. So, we have that team. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1125.76s)]
*  We also then have our team in Taipei, which is the only team in the world that is able to take, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1131.76s)]
*  and by that I mean routinely take at scale biopsies of diseased livers and turn each one of those [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1137.28s)]
*  biopsies into about 50 slices and then we culture these slices almost like little mini livers, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1144.24s)]
*  micro livers and these are now disease that are coming from patients with disease where we can [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1148.72s)]
*  now perturb them, image them, single cell sequence them to find out what's going on. That has less [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1153.68s)]
*  flexibility than what the team in Oxford do but now we're getting one step closer to really what's [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1160.8000000000002s)]
*  going on in the liver. The other biology team, the New York team, takes discarded donor livers, human [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1166.8000000000002s)]
*  donor livers. We put them on machines. We've optimized how to keep these livers alive for five [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1174.16s)]
*  days and then we test out our final therapies in these livers to see what we can shift the needle on [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1179.28s)]
*  over five days. None of these are perfect. Even a human liver on a machine is not a whole human [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1185.92s)]
*  liver. What we are saying is that this helps us fail faster and we can really see what's not going [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1191.92s)]
*  to work in a human being much more so than if we were just doing mouse models. Yeah. You preface [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1198.16s)]
*  that commentary with the regulatory demand requirement. What is the regulatory reaction [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1207.04s)]
*  if you've seen one yet to these approaches? Yeah, the two things that maybe you'll listen [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1216.24s)]
*  that I need to be aware of is that one is that the regulator is going to want what the regulator [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1223.52s)]
*  wants and you have to abide by that and there are good reasons for why you have to abide by that [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1229.84s)]
*  and we will abide by that. The interesting change that has happened and the effects are not going [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1236.64s)]
*  to be immediate is that the FDA, we've had the FDA Modernization Act in the US last year, which now [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1241.8400000000001s)]
*  means animal testing is not required to go to clinics. For the first time in history, you can [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1249.3600000000001s)]
*  really take a therapy all the way through to market to patient using human-only data. There's [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1256.16s)]
*  a really exciting journey now to be had around what kind of models can we use to replace animal [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1262.16s)]
*  models and if you think a little bit further down the line, what really excites me about [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1269.68s)]
*  this change in regulation is that we could also start thinking about [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1275.3600000000001s)]
*  perfusion studies, for example, as running the clinical trial before you run the clinical trial. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1280.48s)]
*  So it helps you do things like trial design. You can select your patient population that's going [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1285.52s)]
*  to work for your therapeutic before you go on to the big trial. So it's a very exciting space. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1290.88s)]
*  There's a long journey to be had here, but it's really grand to see that the FDA has spearheaded [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1296.5600000000002s)]
*  this and other regulators are following quickly. Yeah. Do you consider, as it relates to that [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1302.96s)]
*  Modernization Act and the industry's acceptance of it, embrace of it, do you consider OCR sort of [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1310.0800000000002s)]
*  pioneering in that regard, like pushing forward with its ideas of what modernization might look [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1318.88s)]
*  like in that paradigm? Absolutely. So that's the game for us ultimately is how can we, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1324.5600000000002s)]
*  irrespective of what we take on, how can we maximize the use of human data? I often, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1332.0800000000002s)]
*  when I'm giving this type of talk to an audience, I often frame a lot of what we're discussing is [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1339.1200000000001s)]
*  how to use humans as the model. That's the question. Moving away from, so we have genetics now, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1343.84s)]
*  but how do we really use the human as a model at a scientific level and at the regulatory level? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1350.0s)]
*  What's that journey for us? Right. Okay. Well, you made a nice segue into the third hurdle, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1355.44s)]
*  clinical trials. And clinical trials, if I were to ask the open-ended question, well, what's the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1362.48s)]
*  problem with current clinical trials? I feel like that would be unfair to you because it would be a [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1368.8799999999999s)]
*  long, long answer. Unfair to our audience because we need to dedicate several shows to it. But you [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1373.68s)]
*  made a nice segue there as you were talking about the app, sort of the building application of your [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1380.96s)]
*  ideas towards improving clinical trials. So let's drill in there a little bit. The difficulty, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1387.76s)]
*  the expense, the high risk of clinical trials, what makes you think that a startup company like [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1394.48s)]
*  Oker, just around since 2019, can have an impact on that historical paradigm? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1399.76s)]
*  I wouldn't be quite as bold as to say that we're the ones who are going to break how everything [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1407.6s)]
*  works. There are lots of very open doors that we're already pushing on. For example, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1412.0s)]
*  platform trials, we're finally there. People are embracing platform trials, which is fantastic. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1418.8s)]
*  And the kind of therapy that we develop, the modality we use, SIRNA, I think plays very [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1425.2s)]
*  nicely into the concept of platform trials and the type of design we could ultimately do. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1430.48s)]
*  I think for us, perhaps something that is not obvious to those who don't know the liver space [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1436.5600000000002s)]
*  is that if one in, let's talk about, let's focus on sort of Western countries. Depending on where [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1444.64s)]
*  you are, it's going to be one in four to one in three people now with fatty liver disease. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1452.48s)]
*  Right? So again, you're older, you're slightly obese, you hate jogging. So now you have a fatty [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1456.24s)]
*  liver. So that's one in four and one in three of us. That is what's driving a lot of what we [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1463.68s)]
*  see now in the big jump in cirrhosis and the need for liver transplants, et cetera. The flip [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1469.52s)]
*  side of that is that because so many of us have chronic liver disease, so many of us make [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1476.0s)]
*  for very poor liver donors. And so the demand is going up, but the supply is coming down in the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1482.16s)]
*  transplant space because really at the end of the day, the only definitive therapy when your liver [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1488.3200000000002s)]
*  fails is a transplant. And so for us as a company, part of thinking about how we can de-risk this [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1492.48s)]
*  problem is first focusing on the supply. So we can take donor livers, put them on these machines, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1498.0800000000002s)]
*  treat them with our therapy outside of the body. So very de-risked, then transplant. So we're [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1504.88s)]
*  tackling the same biology, but very focused on improving outcomes or improving utilization [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1510.56s)]
*  of these poor livers. And then once we de-risk that in what is a much shorter, much more tractable [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1516.24s)]
*  trial, that will give us sort of the big thumbs up to go, right, let's now switch over to the [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1524.0s)]
*  other side. Let's focus on the demand and patients living with chronic disease and invest in those [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1529.76s)]
*  bigger trials. We know that early stage biopharmers need support. Producing and scaling a biologic [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1536.24s)]
*  molecule is not easy. Companies with new or evolving programs need assistance every step [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1544.0s)]
*  of the way. Join us each week as we discuss all things emerging biotech, including regulatory, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1549.28s)]

*  emerging biotech. That's C-Y-T-I-V-A.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1572.8s)]
*  You admitted to me when we last spoke that these ideas, these big ideas, these big swings [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1582.4s)]
*  and challenges to sort of the status quo, I think you used the word stacking risk. You recognize [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1589.76s)]
*  that your company is stacking risk. You've got a lot of complex intellectual property and we'll [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1596.24s)]
*  dig into that, your liver biopsy approach here in a minute too. But so the question is, and I asked [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1602.0s)]
*  you sort of what the investor appetite is for computational. What has been the investor appetite [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1610.8s)]
*  for Ochre? I mean, you guys are doing some things that, you know, there's a segment of the investment [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1615.68s)]
*  community that is comfortable laying money down in tried and true fields. And then it's a special [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1622.96s)]
*  segment that is going to look at a company like Ochre and be like, yeah, I mean, I like that bold [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1631.28s)]
*  approach and I'm going to bet on it. So just give me some color on that. Like what's the investment [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1637.04s)]
*  strategy look like and how's the concept being received? With cheers and booze at the same time. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1641.76s)]
*  When you say booze, you're just playing that B-O-O-S not B-O-O-Z-E. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1650.64s)]
*  Well, possibly all three. I don't know. We create the market and we resolve the market. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1656.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's been a very, very difficult setup. You know, of course people love the vision, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1664.1599999999999s)]
*  but at the end of the day you have to deliver. And I think for us it comes back to that [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1672.72s)]
*  comment you made about stacking risk. And again, I will shout loudly once we have that first successful [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1677.52s)]
*  clinical trial, but here's how we think about the problem at the moment. We are taking a lot of [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1684.3999999999999s)]
*  different types of risks. There's a lot of discovery risk, a lot of validation risk. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1691.12s)]
*  There's a lot of clinical trial risk and there's a lot of chemistry risk. You know, we have a huge [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1695.1999999999998s)]
*  oligotherapeutics lab in Oxford that's making, innovating in the space for us. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1699.6799999999998s)]
*  So how do we balance all of that? And it is a stacking risk problem. And whenever we take [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1705.6s)]
*  on a particular question or a particular biology that we want to think about, we try very hard not [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1712.0s)]
*  to stack too much risk. So I'll give you an example. Last year, I feel one of the biggest [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1718.48s)]
*  breakthroughs our chemistry team had was figuring out how to very specifically target cancer cells [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1725.92s)]
*  in the liver, which was incredible. In the siRNA space, it's all about delivery. Well, there's a [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1733.2s)]
*  lot more to be had beyond that, but delivery is a very big issue right now. How do you get that siRNA [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1739.28s)]
*  to the right cells? And we hit on this idea and it worked. Fantastic. Cancer really wasn't one [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1745.12s)]
*  of our core themes. We're more, you know, chronic liver disease is about metabolic dysfunction, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1753.84s)]
*  chronic inflammation, fibrosis, scarring cirrhosis. And then at the end, cancer, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1760.4799999999998s)]
*  you know, a lot of primary liver cancers happen in patients with cirrhosis. So we know it's there, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1766.6399999999999s)]
*  but we haven't been thinking too much around it. But thankfully, we have a lot of ideas around [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1771.92s)]
*  cancer because of thinking about how to help cell survive. So instead of trying to bolt on [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1776.8000000000002s)]
*  the chemistry risk to one of our big discovery programs, we said, listen, this really opens [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1783.28s)]
*  up something where we can, because it's so specific to cancer cells, let's just find some [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1788.48s)]
*  targets we know would work really well in terms of blating the cells. And did that. And it worked [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1793.2s)]
*  beautifully in the sense of we can very specifically get to cancer cells. We can, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1800.0s)]
*  you know, and if it's not that specific, we see, you know, we see the safety effects happening. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1806.56s)]
*  But as you increase the specificity, you get the effect that you want. And we've done that [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1811.84s)]
*  as something slightly separate from our other pipelines that we're pushing through targets so [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1817.12s)]
*  that we're not sharing the risk across that. And so that is just, that's just one example of how [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1821.84s)]
*  I think we as a company like to think about very, I don't want to say we're not stacking [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1826.96s)]
*  risk because clearly we are, but how we are very carefully stacking the risk towards the clinic. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1831.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. What do activities like that, exercises like that do in terms of your [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1836.24s)]
*  indication strategy? You know, because I mean, I was going to ask you to sort of [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1843.92s)]
*  color a little bit, color in a little bit on what the patient and market opportunity looks like [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1849.76s)]
*  in liver disease in the near term. Obviously there are several indications that you could pursue. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1855.92s)]
*  And I know that, or at least I think Ochre is still sort of sussing out like what its candidate [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1862.0800000000002s)]
*  and indication pipeline might look like. But what, so I guess, yeah, let me use a lot of words to [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1867.92s)]
*  ask a simple question. How is your, how is your, how is your indication strategy shaping up [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1874.88s)]
*  at this point? Is it too early to say? No, no, no. I think it's a very good question. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1882.0s)]
*  So when we started off as a company, we had a few North Star ideas. I do believe that it's very [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1889.44s)]
*  useful for biotechs to have a clear idea of focus as to where do we want to go with that? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1897.12s)]
*  Otherwise we become, I know our phenotype very well. We become very distracted very easily with [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1902.64s)]
*  all our poise and all the lovely things we can do. So we did start the company with a very clear [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1908.08s)]
*  idea saying, right, we're first going to focus on metabolic and cellular resilience issues. So when [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1913.1999999999998s)]
*  I say cellular resilience, I basically mean how to stop cells from dying, as happens in the transplant [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1920.96s)]
*  space, in the cirrhosis, et cetera. And so, and we use that and the kind of indications we want to [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1926.6399999999999s)]
*  take on as our initial guide. You know, so for example, in the transplant setting, in [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1932.8s)]
*  decondensating patients with, with liver cirrhosis, et cetera. And we use that as an initial guide. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1938.24s)]
*  As we matured a little bit as a company, we brought in a head of translation who has been [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1944.48s)]
*  doing a lot of work with us in terms of scoping out basically how we strategize our entire portfolio [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1949.92s)]
*  beyond just these lovely Northstar ideas. And I think for us, what this has boiled down to is, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1958.0s)]
*  even though funding markets can be a bit weary of cancer right now, we do see cancer is a really [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1965.8400000000001s)]
*  interesting opportunity where we can make a big dent in the space. We really do like liver [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1973.28s)]
*  transplant trials. And it's a wide open space. Big Pharma doesn't want to touch transplants. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1981.44s)]
*  It's really fantastic for a company like ourselves. And we can now see what kind of systemic trials [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1986.8s)]
*  we would like to take on. And there really is so much in the space right now. So much that people [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1994.08s)]
*  are not even perhaps aware of. I know it's popular to think that viral hepatitis is largely a solved [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=1998.8s)]
*  problem. It's not. There are a lot of people even on therapy who are still struggling with chronic [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2006.48s)]
*  viral hepatitis and are at high risk for eventually developing cirrhosis and cancer [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2013.12s)]
*  because there's this constant death of hepatocytes in the cells happening. So these are all things [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2018.08s)]
*  we believe we'll be able to shift the needle on, that we will be able to do trials on, and are going [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2024.1599999999999s)]
*  to be pushing forward for our series B funding. Yeah. Very exciting. You alluded to, you know, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2031.04s)]
*  we sort of been sprinkling some process conversation in here. And you alluded to [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2037.1999999999998s)]
*  the biopsy exercise, the biopsy initiative. I want to learn more about that. Like you have [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2042.64s)]
*  this novel approach to liver biopsies to enable your preclinical studies. Give us more on that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2049.28s)]
*  Where are they coming from? What are you looking for? What are you doing with them? And how is it [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2056.08s)]
*  informing your go-forward plan? Yeah. So let me generalize that question again back to the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2060.08s)]
*  the AI question. For us, because the biopsy question really relates to how we think about AI [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2067.2s)]
*  in many ways. So AI for us has to be better, cheaper, faster. I'll give you examples of each [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2072.7999999999997s)]
*  past. So for us, better is, you know, a lot of AI techniques are fantastic at picking out [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2078.3999999999996s)]
*  highly nonlinear relationships and very complex data sets that traditional mathematics or [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2087.9199999999996s)]
*  statistical approaches and human experts on the other just can't do. So it's really great [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2093.44s)]
*  for that. And we use that both with our genomic data and our imaging data. So that's one big [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2099.28s)]
*  application for us. We also use AI to make things cheaper. So one thesis we have as a company, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2105.44s)]
*  and again, we'll see how it all pans out once we go to clinic. But one thesis we have as a company [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2116.32s)]
*  is that we don't want to be doing big screens and oversimplistic models. So there are a lot of [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2120.96s)]
*  computational biology companies out there that are banking on the idea that they set up huge [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2132.16s)]
*  factories of essentially robots running very, very simple cell-based models, imaging, sequencing, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2136.96s)]
*  perturbing every gene. So really brute force approaches. Now, those are fantastic. And I'm [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2143.92s)]
*  sure we're going to see some wonderful successes coming out of those. I really have to question [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2148.48s)]
*  how valid those approaches are for chronic diseases and chronic liver disease in our case, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2155.28s)]
*  where you really need complex models, the complex human models. So we want the complex human models, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2160.32s)]
*  and they are extensive, but we also want to achieve scale. We want that kind of scale. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2166.56s)]
*  And so for us, that's where AI comes in. And one of the ideas that we're having really great [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2170.72s)]
*  success on right now is how do we start running a screen in more complex models, train the AI, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2176.08s)]
*  AI learns from the data, and then starts making predictions. And then we test those predictions. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2185.36s)]
*  So rather than just doing a big brute force, we're quickly, it's almost like rapid prototyping. We're [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2190.7999999999997s)]
*  very just quickly trying out ideas to much more quickly converge on the biology of interest. So [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2196.48s)]
*  that is a, you know, in effect makes what we do a lot cheaper. So we love it for that. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2201.92s)]
*  The biopsy imaging story started off as a fast notion, and then thankfully started [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2208.48s)]
*  ticking a lot of other boxes for us. You know, we, as I suggested, we process a lot of imaging data. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2213.92s)]
*  You know, the first big discovery project was spatially sequencing a thousand human livers, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2221.12s)]
*  imaging each liver multiple times, you know, from H&E to trichome stains to PAS. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2227.6000000000004s)]
*  And then of course, wanting to analyze these images. That is beyond the realm of a traditional [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2233.04s)]
*  histopathologist. That's a lot of data to look at. And so for us, having algorithms to really speed [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2240.4s)]
*  that up was quite important. And we spent a lot of time and effort as a team, developing tools [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2246.5600000000004s)]
*  internally, playing with other vendor tools, really trying to get a head around what works. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2252.88s)]
*  What we have also found with imaging as a space is it's had other advantages. It doesn't just speed [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2257.36s)]
*  things up using AI approaches. It also helps standardize. You know, the average histopathologist [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2263.92s)]
*  cannot agree with him or herself from morning to afternoon. And that's very problematic in the [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  liver space when a lot of clinical trial endpoints are basically biopsy endpoints. So having that [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2275.76s)]
*  standardization rate. The third big lesson we're learning out of this is that these AI approaches [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2283.1200000000003s)]
*  are really good at spotting things that humans can't see. And so what we think about is latent [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2289.6800000000003s)]
*  features in our data. The things that humans will go, oh, that's obviously fat buildup. That's a [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2297.1200000000003s)]
*  clump of inflammatory cells. But the algorithms are spotting other features in histology that's [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2301.6800000000003s)]
*  clearly mapping to clinical traits and other things of interest that nobody's identified before. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2306.88s)]
*  And really noodling on that problem and how that might give us sort of an unfair advantage in the [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2313.84s)]
*  space I think is very interesting for us. Has that been a challenge as the leader of the company? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2318.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, you mentioned you put a lot of time and effort into that and that has paid off. It's [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2324.8s)]
*  yielded multiple points of enlightenment perhaps, right? Which inform a go-forward plan. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2330.56s)]
*  But is it particularly challenging for a leader like you and a company like this to balance [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2338.64s)]
*  I guess the effort and initiative that goes into, as you put it, sort of noodling around [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2347.52s)]
*  in those tools looking for insights with speed progress like investor expectations, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2354.48s)]
*  got to get closer to naming a candidate and putting a pipeline together. Just give me a [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2362.0s)]
*  little bit of your mentality on balancing that inquisitive person that you are with [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2368.64s)]
*  creating a business around a product. So I made this joke, a many joke on this topic, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2376.4s)]
*  a panel discussion I was giving a few days ago saying that I walk around with a giant wooden [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2383.68s)]
*  spoon and smack people when they get distracted. So that's my job to go, no, no, no, no, that's [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2387.68s)]
*  lovely, but not now. No, it's a lot of, if I had to summarize a lot of the intent behind us as a [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2394.16s)]
*  company is learning how to fail fast with good data. That's not a million miles from the kind [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2404.0s)]
*  of rhetoric that we've had for a long time in the therapeutic space. So if we're going to fail fast, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2411.12s)]
*  learn to fail fast, don't hold on to ideas forever. And it's tough. I'm not going to pretend [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2417.7599999999998s)]
*  that we get it right all the time because sometimes it's very difficult to know where the value of [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2425.2799999999997s)]
*  something is going to come from. But if you've tried it for one quarter and the results are not [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2430.64s)]
*  great and you've tried it for a second quarter, it's still not great, probably time to kill it. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2438.08s)]
*  One thing that we found really useful as a company in terms of, you mentioned operations and how you [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2443.68s)]
*  do things is we've set up a separate team, which we call XLab, very, very California. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2449.92s)]
*  But the whole idea of XLab is- So this was prior to Elon Musk rebranding Twitter, I'm assuming? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2456.64s)]
*  Now we take notes just all the time. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2463.6800000000003s)]
*  And the whole notion of XLab is to have a team that's dedicated to the new link, to the de-risking. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2469.04s)]
*  If we see somebody out there with a new technology and we want to collaborate with them on that, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2477.04s)]
*  can we play around with it? Can we de-risk it before we hand it over to the rest of the team? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2482.4s)]
*  I think that formula has helped, has really, really helped us as a company. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2487.92s)]
*  If you kind of characterized, you talked about your excitement around the transplant space. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2495.76s)]
*  Would you envision a commercial stage ochre as competitive, like looking to transplant, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2503.84s)]
*  to displace the transplant space or to compete with the pharmaceutical products on the market [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2513.52s)]
*  for liver disease or both? Is it just a yes? Yeah, I think it's both really. It's like I said [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2521.12s)]
*  a few minutes ago, I think for us, it's about first focusing on the supply issue. So that is [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2527.44s)]
*  directly improving outcomes and utilization in the transplant space and then ultimately dealing [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2532.96s)]
*  with the demand issue, which will hopefully one day eventually do away with the need for transplant [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2538.32s)]
*  altogether. Yeah. All right. I want to shift gears here a little bit, being conscious of our time, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2543.6000000000004s)]
*  because I have a few questions that I've been looking forward to asking you around sort of [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2548.56s)]
*  your management philosophy, because I'm here to tell you, like anyone who's either watching this [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2553.28s)]
*  on YouTube or listening in their car on the way to work is thinking, they're thinking, man, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2558.88s)]
*  that Dr. Will's guy, he just seems like a really nice guy. And I've talked to you a couple times [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2566.24s)]
*  now and I think you're a really nice guy. But the last time we talked, you told me a little bit [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2570.96s)]
*  about your management philosophy and I came away from that conversation thinking, man, he's got to [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2575.36s)]
*  be hard to work for. I told you I carry a very big wooden spoon. I know, I know you're validating my [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2580.24s)]
*  concern. No, it's not concern, but you did share with me some of your philosophies around value [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2587.44s)]
*  based innovation. Now, we talk about value based innovation, like in this big broad general sense [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2594.08s)]
*  and in life sciences, and it's easy to go like, oh, we're talking about patient value, health [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2598.72s)]
*  outcomes, right? Stuff like that. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about value [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2604.64s)]
*  based innovation in a far more fundamental context when you talk about it. So tell us what it means [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2608.56s)]
*  to you. Yeah. So I'll start off by saying, I first say I can't take full credit for this. One of [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2616.88s)]
*  the things I've been very blessed to have is a co-founder who shares this notion with me that [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2624.0s)]
*  a lot of starting a company is about having the right values and norms and how you focus on ideas. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2629.04s)]
*  And we really settled on these three laws that I'm going to tell you about before we even set up [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2634.56s)]
*  what the science is going to look like, et cetera. And these three, we call them laws. I tend to [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2641.36s)]
*  think of values as personal aspirations. Laws are no, you know, you'll get smacked with a big [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2646.88s)]
*  wooden spoon. And they really speak to what I've over many years of running teams feel are three [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2652.56s)]
*  of the big failure points of teams, particularly very transdisciplinary teams as we are. And the [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2660.48s)]
*  first law is Clark's law or probably Clark's third law really that says, you know, any sufficiently [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2667.12s)]
*  advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And the idea behind that is to help [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2675.52s)]
*  the teams, particularly on the European side of things, where we're a lot more risk averse, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2681.84s)]
*  to understand that we are here to be very bold in our innovation and ideas. Don't fear failure. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2686.08s)]
*  This is what we set up to do. If you want to do incremental, go work for a company. This is going [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2695.28s)]
*  to sound very rude. We go work for a comfortable academic lab. This is not the model that we're [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2700.6400000000003s)]
*  playing. We're really pushing hard to push things to the next level. So there's that whole idea. Be [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2705.1200000000003s)]
*  bold in your thinking and how you want to do things. Law number one. Law number two is [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2710.72s)]
*  Murphy's law. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. And I suppose if the first law is about, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2718.3999999999996s)]
*  don't fear failure, the second law is you are going to fail all the time, every day. It is [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2724.7999999999997s)]
*  fundamental to our learning process in science. We learn by experimentation and most of what we do [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2731.3599999999997s)]
*  goes wrong, particularly when it's in a very messy biotech space and you're building the jumbo [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2736.4s)]
*  while it's taking off. The essence of that for us is it's not an excuse ever. Do not come to a meeting [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2741.52s)]
*  complaining about that. What have you learned? What's your plan B? How fast can you recover from [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2748.88s)]
*  this and move on? That's the essence behind that. How to turn failure into success very quickly [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2754.7200000000003s)]
*  is the essence of that second law. And then we have our third law from Wil Wheaton. So [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2762.08s)]
*  many of us will know Wil Wheaton from Star Trek. I think Wesley Crusher. He's also a very big gamer [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2768.48s)]
*  and really in his adult life, I think many people know him for his involvement in the gaming space. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2774.7999999999997s)]
*  And he has this law called don't be a dick, which we love. And this is not about baking cakes and [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2780.08s)]
*  being lovely to each other and talking pleasantries about the weather. This speaks to really the third [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2789.28s)]
*  mode of failure that I've seen often happening in very transdisciplinary teams is tribalism. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2795.28s)]
*  It's so difficult to know when other teams fail, the intricacies of what's going on. And when times [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2804.2400000000002s)]
*  get tough, it's all too easy for the chemists to get angry with the biologists who have not set up [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2812.2400000000002s)]
*  the models correctly. You don't understand why the computationists are taking far too long to get [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2818.56s)]
*  the analysis back to them. And this happens all the time. It's such a natural human trait to want [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2823.52s)]
*  to blame the other. And so for us, that's the essence behind that third law of that is not [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2829.04s)]
*  allowed. It is really not allowed. And it doesn't matter how brilliant you are as a scientist, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2835.92s)]
*  if you cannot abide by that third law, we will ask you to go be a pretty flower somewhere else. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2842.4s)]
*  That third law, the illustration you gave around blame and specifically wet lab versus sort of [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2849.52s)]
*  computational. I say versus because sometimes I suppose it can come to that. But to avoid that, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2856.72s)]
*  I'm curious about your take on that. I've had multiple conversations with biotech leaders who [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2863.68s)]
*  are playing in computational who've said like, adversity aside or blame aside from day one, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2869.04s)]
*  it's a very difficult thing, super challenging to integrate those two departments and those two [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2876.96s)]
*  personas, which I think would probably go a long way toward cutting off any of that potential to [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2882.8s)]
*  be a dick, right? Cutting that off from the get go. So just give me a little color on that. What [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2888.8s)]
*  have you done organizationally to marry those two sort of disciplines? So when I say the word [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2894.88s)]
*  transdisciplinary, I'm saying that with intent. I have not said multidisciplinary. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2901.68s)]
*  Multidisciplinary is let's just put different phenotypes in the same room together and make [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2907.8399999999997s)]
*  them talk. Transdisciplinary is let's ensure that people can speak the same language, that you have [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2912.3999999999996s)]
*  enough of an understanding of what the other is doing to be able to communicate with them and be [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2920.3199999999997s)]
*  able to understand where the weaknesses are. So to make that even more specific, there are no [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2925.6s)]
*  wet lab, dry lab and okay, they are just scientists. Everybody's expected to be a [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2934.08s)]
*  biologist. Computationists need to understand the biology and speak to the biology. They just come [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2940.16s)]
*  with a different set of tools versus the saline molecular biologists. And I've been often quoted [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2945.6s)]
*  within the company as for example, telling the wet lab biologists that if you want a promotion [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2951.52s)]
*  in okay, you have to learn to code. And the vast majority of our experimental scientists now can [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2957.7599999999998s)]
*  code and can analyze their own data before they go to the computational biologists with more [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2964.08s)]
*  elevated questions than they would have if they just threw their data over. Yeah, I love that. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2970.64s)]
*  In a market that is challenging to find good help, right? Like talent is challenging to [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2976.4s)]
*  find good talent, especially transdisciplinary talent or even multidisciplinary before they're [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2985.12s)]
*  subject to your philosophy. Do those sorts of standards further challenge the effort at [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2992.48s)]
*  Oker to attract talent at that level? Like you say, hey, you're a great scientist, you've done [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=2998.3199999999997s)]
*  great academic work. I love your previous experience. You're going to have to learn to [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3004.32s)]
*  code. And they're like, I'm not learning how to code. I'm a scientist. Yeah. No, it's, and again, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3008.0s)]
*  we've had this where people come on and after six months, like, oh, I didn't realize that it's going [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3014.6400000000003s)]
*  to be this tough. I can't even hope that I would just hand over my data to somebody else to look [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3021.76s)]
*  after, for example. And those people have left on good terms, but they have left. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3028.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. All right. I know we're running short on time, so I'm going to wrap it up here, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3034.8799999999997s)]
*  but I just want to get one last question. You're an advocate for, you know, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3038.7999999999997s)]
*  founder-led biotechs. What does that mean to you and why is it important? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3044.16s)]
*  So what it doesn't mean is it doesn't mean the arrogance of founders know everything. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3049.2s)]
*  That I need to be very clear on. I am very blessed to be standing on the shoulders of giants. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3054.6400000000003s)]
*  I have so many smart people around me. My average day is a severe case of imposter syndrome, so I [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3061.92s)]
*  need to be very clear. I find that pretty hard to believe. I mean, you want to talk about imposter [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3068.48s)]
*  syndrome, let's talk about me. I dropped out of AP Bio my senior year of high school. I have an [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3074.0s)]
*  English degree and I spend my time talking to guys like you. That's, you know, you just. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3078.24s)]
*  And you're pulling at them. It's like, great. Arguable. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3083.04s)]
*  And there is that. There really is that. There is a lot about having smarter people around you. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3088.9599999999996s)]
*  And biotech is not the same as tech. We do need people who've been there, done that, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3093.9199999999996s)]
*  because we put in medicines in patients. We can't move fast and break things. That's not allowed. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3098.64s)]
*  So there is an element of that. However, and there's the small asterisk, however, to this. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3104.24s)]
*  I do feel that if you're playing in the space of biotech that I call tough tech. So, you know, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3111.2s)]
*  there's a lot of variations on what biotech is, right? People talk about tech bio and in very [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3117.44s)]
*  different flavors. Where I just consider as a science company that is using a lot of biotech [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3122.0s)]
*  and technology, tech bio to make therapies stacking a lot of risk, as you've said. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3128.0s)]
*  So it's a very tough tech because we really there's a lot going on at any one time. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3134.48s)]
*  And there's a lot to follow and a lot of very difficult decisions to make. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3140.32s)]
*  My belief is that those kind of decisions are best made by very empowered founders [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3144.56s)]
*  who know what they're doing in the space. And so my encouragement to a lot of VCs out there who [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3151.44s)]
*  have this idea of this is really interesting, we'll invest that we're going to parachute in [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3156.4s)]
*  a C-suite is to maybe think about how you can empower those founders to really lead that company. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3161.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot. I mean, we could go much further on that. And I'd like to have you back on [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3168.32s)]
*  your blast to talk to. And I feel like there's so much more that we can dig into that would be [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3176.32s)]
*  valuable to our audience. So we'll make some plans. We'll make some plans to get back together again. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3180.64s)]
*  But in the meantime, I'll let you off the hook for now. I really appreciate you coming on. It's [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ygx1xYAG9Q&t=3185.12s)]
