Video Description: We spend a lot of time talking with our guests about building biotech companies. That’s true of this episode too, but today we’re taking a step further with John Leonard, M.D., longtime CEO at Intellia Therapeutics. In addition to how he’s built late-clinical stage Intellia, Dr. Leonard shares the foundational elements of a biotech community, particularly around rapidly-advancing technologies such as CRISPR, and what biotech ecosystems offer emerging biotechs in terms of resources, intellectual property, and support. Turns out that despite his proximity, Boston isn’t the prerequisite it used to be. This is an instructive conversation with an industry vet who’s happy to share the wealth of his knowledge.

# Building A Biotech Hub With Intellia Therapeutics' John Leonard, M.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI)
*  The business of biotech is produced by LifeScience Connect and its community of learning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=0.0s)]
*  solving, and sourcing resources for biopharma decision makers. If you're working on biologics [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=5.2s)]
*  process development and manufacturing challenges, you need to swing by bioprocessonline.com. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=11.44s)]
*  If you're trying to stay ahead of the cell or gene therapy curve, visit cellandgene.com. When it's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=17.12s)]
*  time to map out your clinical course, let clinicalleader.com help. And if optimizing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=22.72s)]
*  outsourcing decisions is what you're after, check out outsourcepharma.com. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=28.4s)]
*  We're LifeScience Connect, and we're here to help. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  Ask anyone who's been my guest on the business of biotech, and they'll tell you that it takes [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=40.08s)]
*  more than a novel molecule to build a biotech. A lot more. Intelliatherapeutics president and CEO [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=44.32s)]
*  Dr. John Leonard certainly knows it. At his core, he's a molecule guy, did his postdoc in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=51.84s)]
*  molecular virology, and spent the formative years of his career in R&D. But he's also a business [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=57.12s)]
*  builder, and he's learned that it takes a community of diverse resources, an ecosystem, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=63.68s)]
*  if you will, to build a successful biotech. I'm Matt Piller. This is the business of biotech, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=68.96s)]
*  and on today's show, we're sitting down with Dr. Leonard for a discussion on the building [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=73.84s)]
*  blocks of biotech, building blocks that reach well beyond the four walls of the business. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=77.44s)]
*  Dr. Leonard, welcome to the show. Great to be here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=82.64s)]
*  I'm thrilled to have you here. When this idea, the conversation idea was thrown my way, I thought, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=86.8s)]
*  man, I've been excited for this one for a while, because I think it's a great, great topic, and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  it's super timely right now. We're at sort of an inflection point in the way that we do business. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=96.64s)]
*  I mean, you know, well, I should say a few years into an inflection point in the way we do business, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=101.6s)]
*  and I'm curious. I've got lots of questions for you about how that inflection point has impacted, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=106.0s)]
*  specifically the biotech business, and we'll get into that, but I want to start with a little bit [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=110.72s)]
*  of you, right, to kind of get your perspective, get some context as to, you know, where you come [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  from and what you bring to this conversation. And that starts with, you know, when I look at [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=121.28s)]
*  your CV, I see R&D, R&D, R&D, SVP Pharmaceutical R&D at Abbott, SVP Global Pharmaceutical R&D [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  at AbbVie before that and beyond. And then you've got this MD in molecular virology [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=134.4s)]
*  back in the 80s, not to date you. There's a little bit of- [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=142.32s)]
*  You just did, but that's all right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  I did too, blatantly. There's a little bit of a gap there I'm curious about. Like, when you came [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=148.96s)]
*  out of academia, you know, pretty prestigious academic experience, then there's a bit of a gap [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=153.68s)]
*  before you joined industry, at least date-wise. So I'm just curious, like, what you were doing then, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=160.08s)]
*  what sort of filled that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=165.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's, there's really no gaps. Everything led directly into the next thing. I went to medical [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  school in the early 80s. I graduated in 1983, so there's a date for you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=177.6s)]
*  You've officially, yeah, made it official on data. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=184.16s)]
*  Very, very official. But it's an important date, because at that time, the AIDS epidemic was just [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=186.24s)]
*  beginning. In fact, when I was in medical school, some of those very first case reports came out. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=193.04s)]
*  So I was in medical school on the East Coast at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=199.84s)]
*  which really was not the epicenter of AIDS. And in fact, when I was doing my basic medical training, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=207.2s)]
*  it was just, you know, maybe a few hundred case reports in the literature, it wasn't called AIDS, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=214.56s)]
*  even at that time. I mean, it was a condition that had been noted. When I graduated from [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=220.8s)]
*  medical school, I went to the West Coast. I did my medical internship and residency at Stanford, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=227.12s)]
*  and at that time, we rotated through as interns, San Francisco General Hospital. So in the few years [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=232.96s)]
*  between, you know, just beginning my ward work, and actually, you know, being an intern, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=241.36s)]
*  the AIDS epidemic had exploded. And at San Francisco General Hospital, they actually had an AIDS [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=249.28s)]
*  ward. So when I got there as an intern, you know, the disease now had a name, the numbers were [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=253.76s)]
*  skyrocketing. And in a place like San Francisco, which was certainly one of the epicenters, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=261.12s)]
*  it was inescapable. And it's really that experience, I think that in many, many ways influenced my [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=267.2s)]
*  ultimate career and career choices. Because while there, you know, you see a new condition appear [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=276.24s)]
*  that, you know, just a few years ago, nobody knew about. You see a condition for which [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=288.72s)]
*  we don't know what the cause is. And if we don't know what the cause is, we have very few [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=295.68s)]
*  means to actually treat it, certainly not the disease itself. And so it was one of these things [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  where I'm starting out my medical training, and immediately you're at the end of the pharmacopeia, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=305.92s)]
*  so to speak. Where do these things come from? How do they happen? Where does medicine come from? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=310.48s)]
*  Which really, you know, I'd say started my, you know, initial thinking that maybe I would do [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  something other than, you know, traditional medicine. And, you know, maybe the gap you're [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=327.36s)]
*  referring to is after my internship and residency, I wanted to get more molecular because I just, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=331.84s)]
*  it just seemed that if you're going to understand the answer to some of these questions, or at least [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=341.76s)]
*  how to address them, I needed to have something other than just my medical training. So I went [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  to the NIH, that was 86 to 89, and worked in a laboratory that happened to be one of the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=353.68s)]
*  two AIDS labs at that time at the NIH. And, you know, you abandond the clinical thinking, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=363.44s)]
*  because that's just not part of what that work is. And you're surrounded as a physician by PhDs, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=371.92s)]
*  immersed in a world that was quite different from, you know, the medical training that I'd have. And [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=377.68s)]
*  I would say that was sort of the dividing point for me as to whether I would go and be sort of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=382.8s)]
*  a standard academic clinician or, you know, be in a position that can, you know, continue a line of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=389.04s)]
*  research that ultimately is what I did. Yeah, that's fascinating. So was it, I mean, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=397.12s)]
*  was at that point in time sort of the AIDS influence that moved you? Like, prior to that, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=402.64s)]
*  I should say prior to that, were you intending to be sort of the traditional academic clinician? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=409.04s)]
*  You know, I was always interested in clinical medicine. I enjoyed learning about it. I learned [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=415.6s)]
*  a lot from my patients. You know, when we were in a position where you could actually make a [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=425.04s)]
*  difference that I was rewarding in its own way. And I like the process of, you know, trying to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=430.72s)]
*  figure out diagnostically what's going on and then intervening. But I think I was so influenced by, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=436.64s)]
*  you know, that experience with AIDS, along with, I guess, while at Stanford, it's a, you know, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=445.2s)]
*  at that time was a tertiary referral center for oncology. And, you know, a lot's happened in these [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  last 40 years. So at that time, it was in many respects similar to, you know, HIV infection, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=459.2s)]
*  which just, we had some ideas, but the, you know, the tales and the granularity of our understanding [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  was just really beginning to be what it is. So I became just really interested in going beyond [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  recognizing the disease and trying to intervene and peering more deeply, I guess is a way of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=483.28s)]
*  saying it, into what the disease process was and finding other ways to actually, you know, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  intervene at the source. And, you know, as I was at the NIH and I got more deeply into, you know, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=495.67999999999995s)]
*  the strictly research approach, I realized that it was going to be very hard for me to go and do [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=504.4s)]
*  clinical work and research at the level that I was hoping to do it [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  in what was available to me at that time. So I decided to embark on a career [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=518.4s)]
*  in industry, which I realized while I was at the NIH is where most of the drugs came from. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=523.2s)]
*  And I wanted to be a part of that process. Yeah. Yeah. And when I, you know, so your, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=530.64s)]
*  your experience in R&D speaks for itself. I mean, you had a long storied career with some big [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=535.84s)]
*  companies in R&D. Excuse me. And, you know, I could spend the next 45 minutes talking with [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=541.12s)]
*  you about that. In fact, I'm going to go on public blast. I'm going to put you on blast publicly [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=547.52s)]
*  right now. We have a, we're doing an R&D, a bioprocess online live event in January on R&D. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=551.76s)]
*  I'm going to publicly invite you right now to be a panelist on that, on that event. I'll follow [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=560.08s)]
*  up with your PR team on that. I'll have my people talk to your people. That sounds good. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=564.32s)]
*  But we're going to skip, we're going to, for the, for the intents of this, this conversation, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  we're going to fast forward. All right. So, you know, you did a bunch of R&D work at Abbott and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  AbbVie. And we're going to fast forward all the way to 2014 and start talking about your, your [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=576.8s)]
*  leadership and building Ventilia. You joined the board there in 2014 and, and took on a role that [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=582.56s)]
*  was familiar to you again, an R&D, EVP of R&D before assuming the head post there just, just a [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=589.68s)]
*  few years later. So I guess before we get off the R&D train completely, I'm curious about how your [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=595.44s)]
*  experience, your long experience in that realm influenced your role in the, in the C-suite, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=603.5200000000001s)]
*  you know, as the, as the leader at Intelia. Yeah, it's, I had been at Abbott for Abbott, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=612.8800000000001s)]
*  AbbVie for 22 years. And I was in the R&D organization and I led it for a third of the, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  that time. When I stepped out of AbbVie, I did not plan on, you know, recapitulating my career, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=625.6s)]
*  having some operational role, and had been asked if I'd be willing to, you know, provide some advice [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=637.84s)]
*  and thinking with respect to where, you know, CRISPR technology might go, you know, in terms [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=644.8s)]
*  of putting a company together. So I agreed to think about that, you know, from a strategic point. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=651.3599999999999s)]
*  You know, it's the, you know, it's the difference between the cool public biology that had been [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=656.64s)]
*  reported and actually making a product and having it be relevant for patients. And I was not, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=663.28s)]
*  certainly a CRISPR scientist, but I did have a lot of experience thinking about what matters [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=671.84s)]
*  for patients and how to get technology there. So that's why I tried to help, you know, think, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=676.0s)]
*  thinking down the road as to where, you know, this work could be applied and where it could take us. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=682.48s)]
*  And ultimately, while you're right, I was on the board, they had this advisory role. I ultimately [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=689.52s)]
*  came into the company to actually help with some of that. Yeah. So that's a good place to start [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=696.48s)]
*  talking about sort of these building, these big foundational building blocks of building a biotech [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=704.72s)]
*  and beyond, right? Building a biotech hub, building an industry, if you will, an ecosystem around [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=710.0s)]
*  technology. I mean, technology is one of those foundational elements. So I want to, I guess, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  get your sense of how fundamental CRISPR in this case is in terms of like being one of the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=724.56s)]
*  foundational elements necessary to building momentum, not just within a company, but within [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  an ecosystem or a region or a, you know, quote unquote biotech hub, however you might define [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  that. Like, would you say that something new to grab onto, you know, 30 years ago, monoclonal [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=746.88s)]
*  antibodies were kind of a corollary? You know, it's interesting the way you asked the question. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=752.72s)]
*  In a modeled way. It's an interesting... [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  I wasn't thinking about that, but I had occasion to give a talk recently in Chicago. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=763.84s)]
*  Abbott's there and I have many ties to the area about building a biotech hub and what it takes. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=772.48s)]
*  And so as I thought about what to tell that group, I went and I looked at the history of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=780.24s)]
*  the Boston Cambridge biotech hub. And it was really interesting. You know, it's what I saw, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=788.0s)]
*  at least what I took away from the history that I was able to glean, was at least in the case of [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=796.48s)]
*  Boston. I think it's also true in the Bay Area, where there was a new technology. This is [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=805.28s)]
*  recombinant DNA. And, you know, the pharma industry at that time was largely staffed by chemists, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=813.36s)]
*  much more so than microbiologists. And some of the true innovators were academicians who had [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=821.6s)]
*  proficiency with this new approach and believed that you could go and use it to [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=831.28s)]
*  think about, you know, making medicine. And in the early days was very much about cloning genes, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=838.16s)]
*  you know, insulin and clotting factors and things that... growth hormone, for example, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=845.68s)]
*  things that were missing from certain disease states. And so I think there's certainly precedents [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=851.68s)]
*  where a technology, a major advance can serve as the basis for a burst of innovation. And [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=858.24s)]
*  depending who does that and where that takes place, you can imagine, as was, I think, the case in both [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=867.92s)]
*  the Bay Area and Boston, that serving as the kind of the night is for something new happening. And [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=875.28s)]
*  then all of the kind of attendance related sort of technologies spring up around it. I think now [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=881.36s)]
*  with CRISPR, you know, I see it's certainly having the same sort of impact. But I don't see it so [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=887.2s)]
*  far, at least driving new biotech hubs. I see it, you know, sort of nesting, if you will, in the [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=901.44s)]
*  established hubs and drawing from these other technologies that have grown up around, you know, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=908.0s)]
*  you know, microbiology and genomics and delivery modalities, gene-based medicine, et cetera, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=914.72s)]
*  and enabling CRISPR in a way that would not have been possible many, many years ago. So... [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=922.16s)]
*  Scott Cunningham Do you think that's a product of the portability of information and, I guess, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=930.24s)]
*  the portability of people now compared to perhaps back when Boston and the Bay Area were [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=937.44s)]
*  starting to burgeon? Dr. John Baxter [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=947.04s)]
*  Well, I know, if I understand your question, I'd say, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=948.08s)]
*  imagine that CRISPR had appeared 40 years ago, 50 years ago. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=955.44s)]
*  So, it would have been a fascinating technology that, my guess is, would have, you know, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=962.96s)]
*  spent a lot of time in the laboratory and a lot less time as it's doing now headed toward the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=973.0400000000001s)]
*  clinic and patients, et cetera, because there were a whole set of other things that needed to happen, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=979.6800000000001s)]
*  the need to exist when CRISPR came along to be able to be, you know, apply technology for [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=986.56s)]
*  making a medicine. And when I think about that, you've got to have a basic understanding of [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=994.16s)]
*  genomics. I mean, the human genome worked out, the ability to get large-scale genomic information [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=998.0s)]
*  very, very fast and efficiently when you think about these studies that we do to determine [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1006.9599999999999s)]
*  where CRISPR goes, how it behaves, the specificity of it. If we were sequencing DNA today, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1012.0s)]
*  the way that we did 40 years ago, it would be prohibitively expensive and incredibly slow. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1019.04s)]
*  Delivery technologies that have only evolved in the last, you know, 10, 15 years or so needed [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1024.32s)]
*  to be there for CRISPR to be relevant. So, you know, it's different from, you know, recombinant [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1032.4s)]
*  DNA when it was the idea you could splice a piece of DNA into another piece of DNA in a very specific [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1039.6s)]
*  way. Here, the ability to, you know, go into the genome, change a particular nucleotide in some [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1045.52s)]
*  part of the body just requires all of these other things to exist that have evolved and come to be [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1054.32s)]
*  over the course of these last 30, 40 years. So it's like a lot of things, you know, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1063.9199999999998s)]
*  there's certain things that are ahead of their time and there are certain things that, you know, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1069.28s)]
*  come into being when, you know, the time is right and take off and are successful. And I think that's [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  certainly been the case here. You know, I guess it's a long-winded way of saying that, you know, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1079.44s)]
*  CRISPR, you know, to your question about biotech hubs, benefits from the existence of the already [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1086.0800000000002s)]
*  present hubs and the technology that they've built up that can be applied. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1094.56s)]
*  Yeah. And that technology that they've built up, and I'm also assuming the research resource. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1099.44s)]
*  So talk a little bit about that. Like, you know, if I'm in Boise, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1107.6799999999998s)]
*  take CRISPR out of the equation, I'm in Boise, I discover a novel molecule and I'm like, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1113.2s)]
*  okay, cool, I got something I want to build, right? Like I want to build something around this. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1117.36s)]
*  I need some, I need some intellect. I need some people. I need some research capacity, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1121.52s)]
*  right? Like, and it's not handy, right? So how important is that Boston, like, physical and IP [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1126.4s)]
*  infrastructure? You know, it's a really interesting question because there are [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1135.68s)]
*  a lot of cities right now that see the success that certainly has played out here in Boston or [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1142.24s)]
*  in the Bay Area to a certain extent and Research Triangle and San Diego and places like that. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1151.28s)]
*  Well, I'm going to throw my home state in there real quick, John. So Philadelphia wants to stake [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1158.24s)]
*  its claim right now as a cell and genome and ATMP hub, and they're doing a great job, you know, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1166.48s)]
*  but similarly, you know, similarly Philly has resources like Penn and a great healthcare network, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1172.4s)]
*  a great, you know, CHOP, they got a great hospital system down there. So like similarly, you know, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1181.28s)]
*  they're, you know, they're aided by a pretty good extended network or infrastructure. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1186.4s)]
*  Yeah, that was an unintended omission. I mean, absolutely. That's certainly the case. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1192.48s)]
*  You know, I would say this. You can do it almost anywhere. But it gets progressively harder [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1196.96s)]
*  as you move away from places where the skill sets are resident and call it abundant quantities, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1208.4s)]
*  right? I actually think the pin is example you gave is a really excellent one where [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1216.72s)]
*  they are leading many respects the whole Cartier revolution. It came from, you know, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1224.88s)]
*  Carl June and a group there that came up with an idea that played it out and it spread from there [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1230.08s)]
*  as it was picked up in other areas. So it's like, well, what are the critical elements? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1237.76s)]
*  You need an insight, you know, you need people who can come and work on that. You can be virtual up [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1242.88s)]
*  to an extent, but depending on how, you know, large the undertaking is and how far you want to go, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1253.92s)]
*  I think virtual organizations have many, many limitations. You need to have a source of funding [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1259.44s)]
*  of funding. And, you know, money is certainly portable, although it tends to reside [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1266.16s)]
*  preferentially in certain areas where venture groups, etc. set up and have access to, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1275.76s)]
*  you know, individuals and institutions, etc. But it's portable. I think really one of the key [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1283.28s)]
*  things as an entrepreneur, you know, somebody who's driven to make something happen, who's got a [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1288.96s)]
*  notion of what's possible in ideally, there are exceptions, but ideally the experience [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1296.3200000000002s)]
*  to go and understand what it takes to make something happen. I mean, you can have a lot [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1302.96s)]
*  of inspired people who want to go change the world, whatever. But if you don't have, you know, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1307.2s)]
*  some experience or can't, if you can't partner with somebody who does, you can make a lot of [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1314.56s)]
*  mistakes, waste a lot of money, waste a lot of time and lose the enthusiasm or the support of [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1320.24s)]
*  the people with the money that you need to make this stuff work. So, you know, I think [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1325.76s)]
*  biotech is in the early days, you know, very much a local phenomena, but it is far more portable [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  as the number of people who have, you know, played in the area and gained experience grows. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, for the that entrepreneur in Boise, and for all I know, there are companies, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1347.84s)]
*  I haven't looked into the biotech environment. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1353.84s)]
*  I don't know. It was the first like remote sounding city that popped into my head. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1355.84s)]
*  And a fine, you know, and I'm sure somebody wants to do it. And, you know, it's, I wouldn't say it's [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1359.84s)]
*  impossible. I just say it's harder than in other places. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1365.28s)]
*  Yeah. Even in places where, places like Boston and Philadelphia in the Bay Area that are flush [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1367.84s)]
*  with, with, with intellect and, you know, with, with the, with the, with the, with the, with the [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1375.28s)]
*  intellect and research capacity. Some of these newer technologies, like, I mean, you know, you [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1382.64s)]
*  talk about the early days were common at DNA in Boston, you know, CRISPR now there are multiple, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1387.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, ATMPs where they're being developed right now that perhaps require or could benefit [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1393.92s)]
*  from skill sets that aren't even fully developed at MIT. So, so let's talk about that a little bit. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1403.2s)]
*  I want to kind of get your sense like as you've built Antelia, you know, as you've, as you've, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1410.32s)]
*  as you've dug deeper into some, some technology that's, that's new, some stuff that's not been [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  seen before. How do you, how do you develop that talent? Like how do you make, how do you ensure [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1422.72s)]
*  that you've got people who, you mentioned, you said earlier, you've got to have people who can [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  work on that specific research or that specific, but in some cases, I want to say that there's [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1434.96s)]
*  people who, it might be more important to have people who want to, like maybe aren't trained to, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1440.72s)]
*  but want to. Would you say that's true? Yeah, it's, it's a really interesting question. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1445.52s)]
*  I mean, by its nature, innovation means doing something new. And if you're doing true innovation, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1452.0s)]
*  you're going to be doing a lot of new stuff. In almost all cases, building on things we know, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1461.36s)]
*  drawing from, you know, experiences we've had, et cetera, but trying to, you know, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1468.64s)]
*  channel that in a way that accomplishes something that hasn't been done before. And you know, it's, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1476.16s)]
*  it's not, it's not like, you know, some quantum theorist looking at the world for the first time [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1482.64s)]
*  and coming up with just a novel way of seeing things that feels like a departure from where [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1490.8799999999999s)]
*  we've been. Oh, so you're letting, you're opening the curtain up on this Wizard of Oz-like [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1498.24s)]
*  perception that so many people have. Well, yeah, that's why you say that, because I do think when, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1504.56s)]
*  when I talk to people that I know who are not technical people, but you know, friends, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1512.1599999999999s)]
*  colleagues from other things, when I talk about what we do, it very quickly becomes, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1518.88s)]
*  you know, a black box for them or, you know, in the most, you know, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1529.92s)]
*  extraordinary sense, probably magic, you know, I mean, it's like with high expectations, no less, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1537.2s)]
*  you know, that's, that's the thing of it, right? Like the black box, you know, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1543.0400000000002s)]
*  the black box, but, but there's such, there's such high expectation. Yeah, it's, it's, I mean, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1546.8s)]
*  I'll stick with the magic thing for a minute, because it's, it's, I don't mean the sound, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1557.04s)]
*  you know, I don't know what the proper word is, you know, like devoid of, you know, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1563.76s)]
*  reality or anything like that. But for when you're talking to a person who doesn't understand [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1572.4s)]
*  some of the basic scientific aspects of what we do, when, you know, if people live in the world of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1578.0s)]
*  science understands one thing leads to the next, and, you know, something's deruitive, the other, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1587.2800000000002s)]
*  and the related, etc. But if you've never thought deeply about that, and you're having a conversation [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1591.92s)]
*  with somebody who's working on your house, for example, you know, you know, who hasn't, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1598.24s)]
*  may not have thought about this previously. And you, you describe that you're going to go into [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1605.44s)]
*  a person's body into cells of their name, the organ of your choice, find a particular gene, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1612.48s)]
*  and change some atoms in that gene, so that gene behaves differently. They are either swept up in, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1622.0s)]
*  this is extraordinary, this is, you know, tell me more, or it just, it does not compute, it doesn't [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1632.3999999999999s)]
*  don't have the technical wherewithal to really understand what that means. And it can be very [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1638.4799999999998s)]
*  frightening, it can be very alarming, or, you know, it just depends on, you know, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1646.5600000000002s)]
*  where one starts with all this stuff. Yeah. But yeah, we went on a we chased a we went [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1652.48s)]
*  on a rabbit hole there chase the new shiny moment. But I was what prompted that question was sort of [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1659.52s)]
*  my challenge that when when you're entering into a new research area, curiosity, just as much as [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1666.0800000000002s)]
*  curiosity of the of the scientific mind, just as much as knowledge, right, like a skill set in that [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1675.52s)]
*  particular technology might drive progress. And you were, you know, you were beginning to explain [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1682.8s)]
*  that that's, it's not necessarily, you know, the, as you said, it's not not magic. Right, exactly. I [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1688.56s)]
*  mean, and that's, you know, back to the the notion of experience, I mean, it's, it's knowing how to [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1696.0s)]
*  pose questions, and what questions are important and how to set up an experiment that is [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1702.48s)]
*  interpretable that, you know, builds on the knowledge you have, and it really comes down to, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1708.88s)]
*  you know, some of the new tools that we have, the ability to pose different questions and, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1714.24s)]
*  and do it in a way that is, you know, meaningful from the standpoint of a product that ultimately, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1719.92s)]
*  what helps to make. And so that's why I say the experience matters. I mean, it's one thing to [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1728.48s)]
*  you get your PhD and say, CRISPR, wouldn't it be cool, we could do x, y, and z, right. But if you [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1735.28s)]
*  intend to actually make that x, y, and z thing, that product, there's a process that one goes [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1743.2s)]
*  through, and you need to know how to, you know, build the basis of understanding what the [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1748.88s)]
*  experimental, you know, tools and processes are to actually get to what you want to achieve. And [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1757.44s)]
*  it's experienced scientists who may be coming from other areas that are somewhat related, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1765.5200000000002s)]
*  will understand how to do that, and they will get you there faster. They will do it in a way that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1774.56s)]
*  has fewer zigs and zags. And ideally, they'll do it in a way that is robust. And I, you know, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1782.08s)]
*  I'll give you an example. So here at the company, as we've grown, we've brought in folks who have [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1790.1599999999999s)]
*  extensive experience, leading groups, leading scientists, who have, you know, these individuals [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1799.76s)]
*  have done things, different systems, you know, but they understand how to carry out that research [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1806.08s)]
*  process. So you can take the enthusiast, you know, the new scientist and have that individual be [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1813.84s)]
*  very, very productive. And it's certainly played out, you know, in our work in the clinic thus far. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1821.6s)]
*  Yeah. Is there competition for those folks? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1827.12s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, it's, you know, things have cooled off a little bit in the last year, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1830.9599999999998s)]
*  year and a half, really, things going on in the market out there. But for, I'd say, three years [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1840.7199999999998s)]
*  or so, there was intense competition for people who have delivery technology, who have, you know, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1848.8s)]
*  basic insights into, you know, bioinformatics, which is core to what we do here. People with [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1857.6s)]
*  experience with nucleotide chemistry, etc. Everybody needs those people because there's [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1864.56s)]
*  so many different related efforts that draw on those expertises that, you know, are playing out [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1871.2s)]
*  in companies around the country. Yeah. How do you get them and keep them? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1879.76s)]
*  Well, one hopes that the mission, the culture, etc. is really inspiring and one where a scientist, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1887.52s)]
*  when he or she encounters it, feels like they can live a life of science in our organisation. So [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1897.92s)]
*  it's not just a job, it's not just a paycheck. You have to be competitive with that, of course. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1906.64s)]
*  But we try really hard to create an environment where people feel very connected to each other. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1912.0800000000002s)]
*  They understand how the science comes together, irrespective of the particular piece that they [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1922.8s)]
*  may do that may be, you know, 10 steps away from, you know, somebody else. And then we try very hard [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1928.88s)]
*  to connect them to the patient in the end. So they understand what this all adds up to and the [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1936.24s)]
*  difference that it can make. You mentioned capital, you mentioned, you know, finance, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1940.56s)]
*  money being a foundational element. And you also mentioned that things have cooled off recently. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1947.1200000000001s)]
*  As we're all aware. So from your purview, right, like if you're looking at the ecosystem, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1952.72s)]
*  the people, the research, the intellect, you know, the region, the resources that it takes to create [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1960.56s)]
*  a biotech community, finance being one of those resources. When any one of these resources is not [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1969.04s)]
*  working right as a biotech builder, you ask yourself why and how do we fix that? I mean, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1978.8s)]
*  I guess fundamentally like you think, oh, why isn't that working? Why don't I have that resource? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1984.08s)]
*  Why don't I have the, you know, whether it's intellect, people, money, whatever. So yeah, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1988.0s)]
*  so yeah, basic question. Like what's wrong with the market right now? And how do we fix it? It's a [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=1993.04s)]
*  basic but big question. But I mean, it's just in your perspective. Yeah, it's... Just one more real [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2000.08s)]
*  quick piece of context. You know, I have conversations, we drop 52 episodes a year. I [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2006.08s)]
*  have conversations week in and week out with biotech execs in the past three years since we [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2013.6799999999998s)]
*  launched this podcast. Like I've seen the growth of the technology and the tools just in the past [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2020.6399999999999s)]
*  three years, incremental. Like it's incredible. Right. The growth. Like there's no... I don't [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2025.84s)]
*  think there's a time in... I'm not going to say that because I don't have the history. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2033.6s)]
*  But I would venture, I would challenge. I would say it's arguable that there's been no time in [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2038.48s)]
*  history prior to this where the technology and the science have come together to the point where we [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2043.28s)]
*  have tools like we do today. And yet, you know, despite that advance and that promise, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2050.48s)]
*  people are having really hard time getting money and they're putting programs on shelves [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2056.96s)]
*  and back-burnering things that have great promise for patients because they can't fund them. What's [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2063.68s)]
*  going on? Well, first of all, I think most people would agree with you about the tools and insights [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2069.28s)]
*  comments that you made. I mean, it is unique, you know, and this is unprecedented, the things [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2074.88s)]
*  that we can do. And there's a lot of different people trying to do a lot of different things, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2080.4s)]
*  which is exciting. You know, if one's setting up a company, you're trying to [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2085.12s)]
*  get to a future that any investor will look for as coming with a payoff of some sort, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2098.0s)]
*  a return on that investment. And it's true whether you're in a big company, you know, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2108.72s)]
*  that has revenues and you're making decisions about how to, you know, set up the various [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2115.8399999999997s)]
*  programs that you can work on there. Or if you're starting out with a new company and you have a [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2123.04s)]
*  new technology and you're going to try to solve a problem. If one lives in the pre-commercial space, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2128.08s)]
*  like here at Intelliat, meaning that there's no products at this company that produce revenues, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2135.92s)]
*  then, you know, in some respects, it's a simple economic exercise. You say, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2143.2000000000003s)]
*  okay, well, what is that future? What might it be? What might it be worth? And as the economic [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2148.16s)]
*  circumstances change in the world, interest rates going up, more economic uncertainty, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2156.16s)]
*  related to macroeconomic events that no particular individual can control, you know, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2163.68s)]
*  people make a judgment that the risk is going up as well. And so, you know, if you think about what [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2170.2400000000002s)]
*  is a share price, you know, in the stock market is the discounted value of future earnings. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2175.68s)]
*  And if the future earnings are discounted at a higher rate because interest rates are up, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2182.88s)]
*  that means it's worthless today. And you can see that as you look across the industry in the [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2187.44s)]
*  pre-commercial space. In fact, especially those companies that are pre-pre-commercial, if you [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2193.68s)]
*  will, just starting out, they've all paid the price of having their future discounted very, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2200.0s)]
*  very aggressively. And that means that, you know, in the eye of the economist, the technologies [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2208.16s)]
*  are just not worth as much, you know, the returns not going to be there. And in fact, you know, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2217.8399999999997s)]
*  you actually have some people saying, well, I'll put my money in the money market and make my 5% [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2223.68s)]
*  a year, as opposed to taking a chance, I will lose everything on some novel thing that, you know, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2228.8799999999997s)]
*  we'll see if it works out or not. And that's what we're confronting right now. And plus, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2235.28s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that, you know, the pendulum swinging a little bit where, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2242.96s)]
*  you know, a couple of years ago, when money was virtually free, you know, interest rates were [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2248.0800000000004s)]
*  almost at zero. There was an abundance of companies that, you know, they could make that math work, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2254.2400000000002s)]
*  because it was discounted almost at zero. And so all of those companies at the same time [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2261.6s)]
*  are looking for ongoing continuing investments, you know, in this environment that is [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2268.48s)]
*  progressively more demanding. And so, you know, there's only so many investor dollars to go around. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2275.8399999999997s)]
*  Prospects, I think, are looked at much more stringently than, you know, a few years ago. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2283.12s)]
*  And you're seeing the consequences of that. And it's not inherently bad, but it does make it harder. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2289.8399999999997s)]
*  And one needs to be just better at what you do. Yeah, I was going to ask you for your advice for [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2298.08s)]
*  new biotech leaders of new biotechs, who are maybe, like you said, pre-preclinical, like just [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2308.3199999999997s)]
*  starting out now. One piece of advice might be like, find something else to do for a couple [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2314.24s)]
*  of years until things straighten out. Or don't start something that requires many, many years of [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2318.9599999999996s)]
*  progressive insights. I think, you know, companies that probably will do well starting now are ones [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2327.6s)]
*  that, you know, are shortened the path to a drug. I think investors will always be interested in [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2333.52s)]
*  something that, you know, will give them a return in just a few years. And you can see that with [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2340.96s)]
*  some of the companies that have been successful. Yeah. Yeah. So, Ad and Talia, like what have, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2345.2s)]
*  I mean, can you share any, I guess, experiences in terms of your leadership of the company through [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2351.28s)]
*  this kind of blip elite? I don't know if you'd call it a blip on the radar, but through this [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2357.92s)]
*  tough time, we'll just... Yeah, it's beyond a blip, I think. Yeah. I mean, is there, you know, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2364.0s)]
*  is there anything creative that you've learned or had to do or any lessons that you can kind of share [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2369.04s)]
*  with us around how to manage a company through this? Well, we never take our funding for granted. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2374.72s)]
*  And we try to be really thoughtful about what are the best places to deploy the capital. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2381.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's going to be a balance between things that, you know, maybe we're one or two [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2389.84s)]
*  steps away from an insight or those things that are just require more effort. So we try to balance [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2394.8s)]
*  that. You know, we try to take an approach with our budgets that, you know, that is tight, you know, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2401.6000000000004s)]
*  and make sure that we're getting the most out of our people, that we want them to understand that, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2411.76s)]
*  you know, the cliche money doesn't grow on trees, that, you know, these are valuable resources. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2419.04s)]
*  That, you know, make it possible to do our work. And so we don't hide that stuff. I mean, we talk [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2425.2000000000003s)]
*  about, you know, and I think that helps inspire better planning and thinking and, you know, but [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2430.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm always out there thinking about how to continue to keep this company finance. We never want to be [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2439.6000000000004s)]
*  in a situation where the runway is so short that there's uncertainty about, you know, will we get [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2445.52s)]
*  to the next step where there's true value creation and where I was, you know, thinking about, you [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2454.64s)]
*  know, think about it as, you know, stepping stones going across a brook to get to the other side. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2462.4s)]
*  We always want to make sure that we have sufficient runway to, you know, step across a few of those [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2467.6s)]
*  stones to make progress so that investors understand where we're going and feel confident that we will [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2474.24s)]
*  get to keep the promises that we make. Yeah. I want to get back to the community aspect, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2482.96s)]
*  right? Like the biotech hub sort of community, greater, you know, I guess it takes a village [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2490.88s)]
*  sort of mentality around Boston and the Bay Area and Philly and other places like that. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2496.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm always fascinated in this industry since I've been covering it. I've covered a lot of industries [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2502.56s)]
*  in my career and in most of them, you know, I covered high tech, I covered retail like years [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2509.12s)]
*  and years ago and competition was competition. Like it was, there were very thick walls between [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2515.84s)]
*  you and your competitors. In this space, you would, you know, the competition would seemingly be [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2521.7599999999998s)]
*  fueled, you know, fueled and just, it seems like it would be almost violent competition [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  for the rewards of success, right? In this business. And there is, like it is, it can be [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2538.72s)]
*  cutthroat, but at the same time, I've never been in an industry before where that community of like [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2546.4s)]
*  sharing and progress in advance, you know, preclinical, precommercial, obviously, has been so [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2553.12s)]
*  collaborative, open, you know, it's, you know, it's really hard for me to get my mind around it. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2560.64s)]
*  I'm not a simple person who's like, you know, we're either friends or we're enemies, you know [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2566.0s)]
*  what I mean? Like it's fascinating to me. So like in a community, in a biotech hub community, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2570.24s)]
*  you know, how do you, I guess I'm looking for your perception on how you, how you, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2577.84s)]
*  how you put up walls, how you guard yourself, how you allow collaborative exchange that fuels advance. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2584.24s)]
*  I'll give you something that, an example, something I thought was extraordinary. So [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2593.3599999999997s)]
*  as we said early on, I worked at Abbott Laboratories for a long time. And in the morning, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2600.0s)]
*  you would go through a gate with guards and security things. And, you know, it was a square mile, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2604.48s)]
*  you know, the headquarters. Yeah, I've been there. Yeah, I've been there. I can picture it. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2614.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was a special place. And we did a lot of great things. But the notion of having some [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2618.64s)]
*  person from a competing company there, it's just like, you do everything you could to exclude, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2627.2s)]
*  you know, that from getting into the company. Early on, I had an experience here where I was [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2632.72s)]
*  in a room talking about some things that I can tell you. And we got up to lower the shade, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2640.16s)]
*  because next door was a building with other scientists from another company who could [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2647.84s)]
*  watch the board as we're doing work. And so I mean, it's almost as if they were in the same room. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2654.32s)]
*  And that proximity was just mind blowing for me, you know? Yeah. I'd say what I've found, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2659.2000000000003s)]
*  I'd say it this way. Well, it's certainly true that there are certain [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2669.6s)]
*  treatments where it's maybe winner take all. If you cure something, and you know, it's you set the [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2678.4s)]
*  standard, and it's very hard for that standard to be overcome. And you're the first one there. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2687.44s)]
*  That would be an example like that. There's not many of those. But it's not a zero sum game, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  in most cases, where there's learning that takes place in the broader community that [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2701.68s)]
*  is applicable in so many different ways, with so many other uses, that there's this kind of [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2711.52s)]
*  you know, growing that takes place as people get insights that leads to formation of new companies [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2720.08s)]
*  or collaborations, or technologies that need to be shared because nobody can do it all, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2727.36s)]
*  particularly in smaller companies. And that's what I see. I mean, I've been really impressed by [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2734.48s)]
*  the incessant networking that takes place where people who have similar positions or roles in [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2743.84s)]
*  companies, I mean, they don't talk about their intellectual property, they don't talk about their [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2750.2400000000002s)]
*  key experiment, but they talk about what it is to do their job, things about shared problems and [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2754.08s)]
*  companies, how to make them better, etc. That makes the community stronger, as opposed to being on an [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2760.56s)]
*  island, trying to figure every single thing out for yourself, not drawing on the experience or [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2768.16s)]
*  wisdom of others, which I would say characterizes the first 20 years of my experience in this [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2774.96s)]
*  industry. Yeah, I don't know, I just I get this like, similar to the non-insiders perception of [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2783.6800000000003s)]
*  the way that the work that happens inside the black box and the dramatic expectations. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2793.84s)]
*  One can easily conjure up this vision of Boston where, you know, Dr. John Leonard is nervous on [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2800.0s)]
*  Friday nights, because he knows that his scientists are out and about on the town talking with other [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2806.48s)]
*  scientists. I mean, you know, you're hanging out in certain areas, like it's, you know, it's the [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2813.28s)]
*  biotech up. You just get the sense like, how do you make, at what point do you say, okay, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2819.92s)]
*  lock it down? You know what I mean? Lock it down, keep it safe. Yeah, on a Friday night, typically [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2826.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm really tired. So you're not worried about anything. Yeah. I guess I would draw a distinction [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2832.08s)]
*  between secrets, trade secrets, intellectual property, which are zealously guarded and [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2838.8s)]
*  protected versus ways of thinking, ways of working. That's, those are different things, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2848.88s)]
*  but that are related. I, you know, we all want to have the patent that says, you know, this antibody [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2860.6400000000003s)]
*  or this construct, whatever it is, has unique attributes and is, you know, there's value that's [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2871.76s)]
*  protected, et cetera. There's not sharing of that. But how to get there, the ways to do work, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2879.36s)]
*  is something that I think is, is maybe not freely flowing, but it is resonant in the community, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2890.5600000000004s)]
*  because we're all trying to solve similar problems with different ultimate end uses. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2899.44s)]
*  And so, I mean, there's conferences every week about some of these things, and it may not be, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2905.44s)]
*  you know, the most, you know, that morning's news, but it might be for people coming into the space, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2910.48s)]
*  useful information for them to bring to their work, et cetera. So that's the, that's what I'm [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2917.6s)]
*  talking about, just the resident expertise in the community versus the particular bit of information [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2922.64s)]
*  that relates to, you know, an individual product or, you know, a very, very unique and valuable [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2928.64s)]
*  insight. Yeah. Dr. Lerner, and we're getting short on time here, and I want to respect your time. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2934.48s)]
*  But I do want to give you an opportunity to talk a little bit about what is going on. You know, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2941.44s)]
*  we talk about, I liked your conversation around cash preservation and the stepping stone analogy. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2945.12s)]
*  That's a fantastic one. So I'll play off of that. Like, what stepping stone are you on [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2952.96s)]
*  and tell you right now? And what's the next stone you need to skip over to? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2957.68s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we have a long-term strategy that we're trying to play out in a very deliberate [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2963.44s)]
*  fashion. And we, there's really three parts to it. One is the CRISPR space is ever expanding, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2968.24s)]
*  and there's new insights and derivative forms, et cetera. We want to have what we call toolbox [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2977.6s)]
*  that allows one to edit DNA in whatever is the relevant format for a particular disease state. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2985.2s)]
*  So we continue to do that, et cetera. But it's really the application of that that has the [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=2993.2s)]
*  stepping stone approach where, you know, we've tried to take existing technology, apply it in [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3000.48s)]
*  a use case that will give us the confidence that things were behaving the way they were supposed to [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3008.16s)]
*  behave, and then expanding out from that. So the example would be knocking out a gene, our first [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3014.48s)]
*  program, which is TTR amyloidosis, knocking out a gene in the liver. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3021.04s)]
*  And then the question becomes, well, can you build up a gene in the liver? And then can you do that [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3026.2400000000002s)]
*  outside the liver? How do you extend that to other tissues that are more difficult to reach? And [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3032.96s)]
*  we're doing that work now where, you know, it's this, I'd say, accretion of insights, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3040.64s)]
*  where one thing builds on the other. And for those examples where you, you know, can take a cell [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3047.36s)]
*  outside the body, what we've tried to do is take a similar step by step approach where can we [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3054.24s)]
*  make cells that can come from another person and go into a different individual and do that in a way [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3062.16s)]
*  that enables all kinds of different approaches, whether for treatment of cancer or autoimmune [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3070.32s)]
*  diseases, or ultimately regenerative medicine. So one thing enables the next, but we want to make [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3078.32s)]
*  sure we get the foundation right. Excuse me, where, so from like a clinical perspective, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3085.04s)]
*  can you give us an update there? Like, where are you on that path? Right. So on that first [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3092.4s)]
*  format, knocking out genes in the liver, we've got a program for TTR amyloidosis, gives cardiomyopathy [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3096.3199999999997s)]
*  and polyneuropathy. We're now in phase three. And, you know, that is a step before the drug [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3104.08s)]
*  becomes available to patients. And we have another condition, hereditary angioedema, an unusual [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3110.56s)]
*  disease, but one that's ideal for a CRISPR approach, knocking out a gene in the liver, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3116.7999999999997s)]
*  which will likely be in phase three studies next year as well. So things have progressed, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3121.92s)]
*  and we're just beginning to treat patients where we build up a gene that's deficient in the liver [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3129.76s)]
*  for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a pulmonary, a genetic form of emphysema. And that's that [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3137.6s)]
*  stepwise format. And in the next, you know, many months, I suppose, we'll be in a position to [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3143.76s)]
*  take those same technologies outside the liver into whether it's the brain or muscle or the eye, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3152.88s)]
*  for example, all that stuff, all that work is underway. Yeah, very exciting. Super exciting. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3159.28s)]
*  Just real quick, one follow up question on the clinical pipeline. I often have conversations [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3167.2000000000003s)]
*  with companies that, you know, maybe have a late stage candidate than a real early stage candidate. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3171.2s)]
*  They're like, oh, we kind of got some filling to do, right? Like what's coming behind these two [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3176.7999999999997s)]
*  later stage candidates? I didn't tell you. Yeah, it's, again, alpha-1 antitrypsin, which is in [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3181.52s)]
*  phase one. We have in the later stages of discovery, ophthalmological diseases, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3189.76s)]
*  which, you know, it's a very delicate genetic cycle with that. And we're poised to begin some of our [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3202.4s)]
*  allogeneic ex-fibro work, which will go into the clinic and the immunology setting. So [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3210.0800000000004s)]
*  we don't have anything right in phase two after these, you know, later stage programs, but [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3217.2799999999997s)]
*  those programs are coming quickly. Yeah, very nice. Well, I appreciate the time, Dr. Lennard. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3224.32s)]
*  This has been very insightful. I know we meandered a bit, there's no doubt, which is that's typical [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3230.08s)]
*  of my line of questioning, you know, we covered some ground, but valuable ground. I really appreciate [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3235.52s)]
*  your insight and your transparency around, you know, what it's taken at Intellia and your thoughts [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3241.04s)]
*  on what it takes to build a biotech community. So thank you for coming on. It was my honor to have [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8DfTygyzI&t=3245.44s)]
