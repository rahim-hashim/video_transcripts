# CDMO Collab with Scorpius BioManufacturing's Steve Lavezoli + Fina Biosolutions' Dr. Andrew Lees
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [January 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA)
*  The business of biotech is produced by LifeScience Connect and its community of learning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=0.0s)]

*  So I've said it before, and I'll say it again now, CDMOs are typically not in the 10 ring or the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=40.08s)]
*  sweet spot of guest selection for the business of biotech podcast. We like to focus on new and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=47.12s)]
*  emerging biotech execs with their own therapeutic pipelines, or in other words, the sponsor companies [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=52.8s)]
*  that CDMOs work with. However, when a CDMO exec can bring along a sponsor exec for a transparent [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  look behind the scenes of what can at times be a complicated relationship, I'm all in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=67.2s)]
*  You might recall that we did this a few weeks ago when Ray Therapeutics, Jenny Holt, and Forge [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=72.8s)]
*  Biologics, John Maslowski, gave us some up close and personal perspectives on the contracting and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  execution of the sponsor plus CDMO relationship. That was a well-received episode. So today we're [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=85.28s)]
*  going to do it again. I'm Matt Piller. This is the business of biotech, and here with me today are [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=92.16s)]
*  FINA Biosolutions Scientific Director and Owner, Dr. Andrew Lees, and Scorpius Biomanufacturing VP [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  of Business Development and Client Partnerships, Steve Lavazzoli. Steve and Andy, welcome to the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=104.4s)]
*  show. Thank you. Nice to see you. Yeah, pleasure to have you guys on the show. I appreciate it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=110.72s)]
*  Lavazzoli, am I pronouncing that close enough to correctly? No, you got it. That's perfect. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=117.76s)]
*  Steve, I got to tell you, it's not a bone that I have to pick with you, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=123.76s)]
*  but I do want to just point out and put you on blast here publicly for stealing one of my favorite [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=128.32s)]
*  people in the world, sniping her away from our company, Abby Sorensen, who, by the way, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=136.32s)]
*  into her credit helped me arrange this interview and get you guys both on the horn at the same time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=142.64s)]
*  Thank you to her, but boy, she's one of my favorite people of all time, and you got a good one there, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=148.56s)]
*  buddy. Yeah, no, I have to agree with you. And actually, I think Andy will probably agree with [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=153.92s)]
*  you as well as it relates to Abby's involvement with Fina and, you know, just her ability to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=158.48s)]
*  bring Scorpius to a CMO that's known around the world that, you know, a year ago, nobody knew who [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=166.48s)]
*  Scorpius was. Now we're kind of recognized when I say the name Scorpius. People know who it is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=171.27999999999997s)]
*  Actually, that is exactly why we're here together is probably because of Abby. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  There was a period of time when I was getting essentially, it felt like daily or multi-times [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  per day emails from Scorpius, and I would just keep deleting and deleting and then, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=193.04s)]
*  you know, I saw they were, you know, a CDMO. We were, you know, looking around. I thought, well, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=199.76s)]
*  let me just see what they are, and I looked at it. I thought they kind of had a weird logo. I do [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=205.12s)]
*  a little origami, and I thought, and then I, you know, passed on. But then, you know, we were [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=210.32s)]
*  looking more and more seriously at a new CDMO, and they had also penetrated our commercial officers [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=217.52s)]
*  radar and the CMC group that we work with, and so they came to our attention, and we met with [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=228.08s)]
*  Steve and Abby, I think it was at BPI, and met there, had dinner, talked, and that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=242.08s)]
*  chemistry was really what, you know, from that meeting was really what started us down the path [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  of considering them. So that was, I mean, that, you know, once in a while a cold call and a random [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=259.36s)]
*  email does work and penetrate. It's getting there at the right timing. Yeah, and you said, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=268.4s)]
*  did I catch that right before we get to you, Steve? Did I catch that right that you had been [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=276.88s)]
*  working with a different CDMO previous to this relationship, or had you not been working with it? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=280.56s)]
*  We had been working with another CDMO, and I can give you a little bit of background about [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=286.08s)]
*  phenobio, because you need to understand a little bit of this. I started phenobio in 2006 [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=291.2s)]
*  based on my expertise in the area of protein polysaccharide conjugate vaccines, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=299.68s)]
*  specifically the chemistry, and early in my career I developed chemistry that is now widely used, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=304.56s)]
*  particularly for new manufacturers. It was licensed originally to Glaxo, but because there were no [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=311.36s)]
*  patents in China or India, I began working, when I started phenobio, I began working with the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=319.36s)]
*  Serum Institute of India, and the idea would be that although I can't affect prices, I could affect [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=326.0s)]
*  competition. And so by helping to bring in, teach the chemistry to new manufacturers, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=332.8s)]
*  I could bring in some competition in the developing world to help reduce the price of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=338.56s)]
*  these conjugate vaccines. And in fact, we've succeeded. The Serum Institute's pneumomeningococcal [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=344.8s)]
*  vaccines are the lowest priced vaccines in these classes. So part of the model, which I call [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=351.6s)]
*  not-for-much-profit model, is I don't have any investors. So what that means is I can make [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  licensing arrangements and do deals without having to make money for investors. So in terms of the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=369.76s)]
*  royalty rate, I looked at what did I used to get when I got royalties from India after it trickled [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  to everybody else, and I said if I was happy with that percentage then I'll take that percentage from [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=381.28s)]
*  the serum. And it was low enough that I essentially turned what was a service contract into a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  royalty stream, and that is now helping to fund the current work. The next phase, we were invited, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  we were asked to see if we could develop the protein component of these protein polysaccharide [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=405.76s)]
*  conjugate vaccines, which had been one of the most expensive components. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=410.56s)]
*  And remarkably, a scientist who had been laid off from Glaxo came on starting as a volunteer, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=416.64s)]
*  and then when we got a small contract from the non-profit PATH, that set us on the PATH to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=425.92s)]
*  develop this protein. And as part of that, we developed, and the scientist developed an [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=433.68s)]
*  E. coli strain that can make soluble disulfide bond proteins in the cytoplasm without needing [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=440.88s)]
*  to refold, and which grows remarkably well. And so that set us off to be able to produce the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=448.16s)]
*  lowest cost version of this protein, and I deliberately set the price as low as I could [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=457.76s)]
*  rather than as high as I could. This was not from any particular business smarts, but it had to do [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=463.36s)]
*  with I didn't have to make money for other people, and I was frustrated as a scientist that I could [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=469.68s)]
*  not afford to buy this protein previously. So because we had no money to do a GMP project, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=475.68s)]
*  what we did was execute a license, essentially a license exchange with the company InventPrize [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=486.64s)]
*  out in Seattle, which was founded by the former director from the Serum Institute of India. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  It's funded largely by the Gates Foundation, again to develop low-cost conjugate vaccines. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=498.56s)]
*  So they needed our CRM197, the carrier protein. We gave them the license to use it for their [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  vaccines in exchange for their doing GMP manufacturing. And so that created the first [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=512.8s)]
*  batches and got our GMP product established. But they need to now focus on their own vaccines, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=519.52s)]
*  and we need to establish our phenobio as having, you know, being a reliable supplier of the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  protein. So if your clinical program depends on our protein, you want to make sure we're going [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=537.04s)]
*  to be around. And that's why we're now we decided we needed to move to a larger manufacturer that [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  could support the phase three and licensure. Yeah. What kind of capacity are we talking about, Andrew? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=549.36s)]
*  You said a larger manufacturer. Right. Just give us a sense for what kind of capacity you need, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=558.64s)]
*  what you're putting out. This is still small scale by others. So because we have such a highly [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=564.0s)]
*  productive strain, we are making from the E. coli about three grams per liter of purified protein. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=569.76s)]
*  So even a relatively small fermenter, I think Scorpius is going to be going up to 300 liters. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=577.92s)]
*  So that's going to be making almost a kilo of product. So a few runs would likely, you know, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  supply for the next, you know, for the foreseeable future. And it would be very easy to scale up [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=593.2s)]
*  beyond that. It's just because it's E. coli, it's very simple to grow. And we have a relatively [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  simple purification process. Steve, I'll let you jump in here. What when you were when you first [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=604.96s)]
*  met when you first met Fina, and that's a great, that's a great story. I love it. You know, Andrew's [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=612.72s)]
*  giving you some pretty candid feedback about your origami logo and the way that he put off [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=618.16s)]
*  put off the cold calls for a long time. It's an important element of relationship building, though. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=624.24s)]
*  So one, I want to get your perspective on that, you know, what from your perspective made Fina [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=629.92s)]
*  a good fit for Scorpius, but also sort of your take on how Fina fits into the broader landscape [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=634.64s)]
*  of Scorpius clientele. Like, you know, it seems maybe a little bit a little bit atypical, but I'm [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=641.76s)]
*  curious about how they kind of line up in terms of jumping. It's very atypical. And that's really [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=648.16s)]
*  their willingness to adapt to this atypical is a big part of it. Atypical is kind of the key word, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=653.5999999999999s)]
*  right? I mean, I think, you know, I came from large CDMO world. And, you know, in the large [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  CDMO world, someone like Andy and his program, it would have never gotten any kind of attention [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=666.64s)]
*  from, you know, a big CDMO. It's just, you know, and that's not a shot at Andy or a shot at Fina. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=671.84s)]
*  It's just the, really where the focus is of that scale of a CDMO. So, I mean, we'll think about [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  Scorpius, you know, we're focused on both microbial and mammalian programs. We're also focused on a [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=684.64s)]
*  certain clientele, right? We want to be partnered with these smaller to mid-sized biotechs. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=690.48s)]
*  And essentially they can't get the type of attention, you know, certain expectations from [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=697.84s)]
*  a CDMO as far as willingness to work with them. And I think that, you know, Fina fits right into [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=706.32s)]
*  that. Andy fits into that. His personality, his willingness to kind of do things like this podcast [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=713.6s)]
*  and also do joint publications. You know, those are all important to us. It's important to Fina [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=720.24s)]
*  so that they can grow their business. And it's important to us from a new CDMO in the space. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=727.52s)]
*  And it really made sense, you know, after we met with Andy and I think he mentioned, you know, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=733.6s)]
*  Abby was with us and Abby does join a lot of those, you know, initial meetings. I don't think that's [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=738.88s)]
*  even something that's characteristic of most, you know, CDMO partnerships. You normally don't [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=744.32s)]
*  bring your marketing manager along with you to a dinner. And it's really so that Abby can understand [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=748.96s)]
*  or the marketing team can understand, you know, what are the pains of Andy? How can we help him [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=755.2s)]
*  support his business, grow his business, promote his business, and do things that other CDMOs just [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=762.08s)]
*  aren't doing, right? And hopefully Andy sees the value in that. And, you know, we'll continue to [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=769.2800000000001s)]
*  do those kind of things because it's important for him. It's important for us. And not only that, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=776.24s)]
*  you know, we're extremely dedicated to getting his program through, you know, GMP manufacturing [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=782.08s)]
*  and making sure that he can bring, you know, really, really cool technology to the industry that [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=786.72s)]
*  maybe he wasn't able to do if he didn't have a partnership like Scorpio. So that's the great [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=791.6s)]
*  thing about, you know, this relationship with Andy and Fina in my eyes. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  So I mentioned an important thing. Because we're providing an ingredient, essentially, in other [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=802.48s)]
*  people's conjugate, you know, other people's vaccines, it's going to take us a long time [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=808.96s)]
*  before we really scale up and start selling a lot of product and becoming, you know, highly [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  profitable from it. So it's really, but without having an established manufacturer and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=820.96s)]
*  demonstrating that, you know, we're going to be around in the, for the future, it's kind of this [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=828.96s)]
*  chicken and egg thing where we got to get established. And Steve and Scorpius were willing to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=835.52s)]
*  recognize that and accommodate, you know, that kind of scheduling. And it's, from that sense, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=840.24s)]
*  has been a really good partnership. And it's really the people. I mean, after this, you know, the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=850.88s)]
*  business meeting, we began meeting with the technical people. And there was no question [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=856.08s)]
*  when we met with them, from the questions that they asked, we felt very comfortable, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=864.1600000000001s)]
*  you know, working with them. This close communication, Steve is on my Joker the Day [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=870.32s)]
*  List that I send out. And, you know, we talk almost every day about various issues. And if I have, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=879.12s)]
*  you know, there is a concern, it's just as easy to talk to him first. And it's, that part has been [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=887.68s)]
*  very successful. The whole contracting process was extremely straightforward. And working, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=896.72s)]
*  you know, working with Steve has really been, Steve has really been a major part of why we're [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=906.64s)]
*  able to work together. His approach and willingness to see both sides of the issue, of the problems [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=912.64s)]
*  that we have, both Scorpius and ours, because they got to get, they need to move forward as a CDMO. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=920.88s)]
*  And you can't survive if you don't make some money. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=927.36s)]
*  Right. Right. Yeah. And that's a good segue. I wanted to go there next and talk a little bit [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=931.04s)]
*  about contracting and MSAs. You know, I've learned through doing interviews with CDMO plus sponsor [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=935.84s)]
*  execs, that even in, you know, the more straightforward, like, you know, Steve, maybe, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=943.76s)]
*  you know, you sign a contract with someone who's manufacturing an antibody, it seems pretty cut and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=948.5600000000001s)]
*  dried. But it's not always cookie cutter, you know, it's not always, there are always nuances. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=953.28s)]
*  In this situation, I mean, Andrew just said it was a pretty straightforward contracting experience, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  which surprises me a little bit, I guess, given that it's sort of an atypical. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  That's not quite true, actually. But straightforward, I mean, it went, we got through it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=969.6s)]
*  But yeah, and I had a lot of, I mean, I don't know how to do this kind of stuff. I'm not used to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=977.36s)]
*  seeing what's normal, what's abnormal. I had, you know, the outside consultants who were 100% [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=982.96s)]
*  guiding me on the process, and they were experienced. Yeah. And full disclosure, I mean, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=989.2s)]
*  I know that one of the challenges in doing a sort of a series of episodes, including a sponsor plus [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=995.6800000000001s)]
*  a CDMO, is that you can only go so deep before the sponsor, and or the CDMO, want to say, you know, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1002.88s)]
*  there are details to this relationship that we're not willing to make public. And I totally, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1010.0s)]
*  I totally get that. I totally understand. It's been a challenge, right? It's been a challenge to [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1013.92s)]
*  even get credit to you, Andy, for agreeing to come on. It's been a challenge to even get sponsors to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1017.44s)]
*  come on and talk about the work they're doing with their CDMOs. But to the extent that you can, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1022.72s)]
*  can you just kind of walk us through what that contracting experience looks like in such a way [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1027.76s)]
*  that might offer some advice for, we cater to new and emerging biotech leaders. So in such a way that [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1033.68s)]
*  might offer some advice to those who maybe haven't contracted with the CDMO before, but are [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1039.68s)]
*  entering that phase of their growth. Sure. So the first thing is our CMC consultant, Brevis [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1044.88s)]
*  Referro up in Canada, they have a contracting platform. It's called RFP Navigator. So about, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1052.5600000000002s)]
*  I think it was two years ago, we began on that. And we actually had selected another CDMO to go [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  forward with. And what happened was the royalties that I'd been receiving, it started to be, you [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1067.68s)]
*  know, we're going up steeply and then they took a sharp drop. And so I no longer had the money to [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1074.4s)]
*  go forward. So a year later at Bio, last, a year ago, June, or this last June, I guess, we put out [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1080.8s)]
*  another RFP and invited Scorpius to participate because now we knew about them. They didn't exist [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1089.3600000000001s)]
*  for the previous one. And looking at the entire package, you know, we selected them out of that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1097.28s)]
*  But it was, you know, the getting to know the CDMO ahead of time so that we had some idea [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1106.0s)]
*  about who to, you know, who to talk to and what we were looking for. The first time this, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1112.56s)]
*  using the RFP Navigator was extremely useful in comparing. I really had no idea how this whole [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1119.68s)]
*  thing went through. And that platform really helped. The second time, I can't say it was as [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1125.6s)]
*  helpful for me because we sort of had our criteria set up. I knew what I was looking for, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1131.36s)]
*  but it still made it much simpler. But having some, you know, the outside guidance, if you don't [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1137.4399999999998s)]
*  know anything about the CDMO world and the contracting and the pitfalls and what's this, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1143.36s)]
*  particularly these change orders and what that's going to involve and why one cheap, you know, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1149.76s)]
*  low price contract may be the most expensive one. That is something you really have to know about. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1154.64s)]
*  And innocent people like me are not going to know that. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1162.24s)]
*  Yeah. Can I jump in there real fast? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  No, no, Steve. No, I'm just kidding. Steve's, you know, this is where Steve comes in and he says, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1168.3200000000002s)]
*  well, you know, all an emerging biotech exec needs to know is, you know, skip the RFP Navigator [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1176.0s)]
*  application and come give Abby and I a visit. That would be great. I mean, but there's a couple [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1183.6s)]
*  of nuggets in there that Andy really threw out that are like the key to, I don't care what company [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1191.28s)]
*  it is that's looking for a CDMO partner that you need to be aware of. And you should be looking [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1198.24s)]
*  for as a, you know, early on, early on biotech or someone searching for a CDMO partner. The first is [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1204.1599999999999s)]
*  the details in the proposal are critical. And, you know, sitting down with Andy, you know, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1211.28s)]
*  we probably had five sit downs together where we talked about what he was looking for, you know, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1217.28s)]
*  what his program needed, talked directly to his scientists about what the program required. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1224.08s)]
*  And that really gives us, you know, a special understanding of exactly what they need in their [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1230.0s)]
*  proposal so that we're not looking at, you know, multiple, multiple change orders. It's very easy [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1235.68s)]
*  to throw a proposal out there and just basically say, okay, yeah, we're going to do your program [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1240.72s)]
*  for X dollars. Because once Andy signs up, then he's really on the hook and I can change order, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1244.4s)]
*  change order, change order to the point where I put him out of business. Right. Yeah. The key is [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1249.76s)]
*  understand upfront. And that is critical that then feeds into the RFP Navigator. Right. So, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1254.8s)]
*  so I would say that, you know, any small biotech that's looking to do a CDMO partnership [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1261.28s)]
*  early on work and the person that's listening to you as a, as a potential business partner [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1266.88s)]
*  is really critical to them as a CDMO, a CDMO relationship with their, with their business. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1273.1200000000001s)]
*  And we're supposed to, second point is we're supposed to be a consultant, right? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1281.8400000000001s)]
*  We are not, we are not there to dictate to Andy what he should do with his program. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1286.88s)]
*  We're going to guide him and what's best for his program based on our experience and what we think [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1292.08s)]
*  is going to get his program to the end point, which is GMP material, you know, but at the end [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1298.24s)]
*  of the day, he owns the program, his scientists own the program. It's his business. We're there [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1303.52s)]
*  as their manufacturing partner. So we can make recommendations at the end of the day, it's his [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  decision. So, or the decision of the business. And I think those two things are critical [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1317.36s)]
*  so that they can be, you know, as successful as possible when it comes to selecting their CDMO [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1323.76s)]
*  partner and then getting material out for their, whatever phase clinical trial that they're doing. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1329.4399999999998s)]
*  So thanks for those nuggets Andy, cause that's, that's the key point. Well, you did use that word [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1335.36s)]
*  that you're, you're not just the CDMO, you also act as a consultant and this kind of advice, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1341.52s)]
*  you know, and being, and it is extremely useful to, you know, people at our stage who really don't [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1347.52s)]
*  have much that much of a team, we rely on outside people for this and, you know, feeling like [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1353.76s)]
*  we are a major client, even though we're very small is important and feeling like, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1362.56s)]
*  yeah, I can call you up and ask for advice and suggestions. And it's not just about how you're [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1368.72s)]
*  going to make more money off of us. That's right. What is the, what does the day to day or week to [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1374.72s)]
*  week sort of cadence of, of, of communication, business communication, Andy, I'm not talking [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1382.32s)]
*  about the joke of the day. We got, I was going to say that's the number one communication. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1387.9199999999998s)]
*  Beyond the joke of the day. What, what, you know, what's the expectation in terms of, you know, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1392.96s)]
*  Steve, you just mentioned like, you know, we could change order FINA to death. You know, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1396.48s)]
*  when situations arise where communication is, is necessary, what does that look like versus like, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1402.32s)]
*  is there a regular cadence of, you know, weekly or biweekly or monthly or quarterly meetings where [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1407.28s)]
*  you're just touching base and making sure that everyone's paddling in the same direction? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1413.52s)]
*  What, what, what's that look like? We have, yeah, we have biweekly technical meetings [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1417.1200000000001s)]
*  and I think we have, I think it's biweekly management meeting. So looking at the overall [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1424.88s)]
*  program and then in between, we have additional questions going back and forth. So we're looking [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1433.6000000000001s)]
*  at, at additional data as it gets generated before the actual meeting and we get, get the, the slides [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1441.68s)]
*  you know, ahead of the meeting so that we can review and prepare for, for the questions. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1449.68s)]
*  This, you know, our process is not an academic process that we're tossing over to a, you know, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1455.36s)]
*  phase one GMP manufacturer because it's our, our, our product has already been made GMP. It's already [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1460.3999999999999s)]
*  been in clinic. It's into clinical phase one conjugate vaccines. We have a pretty good handle [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1467.12s)]
*  on the product and it's, it is not like a, it's not functional in the sense of an enzyme or an [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1474.0s)]
*  antibody where it has to have, it's a protein. So it's, in that sense, it's simpler than, you know, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1482.08s)]
*  some other projects. It's, but our, the protein is also very finicky and that, that's the challenge [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1489.6s)]
*  of, of manufacturing it. When those challenges arise, what's the, what's the protocol for [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1496.88s)]
*  addressing them? Like telecom, we, we have, we have the Zoom calls and, and, and go through it [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1503.04s)]
*  also can just directly call up through, generally we're going to go through their project manager, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1511.12s)]
*  but, but speak with the technical person. Yeah, I think it's, it's also important that, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1516.56s)]
*  you know, there's, there's a primary point of contact, right? And that primary point of contact [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1522.8s)]
*  is their project manager. Yeah. Own everything as it relates to the program. Everything gets [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1527.76s)]
*  through them, but Andy has a direct line to me as well. So, you know, there's always going to be [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1532.56s)]
*  something in a program that comes up that's unexpected and Andy has to feel comfortable [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1538.16s)]
*  enough to call me and say, Hey, did you hear about this and how are we handling that? And, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1543.36s)]
*  and we're all to make sure we're all kind of lockstep and getting his program to the end [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1549.84s)]
*  point. So yeah, that's, those are all kind of open doors and, you know, clear lines of communication [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1554.56s)]
*  about what we need to do in order to get his anything moving in the right direction. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1561.68s)]
*  I'm going to come back to the, the marketing budget and the dinners. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1568.0s)]
*  Getting to know the people is, is really important when you just, I mean, Zoom does help, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1573.6000000000001s)]
*  but really there's nothing like spending hours, you know, at a, at an event, talking to somebody [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1579.3600000000001s)]
*  that really helps. And, and we're, you know, we're not able to get to, to Texas now to go [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1586.56s)]
*  visit Scorpius, but that is high on my list of things to do to, to meet with the people in, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1593.6799999999998s)]
*  in person. You know, it's, yeah, it's good to know the personalities of the people and, and they're, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1598.48s)]
*  you know, some of the, so the face-to-face meetings are, are important. That is something [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1604.1599999999999s)]
*  that we haven't gotten to, but that does relate to another reason why we picked Scorpius. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1609.12s)]
*  The other lead contender was Northern European. And it's just, you know, sending things back and [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1615.44s)]
*  forth, the time difference was all going to create issues for us. Very easy for us to ship [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1624.16s)]
*  material back and forth because we're, you know, we're making the material at essentially the same [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1631.04s)]
*  level in our own lab. Just as, you know, we're doing the five liter scale, not, not the larger [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1637.92s)]
*  that we're mimicking stuff. So material can go back and forth for us to evaluate and for them [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1646.0800000000002s)]
*  to evaluate. So to speed things up, for example, while they were doing, before they got to the [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1652.64s)]
*  fermentation, we sent paste that they could use for downstream processing and to start that in [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1658.3200000000002s)]
*  order to speed things up. So things didn't have to be done entirely in a linear fashion. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1664.56s)]
*  I think that would have been harder to do with a, with a overseas manufacturer. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1669.76s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. Steve, I want to get back to something that Andy mentioned when we were [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1674.56s)]
*  talking about sort of the cadence of interaction and communications between the two companies. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1679.04s)]
*  You mentioned, you know, that there are bi-weekly technical meetings and bi-weekly more managerial [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1683.2s)]
*  product level meetings. Is it, you know, full transparency, is it more or less challenging [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1689.84s)]
*  in a relationship with like FINAs where you're probably having both those conversations with [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1698.1599999999999s)]
*  Andy. I get the impression that regardless of what level the conversation is on, you know, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1705.28s)]
*  like that batch, that product, that long-term strategy, Andy's probably the center of that [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1711.36s)]
*  conversation. He wears multiple hats, right? He's the person that sells you the ticket and gets you [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1719.28s)]
*  on the train at the same time and then drives the train, right? So, yeah, so it's definitely a [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1725.6s)]
*  different level of conversation, right? And I think there is a clear separation. So, you know, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1730.96s)]
*  Andy does a pretty good job of wearing the hat at the time. And I think he knows that I'm not the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1736.24s)]
*  scientist on the calls. So he definitely dumps it down whenever he and I have a discussion. And [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1741.92s)]
*  it's more about, you know, kind of the meat and potatoes of what he's trying to get across. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1748.24s)]
*  He doesn't go on about conjugated vaccines and what I need to do in order to help in that matter. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1753.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're more on the business side. I have a technical degree, but by no means am I at the [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1759.44s)]
*  level of the scientists that are at Scorpio. So, yeah, so he, you know, I think making sure that [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1764.48s)]
*  we direct the conversation to the right folks, if it starts to get a little bit too technical, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1772.32s)]
*  I'll pull on the strings of the people that need to get involved in that. But yeah, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1777.44s)]
*  I'm there for the business side and support. Never do I want to be the person that is directing or [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1781.04s)]
*  guiding this program. We're going to rely on the experts to do that. And yeah, those are the guys [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1787.6s)]
*  and the gals at San Antonio for sure. On our end, I can't manage this kind of project. We have someone [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1793.52s)]
*  who's really good on details and staying on top of stuff. I'm not much of a detailed person. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1800.8s)]
*  And we have someone who met on our end, who's the project manager, keeps track of all of our [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1807.44s)]
*  paperwork, all of the communications. And I think that's really important. And then, you know, on [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1812.96s)]
*  the technical side, we have Natalia, the scientist who developed this, the whole process, and she's [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1818.3999999999999s)]
*  the one who really supervises the technical stuff. But for example, you know, we're looking at the [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1827.04s)]
*  tech transfer, and we know we're going to make another change in the process. So there's no point [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1833.6s)]
*  in trying to get the tech transfer perfect, knowing that we're going to make changes down the road [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1840.6399999999999s)]
*  to something that's going to affect that anyway. So we know the process has been transferred. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1847.68s)]
*  And, you know, now we can, so my decision was, let's not make it perfect [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1853.3600000000001s)]
*  at this stage. Let's get to the next phase, and then we can worry about the subsequent part. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1858.0800000000002s)]
*  So there is, you know, there is the certainly the business part of managing [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1866.24s)]
*  the work, the kind of the money workflow, what's going to, when things are going to happen. So we, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1873.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, we know when we need, think we're going to need the material, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1880.0800000000002s)]
*  but we, and we want to make sure that we have the money in place to get there. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1885.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's an interesting point, like, you know, when you when you'll need the material, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1889.68s)]
*  and then obviously that material is being produced for use in potentially another facility, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1895.52s)]
*  definitely by another company, a relationship like this, it strikes me that there are probably [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1902.3200000000002s)]
*  multiple opportunities for third parties, fourth parties, fifth parties, right, to have their, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1907.76s)]
*  if not in real time, to have their tentacles sort of intertwined down the road to. So which can be, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1915.6s)]
*  I mean, from your perspective, Steve, that could be a gold mine down the road, right? Like that [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1923.92s)]
*  could be at least, let's say pragmatically that it could open up some new opportunities for Scorpius. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1930.4s)]
*  But in the short term, it can also introduce complications. So tell me a little bit about [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1935.76s)]
*  that, like, to the degree that you can talk about, like, what sort of third party elements are [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1939.76s)]
*  involved, third party and beyond, and how it's managed. Yeah, there's always third party [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1944.8s)]
*  relationships that are ongoing with programs because, you know, regardless of whether you're [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1949.6s)]
*  considered a one-stop shop CDMO, you're always going to rely on some kind of third party work, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1956.0s)]
*  whether it's third party testing, maybe you don't do drug product filling, maybe you don't do [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1960.8s)]
*  clinical packaging. And in those cases, the best thing again for me is to advise Andy on who he [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1967.28s)]
*  should potentially go with that might be a good fit for his program, right? There's a bunch out there. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1975.28s)]
*  Again, Andy's going to run into those situations where he doesn't know necessarily who to work [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1981.04s)]
*  with or maybe he doesn't have experience. But, you know, my ears on the ground as it relates to those [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1984.96s)]
*  relationships and the capabilities of other, you know, I guess what I would call contract [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1991.44s)]
*  manufacturers, but not necessarily on the on the GMP drug substance side. So I could make those [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=1997.28s)]
*  connections for Andy. I can say, hey, Andy, these are the folks you want to talk to. I can certainly [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2004.24s)]
*  do it on their behalf and essentially continue to manage that with our project management. It [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2011.04s)]
*  really depends on how Andy wants that relationship to look. So, you know, we can kind of craft it. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2018.8s)]
*  However, Andy wants that to be handled. Sometimes they, you know, companies don't necessarily want [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2026.0s)]
*  the CDMOTIS to handle clinical packaging and distribution. But if they want us to handle it [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2034.3999999999999s)]
*  and they want us to be kind of that conduit between the clinical packaging business, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2040.08s)]
*  we're happy to do those kind of things. So it's really kind of it's really all a card. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2045.52s)]
*  Whatever he wants to do, we'll do it for him. I would say on the other end, you know, one of the [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2051.12s)]
*  we would as we discussed before, I'm a magician. So part of that, you know, performing is I like [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2057.28s)]
*  to make other people happy. I like to help other people. And, you know, I almost became a technical [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2063.7599999999998s)]
*  sales rep and the idea of going around and helping people with their problems. I like when people [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2071.6s)]
*  come to the lab, I like to have a network of people. And in the same way, and that's why I'm, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2077.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, happy to be on programs like this. I like to work with other people. And what I found is, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2084.0s)]
*  as I've run my company, we're not trying not to be transactional, try to make it relationship based. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2091.92s)]
*  And, you know, so somebody will come around and maybe I don't need their product, but I can refer [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2098.96s)]
*  them somewhere else, I can help them. And I've made a new friend. And in the same way, you know, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2105.6s)]
*  Scorpius has really been helping me and reaching out to other people and other companies. And, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2111.36s)]
*  you know, I'm able to bring in referrals to Scorpius. And, you know, some of them, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2118.48s)]
*  they can't do, but it's still bringing in business and helping to get their name out there. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2127.04s)]
*  And, you know, so it's really, you know, helping other people is how you help yourself is kind of [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2132.88s)]
*  the philosophy. Yeah. And Andy has done that. He has done a really good job of promoting [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2139.92s)]
*  our relationship. And it's definitely, we've definitely seen the benefits from it. So we [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2146.32s)]
*  much appreciate it. Yeah, that's fantastic. I want to be respectful of your time. I know we're [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2151.76s)]
*  kind of running short here, but I've got a few last questions for you. One would be, I mean, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2158.0s)]
*  you know, I could go long. Andy, you were just talking about the relationship and the people, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2163.6800000000003s)]
*  and I appreciate that, man. I love that. Like, I love to hear about that, you know, the soft stuff. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2167.76s)]
*  At the same time, you know, like I think about like, I think about experiences that I've had [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2174.8s)]
*  being, you know, in business with family that have gone awry, right? Like things that things, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2181.44s)]
*  it doesn't always go well. When you care about the person you're doing business with, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2188.56s)]
*  sometimes those relationships do not juxtapose cleanly. So how do like, let's talk about [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2192.1600000000003s)]
*  expectations and measurables. Like, how do you keep the business part business and sort of chart [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2202.16s)]
*  the measurables and the expectations and work toward them, right? We have a deliverable product. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2209.2799999999997s)]
*  We need some, you know, we need the GMP material. We're going to end up with a bunch of protein that [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2216.24s)]
*  meets specs in little vials. That's the bottom line. So all the nice stuff and the jokes [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2221.12s)]
*  are just part of getting there. And, and, but yeah, but in the end, it's a business and we need to do [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2228.7200000000003s)]
*  this. It's a lot of money and we need to have a product at the end. Yeah. And it's early. Oh, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2238.6400000000003s)]
*  Steve, go ahead. Go ahead. I was going to say, and there's definitely been, you know, scenarios that, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2244.8s)]
*  you know, Andy and I have a great, you know, personal relationship, but there's also the point [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2249.76s)]
*  where we need to talk business, right? And on both sides. And we've had that, you know, we've had very [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2253.92s)]
*  good discussions. It's, it's, we're going to solve those things. And there's definitely a line between, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2259.92s)]
*  you know, business and pleasure, you know, happy to go out and have a drink. We're happy to go out [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2267.44s)]
*  and have dinner, but we got to make sure that we deliver. And he has expectations from us as well, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2271.28s)]
*  that we need to make sure that he's, he's attending to. So, you know, we've had those good conversations [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2276.6400000000003s)]
*  as well. Healthy business relationship. Yeah. You know, running a small business, you know, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2282.32s)]
*  and particularly when there's no investors involved and there's no pot of money anywhere, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2289.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, that cash flow is critical. And so working with Steve on, on managing that and [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2293.52s)]
*  expectations on both sides, I've made certain promises I'm going to deliver [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2299.6800000000003s)]
*  by the end of the year and it's going to happen. Yeah. Yeah. You know, the way I pose the question [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2305.44s)]
*  I mentioned that I had Jenny Holt on from Ray Therapeutics. She's a chief business officer there. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2313.12s)]
*  So she's, you know, she's answering to Paul Bresge, the president CEO of Ray Therapeutics and a board, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2319.2s)]
*  right? Like these are things, these are nuances that you don't need to deal with Andy because [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2326.3199999999997s)]
*  of your position. But the way I, the way I posed the question to her was I said, you know, Jenny, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2331.04s)]
*  if Paul and the board were to come into your office right now, like as you and I are speaking [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2335.9199999999996s)]
*  and say, like, you need to rationalize in clear terms, the money that we're spending on our [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2340.24s)]
*  relationship with Forge Biologics, how would you do it? And, you know, she gave me a really good, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2346.24s)]
*  really good response to that, but you, you, you, Andy, don't, you don't necessarily need to [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2350.9599999999996s)]
*  rationalize it to a, to a board or to your boss, but you have to, you have to be able to sleep at [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2355.52s)]
*  night and, and, you know, sleep at night. I think you answered the question. I don't have to rationalize [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2360.56s)]
*  it. I have to rationalize it to myself in the middle of the night. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2365.52s)]
*  You know, where this is going to come from, because this, it's definitely, you know, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2370.0s)]
*  this is a major undertaking for a company that does not have outside funding. But, you know, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2373.8399999999997s)]
*  it's moving forward. We have the resources to do this. You guys have to rationalize it to his wife, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2380.7999999999997s)]
*  though. That too. Yes. That's an omnipresent challenge for all of us married men. I understand [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2386.48s)]
*  that one completely. You know, one of the, one of the conversations I frequently have with, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2392.4s)]
*  with sponsors about outsourced, outsourcing relationships is just, you were talking about [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2398.1600000000003s)]
*  tech transfer a few minutes ago, Andy, and I frequently heard, you know, conversation with, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2404.08s)]
*  with biotech execs around just how low they are to, to make a change, to go through that process [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2412.88s)]
*  again, which, which you guys did. And Andy, obviously it was an inflection point for the [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2419.6s)]
*  company. You needed more capacity. So it probably made sense, but I guess the, the dark side of this [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2422.96s)]
*  question, Andy, would be what would, what would be considered cause for change? What, what could [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2428.72s)]
*  Scorpius possibly do to screw things up? How could they screw up? We're still in the honeymoon phase. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2435.6s)]
*  I know. We're not, we're not, we're not, we haven't gotten to the assigning of the blame yet. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2441.36s)]
*  And I'm coming at you with such a downer. Yeah, we really, I mean, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2446.64s)]
*  we would, I, at this point, I really can't think what would change. I mean, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2453.12s)]
*  how about I can, I can answer that because if we can't deliver, then Andy needs to find someone [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2456.8s)]
*  who can. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that is, you know, and that is our expectation is to deliver the [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2463.04s)]
*  product that we told Andy we would. Right. That is what he should expect from us. And if we can't [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2471.12s)]
*  deliver, then he needs to take his program somewhere that somebody can. And that is the [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2477.04s)]
*  expectation of anyone who has a CDMO partner. You need to have material when you, when you need it, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2483.7599999999998s)]
*  you need to get material when you need it. And the promises need to be kept. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2490.64s)]
*  And I mean, that's the deliver. We've, we believe, I believe Scorpius can deliver this. I mean, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2494.48s)]
*  we obviously wouldn't have selected that. You don't get married with the expectation of getting [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2499.36s)]
*  divorced. And, and I, you know, we're going to do everything that we can to make this work. And I, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  I have no reason to believe otherwise on based on anything that I've, that I've seen of any of [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2511.44s)]
*  our interactions. I've been really happy with it, with the meetings and how things are, are going [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2516.1600000000003s)]
*  with it, with, with Scorpius. Yeah. You shouldn't, you should never settle, right? You should have [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2522.08s)]
*  high expectations and those expectations should be met from your partnership. Yeah. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2527.6s)]
*  I will say I've been involved in several tech transfers now for both as part of phenobio, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2532.7999999999997s)]
*  because we, we transfer conjugation processes to GMP facilities. There is always, you know, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2538.7999999999997s)]
*  it's you're working, you spent years working on this process and then to essentially throw it over [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2545.92s)]
*  a bunch of paper over the, over the fence and expect that it's going to be [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2552.48s)]
*  duplicated exactly is, is unrealistic. So you really need to be working with this, with the CDMO, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2556.72s)]
*  you know, depending on your, on your level here, we, we've got batch records, GMP batch records [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2567.52s)]
*  to transfer. We know the process works. So it's a little bit different than an academic who's, yes, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2573.36s)]
*  it worked in a lab and now here, now just make it bigger. That never works. Yeah. That is the, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2581.76s)]
*  the classic mistake, you know, we'll, we'll do. And I sort of learned that the hard way is projects [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2588.6400000000003s)]
*  come into us. Yeah. So really it's, it's, you know, understanding that it's not, it's not going to go [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2597.36s)]
*  perfect. It's, it's, I mean, humans make mistakes. It's how you address those mistakes. That's, that's [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2605.0400000000004s)]
*  key. And, and I see Scorpius, you know, being willing to do this. One of the CDMOs I worked in [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2610.48s)]
*  the distant past, you know, it was, this is the way we do things, you know, so when you give them [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2618.16s)]
*  the process to improve it, they, they know what they've done and they won't recognize there's a [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2623.04s)]
*  reason you ended up with this, you know, with this step. Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned recognizing [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2628.48s)]
*  mistakes and, and it's just solid advice. It's not, it's not the mistakes you make, but, but how [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2637.04s)]
*  you deal with, with them. And I know, again, it's early in the relationship, but at this stage in [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2642.24s)]
*  the relationship, looking back on the, you know, the, the contracting process, the MSAs, the [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2648.08s)]
*  expectations that have been, that have been forged. What, what, what would you, either of you do [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2653.36s)]
*  differently if you, if you had a redo, you know, was there, has there been a step in the process [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2658.4s)]
*  so far? You were like, yeah, we probably could have handled that a little bit better. I'd probably [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2662.48s)]
*  ask for less daily jokes from Andy, but that's really, all right. You're off the list. I was [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2666.48s)]
*  actually, I was actually, sometimes I get more than one daily joke, so it doesn't necessarily mean [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2672.0s)]
*  it's a daily joke. It's, it's a second daily joke. Yeah. Well, sometimes I, Matt, I miss the meetings [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2678.16s)]
*  because I have to go to my kleptomaniacs anonymous meeting meetings. And, you know, I take something [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2684.88s)]
*  away from every session. I got, that's very good. Is that exemplary of the day? I was going to [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2691.76s)]
*  actually ask where, where I could subscribe to Andy Lee's daily, daily jokes. It's really a private, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2698.8s)]
*  private, private list. That's probably a good thing because if that, if that, if that joke you [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2705.0400000000004s)]
*  just made is exemplary. That's the better one. Yeah. Yeah. I'm out. I'm out. Some of them are, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2709.5200000000004s)]
*  some of them are a little better than others. Yeah. We go with volume, not quality. It's, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2714.96s)]
*  that's right. I love it. If I had to change, if I had to change anything, you know, I, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2720.7999999999997s)]
*  I think that I would have, I would have loved to get to Andy earlier because, you know, the sooner [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2729.36s)]
*  you can get to someone that helps them, you know, create their program and get it on a better pathway [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2735.92s)]
*  faster. You know, like I said, I had been doing this for a while and had come from large CDMO [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2742.48s)]
*  and I think that consultative opportunity for me to kind of give Andy guidance on what I would [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2749.6s)]
*  do if I were into his shoes. I personally like to do those kinds of things. So especially for [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2756.2400000000002s)]
*  someone like Andy. So, you know, unfortunately I can't turn the, I can't turn back the clock. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2762.6400000000003s)]
*  So I mean, we really started this project pretty much with Scorpius really starting up. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2768.8s)]
*  And so, you know, we've, it's about as early on as we could have gotten. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2773.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, we're, you know, they're not that many companies doing this kind of thing that are still, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2778.16s)]
*  you know, solely owned by one person. And this is not the only, only, you know, we also are [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2783.44s)]
*  starting a company around our E. coli strain that can make all kinds of other interesting proteins. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2789.92s)]
*  And so that's, you know, that's the challenge. We still run our, we have our conjugation services [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2796.4s)]
*  business. And then early on recognizing all this stuff takes time to make money. We also [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2801.6s)]
*  sell polymer based diagnostic reagents. So based on, on conjugation. So we, we supply [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2808.56s)]
*  modified dextran polymers for research and for, you know, commercial products. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2817.7599999999998s)]
*  And so we take our expertise in that. So all these to, to make what we think are the best, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2825.52s)]
*  best products in this. So we really have four business areas. The carrier proteins for conjugate [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2830.64s)]
*  vaccines is just one of them. And so keeping all these things in the air as a one, you know, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2837.36s)]
*  as a one, one person running four businesses, essentially is a challenge. And so having, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2844.56s)]
*  you know, really reliable help outside help is key to making all this work. And I'd say the, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLSkbcI1xiA&t=2850.32s)]
