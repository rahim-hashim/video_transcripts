Video Description: When it comes to landing and executing strategic partnerships, Regeneron puts on a clinic. Partnerships, acquisitions, licensing agreements, and other deals large and small with Intellia, Decibel Therapeutics, BARDA, Alnylam, and Sonoma Therapeutics are just a sampling of those making news this year alone. The man behind much of that dealmaking is none other than Nouhad Husseini, SVP and Head of Business Development and Corporate Strategy at Regeneron. He’s a guy who’s deftly married the art and science of biopharma dealmaking, and on this episode of the Business of Biotech podcast, we’re getting introspective with this legend in the making, who our friend Allan Shaw says “turns the deals he touches into gold.” Strategic dealmaking is central to the biotech business, and today’s episode offers a master class.

# Biotech Dealmaking with Regeneron's Nouhad Husseini
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo)
*  The business of biotech is produced by LifeScience Connect and its community of learning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=0.0s)]
*  solving, and sourcing resources for biopharma decision makers. If you're working on biologics [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=5.2s)]
*  process development and manufacturing challenges, you need to swing by bioprocessonline.com. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=11.44s)]
*  If you're trying to stay ahead of the cell or gene therapy curve, visit cellandgene.com. When it's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=17.12s)]
*  time to map out your clinical course, let clinicalleader.com help. And if optimizing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=22.72s)]
*  outsourcing decisions is what you're after, check out outsourcepharma.com. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=28.4s)]
*  We're LifeScience Connect, and we're here to help. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  When my buddy Alan Shaw says, hey, there's someone you should have on your show, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=40.08s)]
*  he gets my attention because he's usually right about this business of biotech stuff. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  When he says this guy turns stuff he touches into gold, I'll admit I get a little skeptical, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=49.36s)]
*  but then again, Alan's never given me a bum steer. I'm Matt Piller. This is the business [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=54.08s)]
*  of biotech, and I'm pretty sure I've already made today's guest a little uncomfortable, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=58.64s)]
*  but Newhad Husseini deserves that high praise. As SVP and head of business development and corporate [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  strategy at Regeneron, he's established and orchestrated a pretty solid record of winning [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=70.24s)]
*  strategic collaborations and licensing deals. On today's episode, we're going to get to know Newhad [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=75.28s)]
*  and we're going to learn as much as we can about strategic partnership success [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=81.36s)]
*  in biopharma. Newhad, welcome to the show. Thanks a lot. Thanks for having me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=85.6s)]
*  Nothing like putting you on a pedestal from the outset, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=90.8s)]
*  Well, yeah, turning things into gold. That's about as high a bar as you can strive for. Yeah, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=93.76s)]
*  I'm still trying to do that, but I'm capable of that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=97.68s)]
*  Yeah. Well, like I said, Alan speaks super highly of you, and I trust his word. So I want to begin [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=102.88s)]
*  by getting to know your pedigree, your background a little bit, and sort of the mix that set you up [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=108.96s)]
*  for the position you're in today and the work that you're doing. And if I go back to college, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  your college years, you graduated from Princeton with a BA in molecular biology, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=121.6s)]
*  and then made the transition into investment banking and equity research at Robertson Stevens [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=127.6s)]
*  and Morgan Stanley. So whenever I see that sort of transition from a sciencey sort of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=133.04s)]
*  undergrad or academia into investment banking or equities, it makes me curious about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=141.04s)]
*  sort of where your head was at during that time, what your strategic sort of approach was. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I guess I wish I was more strategic back in those days. There was no strategy involved here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  It was when I was whatever, 18 or so, kind of starting my world in molecular biology, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=160.88s)]
*  I didn't really know anything else. I thought I was going to grow up to be a scientist. That was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=167.68s)]
*  just kind of what I did and what I liked doing. And I was planning to go to a PhD program or [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=171.44s)]
*  maybe an MD PhD or something like this. And it was, I think, in my junior year, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=177.28s)]
*  we had to spend a year in the lab really kind of getting our hands dirty with a full-on thesis [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=184.48s)]
*  project that eventually we'd try to publish. And it was like a legitimate research endeavor [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=190.0s)]
*  partnering with one of the faculty members at the university. And that was a disaster on many [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  levels. One, I learned that I just really wasn't very good at the practice of science as much as [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=203.04s)]
*  I loved it. And I actually didn't really enjoy the laboratory experience, just in terms of the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=208.88s)]
*  individual nature, or at least the way I kind of, it wasn't very much of a team sport. You know, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  I would go into the lab and set up my experiments, wait a couple of days, cross my fingers, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=218.48s)]
*  hope they worked. You know, usually they didn't, I'd have to repeat them. And I found that process [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=222.88s)]
*  to be a little demoralizing and not very rewarding. So it was kind of an, oh crap, kind of moment. Now, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=227.6s)]
*  what am I going to do with myself that this isn't the path that I thought I was going to be on? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  And then I kind of figured out, okay, what am I going to do next? And a lot of my friends, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  a lot of my classmates had kind of run off to Wall Street, which was not atypical for kind of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=243.2s)]
*  Ivy league undergrads to just go do that for a couple of years. And so I figured, what the hell, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=247.68s)]
*  I'll give that a try. Actually Alan Shaw, one of his friends, a guy named Mark Simon, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=251.84s)]
*  it was a well-known person in the biopharma, one of the early, early bankers and researchers in the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  field back in the nineties. Maybe you know, Mark, he had hired me, you know, and kind of took a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=263.76s)]
*  chance on someone with literally no business experience, just as someone who was hungry and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=270.24s)]
*  wanted to learn. So he, I was lucky enough to get that opportunity to kind of co-work with Mark and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=275.12s)]
*  his team at Roberts and Stevens. And back in 2000, when this all happened, you know, these were the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=280.08s)]
*  days when biotech was kind of booming around the sequencing of the human genome. And it was just a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  really exciting time. Companies were raising lots of money and it was just, it was a great time for [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=290.56s)]
*  me to kind of enter the field and just start drinking from the fire hose, as they say. That's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=295.6s)]
*  kind of how I ended up there. That's great. You made it, you know, you made it through those labs [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=300.72s)]
*  further than I did when I was in my undergrad. I was, I think it was my freshman year, I was [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  undeclared, you know, undecided. And I was taking a class called anatomical physiology, a very, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=311.36s)]
*  very basic sort of anatomy class. And there was a lab for that class. It was when they wield the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=316.56s)]
*  cadaver in for that lab that I said, no, no, sciences are not for me. I'm not going to go [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=322.48s)]
*  that route. Do you find yourself in, and especially like early on, like when you got into the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=328.56s)]
*  investment scene, did you find yourself leaning at all into your molecular biology background or [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=336.72s)]
*  knowledge or did you find that advantageous having that background? Yeah, I mean, it has [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=343.68s)]
*  proven advantageous for sure. But I mean, early on in my career, you know, I was, could not be more [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=350.24s)]
*  green, you know, in terms of just understanding business, finance, and even just the industry. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=355.84s)]
*  I mean, you know, what you learn in the lab about how enzymes work and DNA and biochemistry of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=360.32s)]
*  amino acids, et cetera, you know, just that has no applicability to the world of clinical trials [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=366.4s)]
*  and the FDA and intellectual property and, you know, Medicare reimbursement dynamics and J codes, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=372.23999999999995s)]
*  all these things that, you know, drive stocks of publicly traded companies. And so that was, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=380.0s)]
*  you know, a just crazy learning experience. You know, as I've gone through my career, for sure, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=385.52s)]
*  you know, that foundation, I've kind of looked back on that and, you know, it gives me the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=390.96s)]
*  vocabulary and the basic understanding of why I can kind of ask intelligent questions about mechanisms [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=395.28s)]
*  of action and areas of science and target biology. You know, it gives me the ability to ask better [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=401.28s)]
*  questions and understand the answers. I'm by no means an expert, but it's, it's been a big [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=406.64s)]
*  advantage, I think, over the years. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=410.8s)]
*  Tanner Iskra When you, when you added a Wharton MBA in 2004, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=412.16s)]
*  at that point, was there, I guess, a little more intentionality behind where Newhad wanted to take [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=418.16s)]
*  his career? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  Dr. David P. Olson A little bit, but not really. I mean, to be honest, I mean, I, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  I was still at a crossroads of, you know, do I stay in, you know, like financial services or [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=429.92s)]
*  investing, right? That was kind of, I was at this moment, I could go work at a hedge fund. And I [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=435.92s)]
*  just thought that was like, that was pretty exciting because, you know, you, I'm sure you [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=439.92s)]
*  meet a lot of these folks. I mean, these are the kind of the smartest of the smart in terms of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=443.68s)]
*  people that are in our industry, just incredibly bright, high energy people. And I just was amazed [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=447.12s)]
*  by these people as a young professional and wanted to be part of that. And so I thought maybe that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=451.68s)]
*  was a path I might just continue down because that's kind of where I started. But then there [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=456.8s)]
*  was a big part of me that wanted to be part of a mission driven, more of a team, you know, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=460.56s)]
*  building something, building an organization. And I wanted to at least have that experience and give [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=465.12s)]
*  that a shot. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay area. And, you know, as a kid, you know, even then [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=469.68s)]
*  I kind of knew of Genentech, you know, partly because some of my, my friends, their parents [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=476.32s)]
*  worked at Genentech. It was a kind of a known entity, at least in my sphere. And I always [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  thought of Genentech as like this, you know, amazing place, the pinnacle of really biotech, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=485.92s)]
*  which it was in a lot of ways in the nineties and early two thousands. And so I kind of had that in [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=491.2s)]
*  my head. You know, when I went to warden, I had this goal. I said, oh, right. I'm going to Genentech [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=496.08s)]
*  after warden. That's the reason I'm signing up for warden. So let's see if that works out. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  And I actually applied for an internship that summer at Genentech and got denied. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God, this whole reason I went to work and to end up at Genentech, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=511.2s)]
*  this may not happen. I ended up at Amgen over that summer and had a good experience there. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=514.56s)]
*  And fortunately, when I graduated, I just kind of sat out putting all my cards on the table. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=520.16s)]
*  I'm applying to Genentech and only Genentech, please give me an offer. And fortunately I did. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=523.68s)]
*  And I did end up back in California after school. So that was really the only intentionality to it [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  was to kind of pivot into industry and specifically at Genentech. Yeah. What did you want to like, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=536.0s)]
*  at that point, what did you want to do at Genentech? What did you envision yourself [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=543.3599999999999s)]
*  doing when you set foot in there? You know, that's a good question. I didn't even know, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=546.64s)]
*  you know, because I was just ignorant to really what the roles and career paths even were in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=550.16s)]
*  biopharma. I didn't have, I wasn't one of these people that had a lot of mentors, you know, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=556.16s)]
*  at a young age. You know, I didn't know people in industry. My family wasn't part of the industry, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=560.88s)]
*  nothing like that. So I had no clue, you know, even what people did. You know, I didn't know [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=564.8s)]
*  what business development really was. I didn't know what were the different functions within [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=569.28s)]
*  finance. I didn't know really what the difference between marketing and market access and pipeline [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  planning and portfolio planning and all these different functions. So part of my goal, you know, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=577.52s)]
*  when I went in industry was just to expose myself to, you know, what is out there. And that's part [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=582.88s)]
*  of the career advice I give to a lot of now, you know, younger people entering the workforce is [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=588.88s)]
*  take a couple of years and just explore and figure out what you don't even know is there for you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  So I was fortunate enough to be part of a rotational program that Genentech had set up [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=598.16s)]
*  that allowed me to kind of move through a bunch of these different functions. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=603.2s)]
*  And through that experience, I think it quickly kind of realized that business development was [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=607.52s)]
*  really kind of the path I wanted to be on. Almost, you know, it was just, that was one of the few [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=612.8s)]
*  places where a business person like me could be super close to the science and occasionally [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=618.24s)]
*  flex some scientific muscle and, you know, which is what I really wanted. You know, when I was in [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=623.28s)]
*  marketing teams and with in finance teams, sometimes I was feeling like, you know, I could [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=628.08s)]
*  be working at Pepsi and it wouldn't really be all that different, you know, whereas in business [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  development, I'm sitting here back to what I kind of thought about and knew and enjoyed when I was [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=636.32s)]
*  in the equity research world, thinking about science and medicine and trials and data analysis. And, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  you know, that's really kind of got me jazzed up. Yeah. Yeah. And when you think about that stuff, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  you know, in the context of a business development role, you think about it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=653.2s)]
*  I mean, I almost picture it, correct me if I'm wrong here, like, tell me if this is way off base, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  but I almost picture it like from a business debt perspective, when you're studying all those spaces, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  you're looking at all these different parts and pieces like puzzle pieces to determine [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=666.96s)]
*  what might fit within the next steps at your company or the portfolio of your company. Like, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  what's sort of the mindset there? Like, you know, you're, I guess the fact that you were [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=676.8s)]
*  jazzed about the opportunity to look at science and medicine and clinical trials [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=682.8s)]
*  in those early days, what did you learn about, like, to what end? To what end are you doing that? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=688.4s)]
*  I mean, it sounds, I guess, a little cliche, but I mean, I think it was very real and it [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  motivated me and motivated a lot of people was just this feeling of like, hey, you know, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=698.4799999999999s)]
*  this technology, it's probably not going to work, but if it did, man, the impact of being able to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=703.36s)]
*  cure this disease or the impact it's going to have on the world. And while I might play some [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=709.44s)]
*  small part in that, you know, and just that feeling, you know, even though it is a teensy [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=714.24s)]
*  tiny part of like actually seeing something come to the patients, it's still a role in doing [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=718.4s)]
*  something that like has this amazing impact on the world and a lasting impact. So like that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=724.0s)]
*  emotional piece of it and that satisfaction was like really got me excited, you know, just to be [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=729.76s)]
*  in a room and sitting here like, you know, if we're going to cure cancer, right, it's like it might [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=736.72s)]
*  happen in this room. And I'm part of that team, even if in a small way. And it just was that [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=741.28s)]
*  opportunity felt special. Yeah. You developed this, as I said, intentionality to join Genentech, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=746.16s)]
*  to go to Genentech, you made that happen. You're at Genentech. And then in 2011, you [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=756.4s)]
*  joined Regeneron. Was that the transition? Did you go from Genentech to Regeneron in 2011? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=763.6s)]
*  Or was there something in between? Oh, that was it. Yeah. It was it. Yeah. So why did you, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=768.72s)]
*  you know, you wanted so badly to be at Genentech in your formative years. Why did you leave? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, it was not part of the plan, believe me. It was, you know, and also being in San Francisco, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=777.84s)]
*  right? We were there, my wife and I had moved there. We just had our first two children or [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=782.0s)]
*  only two, but they were just born and it was home. And it's like, okay, I'm back in California. This [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=786.08s)]
*  is biotech hotspot. You know, I'm at the greatest company in biotech. Like, why would I ever leave? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=791.2800000000001s)]
*  This is like mission accomplished in terms of my early life goals. You know, but stuff happens, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  right? I mean, it's like, you know, opportunities come your way. And I guess the constellation of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=802.32s)]
*  events that kind of came together, I mean, maybe one of the big ones was the acquisition of [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=806.72s)]
*  Genentech by Roche. So, you know, when that happens, companies change people that I really [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=810.88s)]
*  enjoyed working with leave, you know, culture changes. That's part of that was part of it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=817.28s)]
*  Part of it also was, you know, I had been doing the job for, you know, two or three years as a [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=822.88s)]
*  junior person, learning, learning, learning. And I was ready, you know, just to kind of challenge [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=827.52s)]
*  myself, take that next step, be a bigger fish in a small pond, you know, that kind of thing. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=831.68s)]
*  So I just felt kind of hungry to do more in terms of my own personal role. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=836.16s)]
*  And then there was a personal connection I actually had at Regeneron. A guy I used to work [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=841.92s)]
*  with on Wall Street at Morgan Stanley, a guy by the name of Michael Averman, he had joined Regeneron [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=847.92s)]
*  about a year prior. He had been a successful equity analyst and was one of the very first equity [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=852.48s)]
*  analysts to kind of leave Wall Street to go work for a company. It kind of started a trend. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=858.24s)]
*  He was a trend. But Michael had, I had known him and always had tremendous respect for him. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=862.16s)]
*  And when he reached out and said, hey, we're looking for someone, you know, if it had been [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=867.68s)]
*  someone other than Michael, I probably wouldn't have been so interested. But, you know, you know [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=871.44s)]
*  how things are in life. It's about people. And when Michael reached out, I was like, oh, okay, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=875.2s)]
*  working for you. That's something I would seriously consider doing. And then the last thing I had known [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=879.36s)]
*  Regeneron well, you know, just from covering them as an analyst, I knew the company from afar, at [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=884.24s)]
*  least. And then even within Genentech, there were a couple of interesting moments that kind of always [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=889.92s)]
*  put Regeneron back on my radar screen as like this force to be reckoned with and this potentially, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=894.56s)]
*  you know, super exciting company to be part of. You know, we were sitting in meetings talking about [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=899.5999999999999s)]
*  Lucentis, the retina product from Genentech. And I remember sitting in there and listening to the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=906.4799999999999s)]
*  team. And the team was like, you know, there's this little company called Regeneron with this [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=911.52s)]
*  Vegev trap thing. And we think we should be pretty worried about it because these guys invented a [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=915.28s)]
*  really good molecule and they're doing a good job with the development. So I just put it in my head. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=919.68s)]
*  I'm like, oh, these Regeneron guys, you know, Genentech respects them. And then there was another [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=924.16s)]
*  moment where people were talking about, you know, oh, you know, Genentech wants to get into PCSK9 [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=928.4799999999999s)]
*  and these Regeneron guys, you know, they're leading the way there. I'm like, oh, again, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=934.2399999999999s)]
*  Regeneron again. And then it's antibody technology. Genentech needs to up their game in antibody [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=937.68s)]
*  technology. You know what we should do? Let's call Regeneron because they got Regeneron again. So it [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=942.4799999999999s)]
*  was like in my head that these guys that were Generon were really onto something big. And so [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=946.8s)]
*  that was exciting. Like, can I go to a small company that I thought was just on the verge of some, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=950.8s)]
*  you know, exciting growth? Yeah. And it was. And we're going to get into that next. But before we [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=954.9599999999999s)]
*  do, you mentioned something just a minute ago about sort of this trend of the departure from [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=961.52s)]
*  Wall Street and working in BizDev for a biopharma. Tell me about that transition. Like, what, I don't [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=968.88s)]
*  know, just give us some highlights on sort of the differences and sort of what that transition [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=977.84s)]
*  required and felt like, because you're right. I mean, we see quite a bit of that. And I'm just [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=981.6s)]
*  curious about like the work that you're doing now, you know, how that differs from your time on Wall [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=986.0s)]
*  Street and what you lean into or, you know, take away from that Wall Street experience that serves [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=991.76s)]
*  you well today. I mean, in a lot of ways, it's like the exact same discipline, right? Where, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=998.08s)]
*  you know, you need to look at all these different factors, scientific, business, legal, macro, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1005.0400000000001s)]
*  competitive landscape, synthesize that all together. In one case, it's an investment thesis, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1013.6800000000001s)]
*  right? Do I think I want to invest in the stock and the equity of this company? And the other, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1019.6s)]
*  it's an investment thesis. Do I want to invest in the product and the drug? And so the analysis [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1024.32s)]
*  and the data you look at and the process you go through and the diligence and the modeling, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1029.2s)]
*  like it's really the same discipline in a lot of ways. So that was very comfortable and I could [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1033.6s)]
*  lean on that. And so that gets you to like, you know, the decision point from there. It really [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  diverges a lot. I mean, because then you get into the transaction aspects of it and the dealmaking [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1046.0s)]
*  aspects of it and the negotiation aspects of it, which is a whole other art, you know, that you [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1050.72s)]
*  need to learn and I needed to learn and I'm continuing to learn. I mean, that's one of the [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1057.28s)]
*  fun parts of the job is you never really master that aspect of dealmaking. And it's always a [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1060.56s)]
*  different deal, always a different set of counterparties, different issues come up. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1065.52s)]
*  But that is something that, you know, life in Wall Street cannot and does not prepare you for, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1070.48s)]
*  how to learn that art of the dealmaking and the transaction, you know, technical points. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1076.0s)]
*  Scottie Yeah. Yeah. When you, all right, let me stay there for a minute. When you look at [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1081.84s)]
*  the potential for a deal, we'll use deal. I mean, I'm going to get to the question where I kind of [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1090.6399999999999s)]
*  want to learn your vernacular and I want to learn sort of like what you name the quivers or the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1096.48s)]
*  arrows that is in your quiver. When you're looking at a deal, potential deal, do you like typically [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1101.92s)]
*  treat it sort of as a custom exploratory, let's see where this ends up sort of thing or do you have [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1109.44s)]
*  sort of structured approaches, you know, whether that's a licensing deal or an acquisition or, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1117.04s)]
*  you know, do you go into it with like sort of intentional plans drawing from the tools that, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1125.04s)]
*  I don't know, I'm using a lot of words here, but drawing from the arrows in your quiver [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1132.64s)]
*  that have been, you know, maybe tried and true and proven or is it truly sort of ad hoc, let's [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1136.88s)]
*  see where this ends up and what makes the most sense. For me, it's a pretty sloppy question, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1143.04s)]
*  isn't it? No, I know what you're getting at. I know what you're getting at. At least I think I do. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1150.48s)]
*  Um, for me, it's more, I would say 80-20 of trying to leverage and utilize prior experience, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1155.04s)]
*  knowledge, deal models and apply those versus the like truly let's just sit down and make it up as [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1164.24s)]
*  we go along. I would say that maybe is a non-traditional answer. I think most people in [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1172.0s)]
*  my seat would kind of say, oh no, we do everything bespoke and from, you know, first principles, but [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1176.72s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, there really are certain deals. Again, it all starts with what are you [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1182.16s)]
*  trying to get out of this deal? Right? What are they trying to get out of it? What are we trying [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1185.8400000000001s)]
*  to get out of it? And you can kind of know that, you know, pretty early on and, you know, things fit [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1188.48s)]
*  patterns and we know the type of deal. Like if we're doing a deal to collaborate around, let's run [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  a clinical trial that tests the combination of our PD-1 inhibitor with some novel agent that this [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1198.0s)]
*  company has as an example, you know, we've done 10 of those types of deals. So when you know that's [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1202.8s)]
*  the deal, you kind of know what the issues are and how to make that deal successful. And you want to [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1208.08s)]
*  learn, you know, based on past experiences, like what worked in these prior models and how to [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1212.56s)]
*  optimize that. So that's kind of how I start is like, let me understand what we're trying to get [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1217.04s)]
*  at. And I have a solution for that. And then I try, you know, sometimes that is a shortcoming [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1222.6399999999999s)]
*  of mine. I kind of get stuck in these mental traps of being a little bit too wedded to prior, you [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  know, models. And I always try to step back and say, okay, you know, let's just let that go and [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1233.2s)]
*  let's try something new. Occasionally we've done deals that are fairly unprecedented, you know, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1237.92s)]
*  for the company or just, you know, generally speaking, the industry where we're kind of making [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1244.24s)]
*  things up as we go. Those are fun. You know, I enjoy doing those. Not that I try to avoid that, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1248.56s)]
*  but that just is like a situation when we're really trying to achieve something that's kind of [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1252.96s)]
*  unusual, you know? Yeah. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1257.76s)]
*  Describe Regeneron when you came on the scene, I guess from a business development perspective, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1261.44s)]
*  when you came on scene in 2011, like what did you walk into? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1266.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, I knew what I was walking into, I guess, I think I did, which was a company that [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1271.2s)]
*  really didn't need to do any business development. You know, so it was kind of a strange job to be [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1278.96s)]
*  taking, you know, taking up this head of business development type role where the company wasn't [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1283.84s)]
*  doing any business development. And what I mean by that is that, you know, they had done a really [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1288.32s)]
*  one of a kind type of deal with Santa Fe back, I think it was 2007, which essentially just fully [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1295.52s)]
*  financed the company and its R&D for the next decade, right? Which was highly unusual for a [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1301.6799999999998s)]
*  company at that stage. So there was no more deal making that had to happen to keep the lights on, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1307.6s)]
*  right? Which is what typically small biotechs are doing, selling asset here, you know, they didn't [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1313.2s)]
*  have to do that anymore. So they were kind of done, box checked. Then the other kind of deal was like, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1317.2s)]
*  well, let's buy other people's stuff. Regeneron didn't need to do that because Santa Fe just gave [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1322.0800000000002s)]
*  them billions of dollars to basically turn the crank on the antibody discovery platform, this [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1327.2s)]
*  Velocisuite technology that Regeneron had invented. And so they were more than busy, you know, just [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1331.8400000000001s)]
*  trying to generate clinical candidates and there was no need to bring other stuff in. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1337.76s)]
*  So that was going on. That was just a business reality. And then there was also just more of a [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1343.28s)]
*  cultural reality, which was Regeneron had been around for 25 years. This was not some startup [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1348.24s)]
*  new company and the leadership and many of the employees had been there from the early, early [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1353.92s)]
*  days. So there was this deeply, deeply ingrained culture of how things were done for 20 years. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1359.44s)]
*  And for 20 years, you know, there wasn't a lot of external innovation as like a core part of the [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1365.76s)]
*  strategy. So there was a big need to try to, you know, influence the hearts and minds and open [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1370.8799999999999s)]
*  people's eyes that, hey, guys, we're kind of at a stage now where, yeah, it didn't make sense over [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1378.3999999999999s)]
*  the last 25 years that, you know, that was perfectly appropriate to be laser focused on [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1382.96s)]
*  internal stuff. The companies of all that were getting ready to launch our first major commercial [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1387.44s)]
*  product in ILEA or growing in financial resources, capabilities, clinical resources, our regulatory [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1392.32s)]
*  expertise, you know, everything like we're big boys now, or we're trying to become big boys, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1398.88s)]
*  you know, so we need to change our thinking. And so I kind of walked into that moment of the company [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1403.44s)]
*  and that's kind of what I spent doing the first, you know, two or three years through a lot of just [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1408.72s)]
*  trial and error and exposing people to different companies and banging my head against the wall, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1413.2s)]
*  you know, just trying to get people to see and appreciate, you know, what is even out there, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1418.16s)]
*  right? Because people weren't even really looking, you know, and so as, as people started to be [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  getting more and more exposed to this, and we had a couple of small early wins, you know, it was kind [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1427.84s)]
*  of the experience like, oh, this is actually kind of interesting. I like this. I can see the benefit [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1433.1999999999998s)]
*  of doing more of this stuff. And it just kind of slowly, you know, snowballed slowly, you know, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1436.9599999999998s)]
*  over time until kind of where we are now. What does that motivation look like? I mean, you know, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1443.04s)]
*  you bring up a really good point when you're a small biotech, you know, and the cash runway is [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1447.6799999999998s)]
*  running short and you need, you need some money, you know, you need maybe, you know, maybe a [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1452.72s)]
*  partnership or a licensing deal creates an opportunity to demonstrate some validation. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1457.92s)]
*  Like there's, there's very clear, I think scenarios for, for new small, you know, early clinical stage [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1465.92s)]
*  biotechs to seek, to seek partnership, to sell asset, whatever, like there's a very, you know, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1471.84s)]
*  it's often directive, like we need to do this to do the next thing we want to do. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1478.0s)]
*  In a company like Regeneron, when you walked in, you know, to your point, like flush with cash, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1482.08s)]
*  commercial, just about commercial stage, right? Like things are going well. What is the motivation? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1488.16s)]
*  Like what was the motivation at that point to, I guess, invest in business development, invest [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1495.28s)]
*  in a role like yours? Well, again, like what was unusual about the role and what attracted me to [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1502.56s)]
*  it, frankly, was the company was at a stage where it was doing transactions on the sell side still [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  as a small boss making company and, and also emerging to be on the buy side. So it was kind [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1514.6399999999999s)]
*  of both sides of the deal making table, which is pretty unusual and was like exciting for me as a [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1519.76s)]
*  deal maker, I want to be able to have that variety of different kinds of things to think about and [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1525.2s)]
*  work on. So on the sell side of things, I mean, you know, at the time and the early days that I was [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1529.04s)]
*  there, you know, when I, Leah was just getting launched, you know, there really was not, and, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1535.52s)]
*  you know, you're sure people tell different versions of history, but my recollection was [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1540.0s)]
*  nobody was going to say I, Leah was going to be a $10 billion product, right? If it was going to be [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1544.8799999999999s)]
*  billion dollar product, we were going to jump up and down and give each other high fives as a huge [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1549.68s)]
*  success. So at that time, there was still this big notion of, you know what, let's make sure we don't [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1553.68s)]
*  bite off more than we can chew, right? As a company, let's not over invest in, you know, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1559.52s)]
*  big trials for some of our pipeline. And so let's find partners to help us share that risk and share [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1565.3600000000001s)]
*  that burden. Because again, we just don't want to get too, you know, bullish about our future that [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1572.5600000000002s)]
*  we wake up and say, Oh my God, we just overdid it. So that was part of the motivation to continue to [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1577.68s)]
*  be, you know, on the quote sell side and find partners for some of our products and, you know, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1582.48s)]
*  bring in other sources of funds on the buy side. You know, again, my motivation, and it wasn't the [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1586.96s)]
*  organization's point of patient. It was kind of like we needed to bring people along to this kind [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1594.48s)]
*  of thinking. It was with a very long time horizon in mind, which, and my kind of thinking at the time [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1598.48s)]
*  was, look, you know, Regeneron at that point in time, I think what most people would acknowledge [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1604.88s)]
*  was the world leader in antibody technology and capabilities. I mean, there were other people in [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1611.6s)]
*  the game, but it really had distinguished itself as, you know, really proven the best quality [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1616.48s)]
*  antibodies, the fastest turnaround times, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera. And the thinking [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1622.08s)]
*  was, let's leverage that and turn that crank and turn that into the most value of most drugs that [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1627.12s)]
*  we possibly can, which was correct. But I think that, you know, one of the mistakes companies make [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1632.7199999999998s)]
*  and at risk is you get so focused on executing on kind of the here and now stuff. You kind of forget [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1637.68s)]
*  about investing and well, what's going to be that thing in 10 years from now, because the world [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1643.92s)]
*  catches up to you. That's just the nature of our industry. When you have a technology as successful [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1648.4s)]
*  as Regeneron's Velocihume technology was, there's going to be people that come in and copycat and [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1652.72s)]
*  try to follow what you do. And then inevitably there's, you know, becomes commoditized. You know, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1659.1200000000001s)]
*  are we there today? I don't know, but we're getting close. Right. And so that's just the nature of [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1663.4399999999998s)]
*  competition and technology. It's unavoidable. And so for me, it was really like, we need to [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1669.12s)]
*  not lose sight of that, but we need to start positioning ourselves for what is going to be [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1674.6399999999999s)]
*  the next Velocihume like super platform that Regeneron is leading the way in 10 years from now. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1679.6s)]
*  And you got to make those investments along the way now and start planting those seeds. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1685.52s)]
*  And so that was a lot of motivated kind of my early thinking was what are those areas we need [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1690.24s)]
*  to start planting seeds into so we can wake up in 2023 and be a real player in kind of a new [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1695.1999999999998s)]
*  field beyond antibodies. Yeah. Is it the same team on the buy and sell side at Regeneron? And [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1702.08s)]
*  is it typical for like the same team to work on buy and sell side transactions? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1711.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's atypical for companies to even do both of those. I mean, big pharma for sure does, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1717.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, divestitures, right? Cleaning the portfolio, we've shelved this program, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1722.3200000000002s)]
*  and I don't have a lot of visibility into how they organize that. I believe most of those guys have [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1727.3600000000001s)]
*  dedicated groups that are just out there shopping the, you know, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1733.52s)]
*  garage sale stuff they don't want anymore. Yeah. So the way we do it at Regeneron, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1737.1200000000001s)]
*  which was kind of how I learned it at Genentech, frankly, and maybe why we do it this way, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1743.68s)]
*  is we have one team that kind of does everything. We do the scouting, we do the due diligence, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1747.76s)]
*  we do the negotiations, you know, we do the internal strategy. And part of it is just to [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1752.88s)]
*  have that continuity throughout the process so you don't lose stuff when you're passing the baton [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1757.52s)]
*  from kind of one, you know, silo to the next. And part of it is necessity, just because we're lean [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1761.44s)]
*  and mean company, we can't afford to have 50 people in business development and have 10 scouts and 10 [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1767.2s)]
*  due diligence leads. So that's atypical. You know, most of our bigger peers, you know, are more [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1772.24s)]
*  siloed and expert in how they organize the VD teams. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1779.44s)]
*  When it comes to turning your innovations into clinical realities, the first step is transforming [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1783.84s)]
*  your process. On the Business of Biotech podcast, we bring Emerging Biotech's weekly insights to [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1788.96s)]
*  advance their pipelines, from funding to regulatory and other need to know topics. The pod is a [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1794.56s)]
*  broad to you in collaboration with Cytiva, a global provider of technologies and services [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1802.32s)]
*  that advance and accelerate the development, manufacture and delivery of therapeutics. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1807.6s)]
*  Check out the resources at Cytiva.com backslash emerging biotech. That's C-Y-T-I-V-A.com [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  backslash emerging biotech. So you talked about, like on the buy side, you talked about pipeline, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1821.12s)]
*  longer term pipeline development and asset acquisition and making sure that you've got [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1829.8400000000001s)]
*  stuff to work on. The next big thing, 10 years down the road. But we know in biopharma that [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1835.3600000000001s)]
*  pipelines, you know, they turn over, assets come and assets go. As that happens, sort of the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1842.0800000000002s)]
*  normal cyclical playing out of the science and the clinical trials and the money that [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1850.72s)]
*  dictate sort of what assets remain in the pipeline and what don't. What else creates like, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1856.4s)]
*  I guess, a catalyst for you to go out on the buy side, to go out and hunt? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1864.0800000000002s)]
*  Like I'm just looking for, I guess, like other indicators of, you know, of partnership necessity [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1872.48s)]
*  or buy necessity. Yeah, I mean, well, necessity is an interesting word. I mean, that's kind of where [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1881.0400000000002s)]
*  I was going to go with the answer. I mean, sometimes deals are motivated by necessity, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1885.84s)]
*  right? There is a gap or there is a, you know, a revenue goal or there's a therapeutic area [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1890.9599999999998s)]
*  leadership, whatever, right? And you're trying to get somewhere. And in order to get there, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1898.1599999999999s)]
*  there's a necessity, you know, to acquire something because the internal stuff are perceived [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1902.8799999999999s)]
*  necessity, right? And that motivates a lot of, you know, deal making for sure. That is not really [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1907.1999999999998s)]
*  how we organize ourselves and even run the company in a grander sense. And, you know, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1914.08s)]
*  we don't really have long-term five-year financial goals or pipeline goals. I mean, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1920.3999999999999s)]
*  Regeneron strategy is follow the science. And we kind of really mean that in the sense that [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1926.48s)]
*  we invent a lot of drugs. We don't even know which ones are going to really work. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1931.76s)]
*  We look at the data. We decide which ones to invest in, not based on some grand overarching [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1935.4399999999998s)]
*  therapeutic area strategy. It's just this drug looks like it's going to work and help the most [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1940.48s)]
*  people. So let's do that one. You know, it's really not this big top-down master plan. It is [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1944.32s)]
*  purely let's look at data together and figure out what those data tell us to do, which has running [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1949.6s)]
*  in all kinds of crazy directions. It's difficult to manage a company that way, but, you know, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1954.8s)]
*  you got to credit to our leadership over the years. They've done a pretty impressive job. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1958.88s)]
*  So what does motivate our deal making is a little less about necessity. It's kind of more about, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1964.32s)]
*  like, you know, being opportunistic and looking at what is it that we are doing maybe better than [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1969.2s)]
*  the rest of the world. Like as an example, you know, five years ago, maybe eight years ago, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1977.76s)]
*  I can't remember now, we made this decision to invest in a dramatic way in human genetic sequencing. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1982.16s)]
*  And the vision was like, let's not dabble. We want Regeneron to be the number one place in the [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1989.68s)]
*  world in terms of, you know, numbers of samples, quality of data, access to patient data, and let's [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=1995.12s)]
*  make the greatest discoveries based on large scale human genome sequencing. And we've done that. You [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2002.4799999999998s)]
*  know, I don't know, we're number one, number two, wherever we are. I mean, it's like, we're at the [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2007.84s)]
*  top of the world now. So some of the deal making stuff comes from, okay, now that we're there, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2010.6399999999999s)]
*  we have this resource, this asset, this capability. Can we be opportunistic and think about how do we [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2016.4799999999998s)]
*  leverage that? And that led us into things like gene editing and RNAi as modalities to drug some [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2022.16s)]
*  of these novel targets that come out of that. You know, it led to, you know, a lot of conversations [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2029.76s)]
*  we had. We did one transaction with AstraZeneca as an example to discover, you know, small molecules [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2035.28s)]
*  against a novel target. How do we take advantage of this unique, these genetic targets and turn them [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2041.1200000000001s)]
*  into drugs through interesting collaborations? So it's kind of this necessity versus opportunism [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2046.5600000000002s)]
*  which we ended up playing a lot more in this kind of opportunistic mindset than a lot of our peers [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2053.12s)]
*  do. Do you find yourself constantly being courted? Like, are you like constantly being courted by [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2057.92s)]
*  companies who want to offload assets or partner or be acquired wholesale? You know, it's interesting. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2065.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes. But I, you know, I don't know how that compares to, you know, my peers at Amgen or J&J. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2073.52s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder, they probably get 10 times as much as we do. I mean, Regeneron has a reputation [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2079.12s)]
*  and like rightly earned. We're not out there like shopping and buying other people's stuff. That's [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2084.16s)]
*  not, you know, we don't sit here and say we have an aspiration for our pipeline to be, you know, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2088.4s)]
*  55% source through external innovation, which a lot of other CEOs say, you know, with pride. That's [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2093.2799999999997s)]
*  like, that is a good badge of honor. Look how good we are of accessing external innovation. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2099.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, we're kind of the opposite. You listen to, you know, Len and George talk, it's homegrown [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2104.64s)]
*  assets and we're very proud of what we've generated. So, you know, we have this reputation [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2108.64s)]
*  and in practice, like we're not out there shopping much and buying much and people know that. So, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2113.68s)]
*  you know, we get not, people approach us for sure, but I'm sure it's nowhere near [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2119.2799999999997s)]
*  what we would get if we were big spenders like, you know, the Gilead's and cell genes used to be. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2123.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. When you do enter into a partnership agreement, I want to talk about some nuts and [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2129.6s)]
*  bolts, maybe some mechanics. Like what is that? And again, I know, you know, as we've ascertained, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2137.3599999999997s)]
*  there's, there are plenty of different recipes, plenty of different scenarios, but what are some [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2142.24s)]
*  of the, I guess, basic kind of bolted down contractual, you know, partnership contractual [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2146.96s)]
*  elements that are common? I mean, semantics is like, I find that to be kind of sometimes frustrating [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2153.12s)]
*  when we talk about these deals. Does this say outlicensing, in licensing? Is this a collaboration? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2160.72s)]
*  You know, what is this thing? So I tend to try to not use that type of verbiage because like, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2165.52s)]
*  you know, that's not a great descriptor for what's really going on. Some of them are kind of loaded [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2172.08s)]
*  terms, I find, you know, as we were talking the other day with some of our senior R and D guys, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2176.2400000000002s)]
*  and we're saying, Hey, we're thinking about an out licensing deal for our project X and out licensing [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2180.08s)]
*  deal. No, what are you talking about? You know, no, no, no, we want to be involved in that program. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2187.12s)]
*  Don't out license it. I'm like, no, no, no, that's not what I meant. I meant, we're going to find a [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2191.04s)]
*  partner who we're going to grant a license to, to conduct certain activities, you know, blah, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2194.72s)]
*  blah, just relax, you know? So these are kind of loaded terms. That's why I try not to use them, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2198.4s)]
*  or at least encourage people to think a little bit more sophisticated, you know, Lee, about what's [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2204.16s)]
*  really going on. So like, for example, when I look at these deals, and this is technical stuff, and [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2210.7999999999997s)]
*  that's why it's hard for like laypeople. And you can't even see that sometimes these deals aren't [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2216.24s)]
*  even made public because a lot of these contracts are redacted or people aren't going to take the [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2220.16s)]
*  time to download a, you know, filed transaction agreement from some 10 Q. But the things that I [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2223.84s)]
*  think really matter that kind of, you know, put these transactions into different categories and [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2230.16s)]
*  different buckets, it really boils down to, you know, which party in that transaction has the [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2234.64s)]
*  contractual obligation, meaning if they don't do it, they're going to get sued to do stuff, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2242.0s)]
*  who has to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the drug, right? That [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2248.0s)]
*  one party will be assigned that obligation, right? And that is the lead party in the deal, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2254.88s)]
*  right? Whether that's an in license, out license, because what licensing means, right? Licensing [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2260.96s)]
*  just means I wrote down on this piece of paper, you're allowed to do activity A, B, and C, and I [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2265.6800000000003s)]
*  won't sue you. And these are the activities I'm licensing you to do that I'm not going to sue you [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2270.6400000000003s)]
*  over. Okay. And there's licenses that go in every direction because parties are all doing different [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2277.2000000000003s)]
*  things and you need these licenses to do things. So I don't even really look at that so much as the [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2281.92s)]
*  license grants. To me, it's who has the obligation contractually to do things, right? To devote [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2286.7200000000003s)]
*  resources, to be diligent, to execute stuff, like that's really important. The other is decision [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2293.6800000000003s)]
*  making, right? The governance, right? It's like at the end of the day, everyone says, well, we're [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2299.6800000000003s)]
*  going to sit down and we're going to agree on what to do, you know, but always, I mean, maybe one out [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2304.32s)]
*  of a hundred times, you know, there's an exception, but 99 out of a hundred, one party at the end of [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2310.16s)]
*  the day gets to decide what to do. If there's a dispute over the budget, there's a dispute over [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2316.72s)]
*  a plan, you know, you escalate it, whatever, someone ends up deciding. If you can't function [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2321.52s)]
*  without, you can't really live with this stalemate. Sometimes you see deals with that, but again, it's [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2326.7999999999997s)]
*  weird and it's very rare. And so that, you know, really, I look at that, okay, who really is the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2331.2s)]
*  final, final say at the end of the day? You know, that really matters a lot to me in terms of, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2336.96s)]
*  you know, what the deal is, right? And then it just, is there, are there even in the last bucket, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2342.8s)]
*  is like, are there even ongoing activities by the seller, right? Because the seller sometimes is like, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2348.48s)]
*  hey, here's a license to my patent, right? Run with it. You guys don't need us anymore. You know, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2354.16s)]
*  you know how to synthesize this thing. You know how to conjugate this thing. I'm doing nothing. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2359.92s)]
*  I just am giving you, I'm just collecting a check. And, you know, that to me matters in terms of, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2366.3199999999997s)]
*  it's just really a collaboration, right? The word collaboration gets thrown around a lot. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2371.44s)]
*  But to me, what collaboration means is the seller is actually doing stuff of real importance and [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2376.3199999999997s)]
*  criticality to the project. And that's not always the case, right? Because when we want to do a [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2383.2s)]
*  collaboration, then we need to really look hard at the people, you know, who are, who's going to [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2388.3199999999997s)]
*  be doing the work? What's their track record? Do they have the resources? Do they have the [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2394.08s)]
*  aligned vision or are they at 50 other things they want to be doing? Are they motivated? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2398.48s)]
*  You know, but if it's not a collaboration, because they're not doing anything, then that stuff [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2403.2s)]
*  doesn't matter, right? It just, then it's about like, how good is the technology? What kind of [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2409.12s)]
*  deal are we getting? Are there other risks? What's, you know, blah, blah, blah. So like those three, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2413.12s)]
*  I guess, I don't know, dimensions to me, you know, if you study a deal and you think about it, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2419.2s)]
*  that way, it's a much more, you know, clear way to think about what is this, what's really going [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2423.84s)]
*  on in this deal. Yeah. Yeah. How much foresight do you apply? Like you talk about collaboration [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2428.6400000000003s)]
*  and what collaboration truly means. And if the seller isn't really, really collaborating, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2434.1600000000003s)]
*  is that a potential pitfall where you can find yourself in a bad deal? Like in other words, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2441.6000000000004s)]
*  like, you know, there's a intended, obviously, an intended outcome to this partnership, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2446.0s)]
*  this collaboration. And should we go commercial, you know, should there be a ton of money to be [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2452.56s)]
*  made on this collaboration? But, you know, the collaboration isn't a truly collaboration. Like, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2457.52s)]
*  does that sit wrong? No, I don't think so. I think a lot of it, you know, where things get [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2462.96s)]
*  screwed up is misaligned expectations, like in so many things in life. You know, people enter into [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2468.0s)]
*  these deals thinking it's going to go one way. And we thought we had this agreement at the beginning [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2473.92s)]
*  that this is how it's going to all work out. And it turns out like, oh no, no, actually, I had a [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2479.2s)]
*  very different intention. I never intended for you guys to play a big role here. We were always going [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2483.2799999999997s)]
*  to lead this particular activity. And when you get that kind of misalignment of what people thought [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2488.24s)]
*  they were either buying or getting in return and what they actually get, like that's when the [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2493.3599999999997s)]
*  friction really starts happening. And that's something I see all the time, you know, that [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2497.8399999999997s)]
*  doesn't get enough attention time. It's just like, let's just get managements together. Let's just [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2503.04s)]
*  go through this somewhat mundane activity of why are we doing this? Can we all just be on the same [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2508.96s)]
*  page? What are we trying to achieve? You know, because sometimes you just start running, you do [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2514.16s)]
*  the deal and you run into it and you find out, wait, we weren't even really on the same page all [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2517.76s)]
*  along. You know, so that's a big one for sure. It's just the misalignment of, you know, expectations [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2521.52s)]
*  more than anything. How involved are you like sort of post contractually? How involved do you remain [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2528.0s)]
*  in collaborative, you know, whatever word you want to ascribe to it, right? Strategic collaborations [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2536.0s)]
*  or partnerships or whatever. Not very much. I mean, like most groups, we have a dedicated function. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2541.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like full-time job is just to make sure these collaborations work well and we're communicating [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2546.2400000000002s)]
*  and everyone's doing what they're supposed to be doing and resolving dispute. I mean, that really [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2551.12s)]
*  is a full-time job and takes a dedicated set of expertise. You know, having said that, you know, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2554.96s)]
*  these deals are, you know, living things. You know, things change, people change, data emerges. We [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2559.92s)]
*  want to do this. So we never contemplated, you know, that this would ever happen. You know, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2565.92s)]
*  good, sometimes good, sometimes bad. You want to expand, you need to, you know, shut down. So [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2570.56s)]
*  that was one interesting learning for me, you know, just in my career is just you do these deals [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2576.56s)]
*  and they never stop evolving and, you know, living. And so in some ways, you know, it's when those [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2581.44s)]
*  moments happen, when it's like, hey, we need to pivot. We need to reassess this where, you know, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2588.72s)]
*  I or my team will get back involved and try to think about how to revise the deal, how to improve [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2592.8799999999997s)]
*  the deal, you know. What have those experiences taught you about the actual business development [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2597.6s)]
*  part of it? Like the way earlier stage, how have those experiences sort of formed up or shaped [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2604.3999999999996s)]
*  your approach, you know, pre-deal? Yeah. You know what I mean? Like what do you look into? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2610.08s)]
*  What have you learned to look for or to be on the lookout for? Well, I mean, when you're doing these [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2618.56s)]
*  deals and certainly in my early days, I had this strong tendency and there's always this tendency [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2624.8s)]
*  as a deal maker to try to think about, you know, when you're sitting down writing these contracts, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2631.84s)]
*  what are all these different scenarios? What could happen? And how do we contemplate that? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  How do we solve for that? You know, what if, you know, these corner cases like that terminology [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2641.1200000000003s)]
*  gets used all the time in deal making? Oh, this is a corner case. Stop solving for the corner case. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2646.4s)]
*  And, well, for those of us who aren't deal makers, describe a corner case. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2651.12s)]
*  I don't even know where the heck that terminology comes from. I think it's a consulting term, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2656.32s)]
*  but like what it means is like, I guess if you think about a box of possible outcomes, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2659.44s)]
*  like it's way in the corner, like it's highly unlikely to ever occur. That's what it means. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2663.84s)]
*  Okay. All right. Yeah. It's funny because I hear that's thrown around so often. I assume that [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2666.7200000000003s)]
*  everybody just uses that word all the time in their everyday life. I make no assumptions. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2670.48s)]
*  I'm sure some consultant invented that word once upon a time. So we'll blame McKinsey or [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2676.32s)]
*  whoever BCG for that. But my point is there's this tendency often in deal making to try to solve for [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2681.2000000000003s)]
*  every eventuality, every corner case, whatever, which great, fantastic. If you can try to do that, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2688.96s)]
*  like great, it paves the way in the future. But what I've learned, you know, to your question is [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2694.6400000000003s)]
*  like, that's impossible. And it's a waste of time. And in many ways, it's counterproductive to kind [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2698.6400000000003s)]
*  of getting the deal done in the first place, you know, because these deals have a cadence, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2703.36s)]
*  they have a momentum, they have an energy. And just like anyone who's done deals, buying a house [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2707.92s)]
*  or whatever, you know, time is your enemy, right? People lose interest, they get distracted and [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2713.36s)]
*  other things, you know, look interesting to them. So when you spend, you know, nine months trying [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2718.08s)]
*  to solve every possible little scenario, which none of them are going to likely happen, the deal [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2722.88s)]
*  may not happen in the first place. So trying to get more comfortable with some of that ambiguity [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2728.0s)]
*  and leaving things a bit open, knowing that we're going to have to come back together anyway, to [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2734.0s)]
*  renegotiate and agree on stuff. That's been a kind of, I think, an evolution in my approach and [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2739.12s)]
*  thinking as a BD person is just, maybe we don't need to solve everything right now. You know, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2744.24s)]
*  we'll take some risk, right? We'll take some risk knowing that we might get some suboptimal [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2748.72s)]
*  solution later, right? Because as a buyer, that's when you have the leverage. Yeah, you want my big [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2752.8s)]
*  check, you know, agree to all my provisions now. It's like, well, all right, I'm willing to take [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2757.36s)]
*  the risk that I'm going to get a worse deal on this future unknown point, but that's okay. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2761.84s)]
*  You know, we'll solve it, you know? So just that mindset has changed for me. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2767.84s)]
*  Who do you want at the table? Like from a, I guess, a persona or title's perspective, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2772.8s)]
*  who do you want at the table to really do the due diligence that you expect of yourself when [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2780.48s)]
*  you're exploring a deal? Specifically around the due diligence piece of it? Well, yeah, maybe walk [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2785.2s)]
*  us through the progression. You know what I mean? Like when you first engage, when you engage in [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2792.8799999999997s)]
*  conversation, you know, at all, like with a company that you're interested in partnering with. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2797.52s)]
*  And again, I'm sure that there are several different permutations, but generally, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2805.12s)]
*  like who do you want at the table? Like I said, that might change as you go down the line, right? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2809.12s)]
*  You're like, it's a point where you want to talk to some like lead scientists, maybe, I don't know, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2815.6s)]
*  but like walk us through sort of that progression of who's involved in an ideal new had, Hussaini [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2819.2s)]
*  situation. Yeah, I mean, I don't know who coined this, but it's apropos, a lot of people use this, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2826.48s)]
*  this kind of want, find, get is like the, you know, rubric that, you know, all BD groups do, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2833.04s)]
*  right? What do we want? The strategy, the find, the sourcing, the diligence, the get, the transaction [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2839.2s)]
*  piece of it. The hardest part and what I spend most of my time and energy doing, and the most [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2844.56s)]
*  important part is the want, right? It's the internal conversations of like, what are we even doing? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2851.2s)]
*  And why are we doing it? And especially at Regeneron, where we don't have these master [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2857.04s)]
*  strategies and goals and we need this many phase three products and this much revenue, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2862.16s)]
*  it's purely opportunistic. It's what are we even doing? And so to your question of like, who do I [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2867.7599999999998s)]
*  want to need at the party for that part of the process? It's a champion. It's an influential [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2874.48s)]
*  person that can help me and my team like drive alignment of, yeah, this is what we want. And we [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2881.44s)]
*  really mean it. We're serious, right? Cause what happens a lot of times in deal making, it's like, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2888.4s)]
*  you know, you're half serious and that's the worst thing possible. You run down the path with only [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2892.8s)]
*  half conviction and you change your mind. You don't know why you're doing it in the first place. And [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2898.56s)]
*  it's a disaster. The other side's pissed off. You wasted their time. They could have been doing [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2902.8s)]
*  another deal. You know, so avoiding that to me is like goal number one. What are we doing? Let's be [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2906.7200000000003s)]
*  damn sure we know exactly what we're doing and why, and we all love it. And we're all going to [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2912.56s)]
*  be pissed if we don't, if we don't get this deal, we're going to be really sad. Right. So how do we [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2916.0s)]
*  find those kinds of opportunities? So finding a senior R and D person, that's who it is in [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2920.32s)]
*  Regeneron. Those are the influential people. It's not going to be the commercial director that says [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2926.0s)]
*  we have to do this. It's some leader in R and D that says, I believe in this science. This is [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2929.6s)]
*  game-changing stuff. And the team is really, really good on the other side. That's who I want there. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2933.76s)]
*  Yeah. The diligence piece is fairly straightforward, right? There's a lot of people in the industry [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2938.8s)]
*  that kind of know what they're doing and been there, done that, developed drugs. So if you run [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2944.08s)]
*  a good process there, you're probably going to discover and find out what's there. I'm not too [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2948.08s)]
*  worried about the diligence piece. And then the transaction piece, I think the key element there, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2953.68s)]
*  honestly, is like decision-makers, because in the moment, you have to make these tough calls about, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2961.12s)]
*  am I going to give on this point or what matters? And who has that level of judgment? Who has that [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2967.36s)]
*  level of seniority and decision-making authority? Sometimes you negotiate with people that are kind [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2975.0400000000004s)]
*  of go-betweens, which is, I can't agree to this. I can't agree to this. I need to go check with my [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2980.2400000000002s)]
*  management. And you can't get anything done in that kind of situation. So you need empowered [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2984.5600000000004s)]
*  people that have the judgment and the authority to kind of sit there. And sometimes there's a [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2989.28s)]
*  deal point that's so big, like, hey, we're going to add $100 million. Okay, I can't agree to that. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2994.48s)]
*  I've got to go back to the executive team or whatever. But having somebody that can be a real [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=2999.12s)]
*  decision-maker at the table, hey, we can agree to this. If we come to a solution, the answer is yes. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3004.72s)]
*  Having that kind of a partner on our side that can do that, I think is critical. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3010.64s)]
*  06.00 Yeah. We're running short on time here, Nouad. I just looked at the clock and I was [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3014.8s)]
*  shocked at how much time we spent talking already. And I feel like we could go on and on and on. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3022.32s)]
*  So I have a few more questions for you. I just want to wrap things up here. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3028.48s)]
*  So one of them would be advice. The majority of our audience is new and emerging, leaders of new [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3033.52s)]
*  and emerging biopharma companies, many of whom perhaps have not experienced any opportunity at [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3039.6800000000003s)]
*  partnership or collaboration. So what advice would you have, I guess, high-level advice would [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3047.68s)]
*  you have for leaders of new biopharma companies who are either dabbling in or perhaps even being [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3052.7999999999997s)]
*  approached? What's your advice for them heading into a potential discussion around partnership? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3060.7999999999997s)]
*  07.00 Well, one thing I would say is just kind of self-awareness, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3067.8399999999997s)]
*  right? And just having a very objective try as much as you can. It's hard, especially for [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3073.04s)]
*  founders that think what they're working on is the greatest thing in the world. And you have to be a [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3079.2s)]
*  cheerleader and a fundraiser, and that's kind of part and parcel for emerging biotech CEO, right? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3084.48s)]
*  You don't take that job unless you're in that kind of cheerleader, optimist kind of mindset. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3089.76s)]
*  But when it comes to kind of deal making, I think you need to kind of check some of that at the door [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3094.72s)]
*  and just have this honest assessment. Because sometimes that's right. Sometimes you really are [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3100.08s)]
*  working on something that is in the top 10 percentile of stuff that buyers want. And if [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3104.16s)]
*  that's the case, it's going to be a different experience and a different process and maybe [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3110.88s)]
*  different answer to your question in terms of what to do. But in the other 90 percent of the case [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3114.88s)]
*  where you're onto something, it's good. But let's be honest, and you should be honest with yourself, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3120.08s)]
*  it's not the top 10 percent crown jewels of what's out there. It's good. It's useful. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3124.88s)]
*  But when you're in that kind of situation, my advice would be just get started, right? Just [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3129.84s)]
*  get something going because these partnerships are, as I was talking about earlier, they're [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3136.56s)]
*  living things. If it's going well, they're going to expand. There's going to be more opportunity. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3144.56s)]
*  So one thing is try not to sell the farm and bundle all this stuff together if you can in [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3149.3599999999997s)]
*  your first deal. Start small. Get to know a partner. You're going to find maybe some of [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3157.12s)]
*  these partners aren't the right fit for you guys in one way or shape or form. And so I guess that [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3163.3599999999997s)]
*  kind of boils down to that. Narrow scope for that first deal. If you're in that other 10 percent [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3168.96s)]
*  category, OK, fine, go big. You're going to do your big auction. You're going to find, get Merck to [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3174.0s)]
*  pay you $10 billion for your ADCs or whatever. But that's, I think, so that's the first thing. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3179.04s)]
*  Just figure out where you are on that spectrum and have that honest assessment. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3185.2s)]
*  Yeah. Are there resources for companies that may not have good season business development chops [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3188.72s)]
*  heading into conversations like this or opportunities like this? Like, is this, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3196.48s)]
*  you know, I mean, I often have conversations with, you know, CFOs for hire, for lack of a better term, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3199.92s)]
*  like contract. Are there contract brokers, negotiators and biotech that can help small [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3206.08s)]
*  companies? You know, I think a lot of these small companies just can benefit a lot from, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3212.56s)]
*  I mean, there's some tremendous external legal counsel out there that are really, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3218.48s)]
*  really sophisticated and good. And, you know, not just from the legal side, but they've done so many [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3224.7200000000003s)]
*  deals. They know the business aspects, too. So I think a senior executive, a CEO or whoever [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3228.96s)]
*  partnering with one of the top law firms that does a lot of these deals, that can go a long, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3235.84s)]
*  long way. You don't necessarily need to have a beady person there because with that legal expertise, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3242.1600000000003s)]
*  what they need is guidance from the business. You know, what are you guys trying to achieve, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3250.5600000000004s)]
*  CEO? What are your goals here? Help me understand what you want out of this deal. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3254.48s)]
*  And I can kind of get that for you. You know, so the beady person obviously is instrumental in [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3258.96s)]
*  terms of like building these relationships to begin with, right? And trying to, you know, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3267.2000000000003s)]
*  pitch the story and build connections and build credibility. You know, all that's important for [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3272.4s)]
*  these small companies. But if you're asking like, hey, I'm already past that and I'm at the moment [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3277.6s)]
*  where I just need to get a deal done and get a good deal done well. I don't know that you need [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3282.0s)]
*  to go hire like a beady for hire negotiator. I think you can hire a top legal firm and then [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3286.64s)]
*  have the CEO just partner with that attorney to work out the deal. You mentioned earlier the [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3293.12s)]
*  scenario where, you know, maybe a founder has an emotional attachment to his molecule or his [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3300.08s)]
*  project, his technology. You know, there's that emotion. You also mentioned earlier that you want [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3308.16s)]
*  to get involved on projects where there's energy and momentum and excitement on your team. And you [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3313.76s)]
*  said, you know, I want to be involved in deals where we're going to be sad if we lose them. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3321.28s)]
*  You're talking about emotions. This is a very basic and fundamental question. But how do you [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3327.1200000000003s)]
*  do this? What advice do you have for folks to, I guess, shelve emotion when necessary? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3333.92s)]
*  In deal making. You strike me as an, you know, you're energetic, you're animated. Like when you get [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3344.4s)]
*  in a role in this subject matter, you're energetic and animated. Like there's passion there. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3351.92s)]
*  I imagine there are times where you need to set that aside before you step through the door. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3358.4s)]
*  What do you do to just kind of chill out and do business? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3364.2400000000002s)]
*  I know it's funny. A lot of people, you know, kind of say something different than what you just said. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3369.1200000000003s)]
*  They kind of look at me as very cool, calm, like almost to a fault. Like they don't know how to [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3373.12s)]
*  read me. You know, I get that kind of- Oh, the first time, full disclosure, the first time I [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3378.64s)]
*  talked to you, you know, as I said, Alan was adamant that I spend time with you. And the first time [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3382.56s)]
*  I talked to you, I was like, yeah, I don't know. This guy seems like he's, I think you were walking [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3386.96s)]
*  like on the streets of New York when I was talking. I was kind of a little preoccupied. I know, but I [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3391.52s)]
*  was like, I don't know. But now, like now that we've kind of gotten into the role of this [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3398.16s)]
*  conversation, like I said, I see this, this passion and this animation. So, so are you saying [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3401.6s)]
*  that generally you're just- My general demeanor, I think is like more of a cool, my emotions don't [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3407.12s)]
*  really come through in a lot of moments. Sometimes I get, you know, upset if I feel like someone's [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3414.08s)]
*  being unreasonable or unfair or deliberately trying to cause a problem. Sure. Like anybody, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3418.24s)]
*  I'm a human. So anyway, I think part of it is just like, it comes kind of naturally to my personality. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3423.2s)]
*  But I don't know that emotions are so bad. I don't know that it's so critical that you check [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3430.08s)]
*  that at the door, as long as you, you know, they're coming from the right place, right? That's where [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3435.7599999999998s)]
*  it's a lot of it's about, you know, what is the motivation here? Is this a selfish motivation? Are [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3439.8399999999997s)]
*  you trying to, you know, look, you know, tough? Are you trying to look smart? Like that kind of stuff, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3443.52s)]
*  you know, we don't need that. But if you're trying to really get the best outcome for your company and [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3448.72s)]
*  you're just, that's fine. Welcome that, you know? So I try to look beyond that. And it's just like, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3452.48s)]
*  what is the really what's driving this person? You know, what's driving us? What is our motivations, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3456.88s)]
*  pure and noble? You know, like that, I can offer a lot if that's the case. Yeah, very good. You, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3461.84s)]
*  are you, not that I expect you to disclose this publicly on this podcast, but do you have any [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3470.56s)]
*  immediate plans for Newhad, Saini? Are you going to stay at Regeneron for a while? You're going to [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3475.92s)]
*  go lead your own, lead your own biotech someday? Become a CEO, a founder? Yeah. Well, I mean, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3480.96s)]
*  it's interesting. I think at the beginning of the discussion, we talked about when I came to [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3489.84s)]
*  Regeneron and my plan, you know, when I first got here, I thought I'd be here for like two or three [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3493.12s)]
*  years. I didn't think there was any chance I would still be at Regeneron. And my thought was I'll go [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3497.6s)]
*  there and I'll end up going to some small biotech and rise up the ranks and, you know, be a CEO of [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3501.36s)]
*  a small biotech one day. That's kind of the natural evolution for a lot of people in my shoes. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3507.2s)]
*  But, you know, the way things have gone at Regeneron, just the growth of the company and [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3513.04s)]
*  the unique culture here and the unique opportunity to be creative and the kinds of like I was [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3516.56s)]
*  describing. And if I was at a company where it was, these are the four things, you know, and I was [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3521.6s)]
*  handed a playbook, you know, go get these four things. I would be bored by now, you know, but [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3526.8799999999997s)]
*  that's not this, you know, and the job here is like, you have this blank canvas, you have this [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3531.7599999999998s)]
*  incredible, you know, substrate of R&D and we have all kinds of challenges and opportunities, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3535.84s)]
*  help us solve those in the creative way, you know, most creative way possible. So like as a dealmaker, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3541.36s)]
*  it's like, you know, dream come true. I'm kind of in, you know, in a playground here. So from that [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3547.04s)]
*  standpoint, it's fun, you know, I'm not bored and I'm always challenged, which surprises me, you know, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3551.1200000000003s)]
*  at this stage after doing this, you know, for over a decade and kind of the same job. So I guess with [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3556.2400000000002s)]
*  that aspect in mind, like, yeah, I'm not eager to leave because this is a really rewarding and fun, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3562.32s)]
*  you know, place to be, you know, long-term, you know, I could see myself, you know, in a senior [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3567.28s)]
*  role at a company. It's got to be the right situation. You know, I don't look at myself as [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3573.2000000000003s)]
*  like, you know, the true entrepreneur that's going to take some technology out of Columbia and [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3578.0s)]
*  bootstrap my way to a, you know, $5 million seed round and, you know, build the first employees. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3583.76s)]
*  Like that's not what gets me jazzed. I'm not a creator from scratch. You know, I like solving [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3589.84s)]
*  business problems and helping science move forward, right? Helping science move forward by finding [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3596.6400000000003s)]
*  the right, you know, financing sources and partnerships and complimentary scientific expertise. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3602.32s)]
*  Like that's what gets me going. How do I help, you know, see some science actually get to the end [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3608.56s)]
*  because of my ingenuity and creativity. And, you know, if I can, you know, if I can have a [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3614.0s)]
*  bigger impact on doing that, you know, and it feel like, hey, my impact is even bigger, you know, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3620.0s)]
*  than I can have in my role at Regeneron and something like that came along. Yeah, I might [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3624.88s)]
*  be interested in doing that, but it's, again, it'd be like not, it'd be kind of like how I ended up [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3629.28s)]
*  at Regeneron. Something would fall on my lap and it's like, this is the perfect set of circumstances. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3635.84s)]
*  I can't say no to it. So it's possible. Yeah, very good. Well, like I said, I didn't expect [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3639.28s)]
*  you to tell me that you had imminent plans to go do something else, but I appreciate the transparency [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3644.7200000000003s)]
*  there. This has been terrific. Like this has been a great getting to know you conversation. And I [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3649.92s)]
*  think you've also shared a ton of good insight just into the thought process, thought processes [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3655.28s)]
*  around deal making. I thank you, one, for entertaining my often ill-formed questions. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3660.96s)]
*  And I think I'd like to have you back on the pod sometime, sometime soon, and talk a little bit [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3671.2s)]
*  more strategically about some of the things that new and emerging biotechs can be taking advantage [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3677.12s)]
*  of in the market right now, or, you know, discussion around some of the market conditions that are [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3682.08s)]
*  impacting the decisions that they're making, if you're game for that. But in the meantime, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3688.4s)]
*  I think this is terrific. This is super insightful conversation. I appreciate you coming on. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3693.76s)]
*  Well, I appreciate you having me. Hopefully the audience thought it was interesting hearing a [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3698.56s)]
*  little bit about my background and hopefully there's some good tidbits in there, but I'd be [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3702.1600000000003s)]
*  happy to come back on and keep the conversation going down the road. That'd be fun. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3708.32s)]
*  I appreciate it. Thanks, Newhad. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23zuSsHElo&t=3712.1600000000003s)]
