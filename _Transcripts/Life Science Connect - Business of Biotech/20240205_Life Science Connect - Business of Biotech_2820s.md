Video Description: Without doubt, the grand and collaborative experiment that was the mRNA COVID vaccine contributed mightily to the pandemic response and continues to save lives untold. It also demonstrated the collective power of public/private partnership in biopharma. Having acknowledged that, no first iteration of a new technology is ever the best iteration of that technology. On this week's episode of the Business of Biotech, we welcome Carsten Rudolph, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of a company that recognizes this room for improvement. Ethris is developing mRNA-based candidates for the treatment of respiratory viral infections and rare pulmonary diseases, in addition to mucosal, multivalent, and mutation-agnostic prophylactic vaccines. Dr. Rudolph explains the concept, the business case, and how he's navigating Ethris toward a better treatment and vaccine paradigm in the wake of the pandemic.

# Inhalable mRNA With Ethris' Carsten Rudolph, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0)

*  time to map out your clinical course, let clinicalleader.com help. And if optimizing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=22.72s)]
*  outsourcing decisions is what you're after, check out outsourcepharma.com. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=28.4s)]
*  We're LifeScience Connect, and we're here to help. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  Considering that about a month ago, the CDC reported that just 8% of U.S. children and 21% [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=40.16s)]
*  of U.S. adults were up to date with the latest COVID-19 vaccine, which at the time had been [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=46.08s)]
*  available for a few months. It's no surprise I brought the virus home from the J.P. Morgan [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=51.92s)]
*  Healthcare Conference. Between COVID fatigue and vaccine hesitancy, getting into the COVID [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=57.44s)]
*  vaccine game right now might, at face value, seem like a bad business move. That is, if you're coming [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=63.76s)]
*  at the COVID vaccine game from the same perspective Moderna and Pfizer BioNTech did back in 2020. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  But maybe if you bring a new vaccine paradigm to the population, you'd find that COVID fatigue and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=76.8s)]
*  vaccine hesitancy are actually the driving forces behind commercial acceptance of your product. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=82.16s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller, this is the Business of Biotech, and I'll never knock the incredible result of the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=88.72s)]
*  public-private partnership that we saw during Operation Warp Speed. But to cut to the chase, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=93.36s)]
*  there's room for improvement on many fronts. We all know the first iteration of new technology is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=98.4s)]
*  never the best iteration of a new technology. I won't put words in his mouth, but Dr. Karsten [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  Rudolph, CEO at Etheris, agrees with at least some of this sentiment. Otherwise, he wouldn't be taking [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=109.6s)]
*  his company down the path of developing intranasally administered and inhaled vaccines and therapeutics [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  for a number of respiratory indications, COVID among them. I caught up with Dr. Rudolph in San [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=122.08s)]
*  Francisco to tape today's episode. Let's give it a listen. That's where I want to start. I want to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  start with a little bit of background on where you came from and how you got into this space. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=133.04s)]
*  Obviously, I did a little bit of research. I trolled your crowd up on your LinkedIn profile a bit. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=138.72s)]
*  I learned that you have a pharmaceutical degree and have quickly, on the heels of that, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=145.6s)]
*  you dove into the mRNA space. At least it appears that way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=153.2s)]
*  Yeah, what does it mean quickly? I did my PhD, exact period, at the Department of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=157.28s)]
*  Pathophysiology and Pediatrics basically in Munich and at the Ludwig Maximus University. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=164.16s)]
*  My PhD, I was mostly focusing on creating, developing a gene therapy approach for the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=171.6s)]
*  treatment of cystic fibrosis. Because cystic fibrosis, of course, is in a specialty or [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=182.48s)]
*  university pediatric hospital. It's a quite prominent disease. This was always my idea [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=188.4s)]
*  to do research in providing a new potential cure for these patients by delivering genes, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=198.32s)]
*  of course, to replace the missing function in the body of these patients. I mostly worked [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=204.64s)]
*  on non-viral gene delivery that means just using plasmids. We all know, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=211.52s)]
*  I think you're also a biologist, aren't you? No, no, no. I should have set that record [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=218.24s)]
*  straight from the outset. But then I'll give you a brief biology tutorial. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=226.08s)]
*  You've got to toe the line here because I am not. Listeners of the podcast know, I've said it many [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=231.28s)]
*  times, I dropped out of Advanced Placement Biology my senior year of high school. However, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=236.48s)]
*  our audience will appreciate a little bit of flavor. A real problem for using that plasma [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=242.64s)]
*  DNA then, of course, is how to get the plasmid into the nucleus because the gene, of course, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=252.0s)]
*  is active in the nucleus. The lung tissue is a quite post-mitotic tissue, so it's not [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=259.52s)]
*  falsely proliferating where the nuclear membrane breaks down basically. It's really a limitation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=266.48s)]
*  Then we thought, well, and we knew in those days basically that our delivery systems, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=278.88s)]
*  the model particles that we used, we could pretty well shuttle the messenger RNA into the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  cytoplasm. That worked quite well. Then we thought, is there a nucleic acid basically that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=290.56s)]
*  you could make use for the particles that is active in the cytoplasm? Of course, there's the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=297.12s)]
*  messenger RNA that then directly can be translated at the ribosome to produce the missing protein. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=303.68s)]
*  Then this was then the idea, well, why shouldn't we use messenger RNA? In those days, no one was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=311.2s)]
*  really doing a lot of work in this space here. We studied it on this and we saw, well, that works [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=316.64s)]
*  really well. They're much, much more efficient than using plasmids. But we saw at the same time [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  that just a standard messenger RNA molecule, and we know this all now from the pandemic vaccine [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=329.36s)]
*  development as well, it's quite hemogenic because we have a lot of sensors in our innate immune system [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=335.36s)]
*  that is made for detecting these foreign RNA molecules because this could signal [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=342.32s)]
*  just invasion of the virus, like the coronavirus, which is an RNA virus. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=347.68s)]
*  We thought, well, it's very efficient, but it's also quite hemogenic basically. Then we thought, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  how can we navigate around this here? Then we thought about modifying the messenger RNA and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=359.84s)]
*  introducing modified nucleotides because we know from the siRNA field and the oligonucleotide [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=367.04s)]
*  field in those days that if you do so, you can really reduce the immune response and recognition [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  of the RNA molecules. Then we played a little bit of a round and we found really a scheme [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=380.88s)]
*  where we can change the pattern of the RNA molecules so that it's not recognized anymore [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=385.76s)]
*  that well by their immune system. Then we thought, well, that works quite well. Shouldn't we [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=392.4s)]
*  exploit this potential of such molecules? Then we started to form the company. That was the idea [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=400.23999999999995s)]
*  behind it. Yeah. That's why the question I have for you is you were talking about this research [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=406.64s)]
*  work and who was we at the time, like pre-atherists? Pre-atherists. This was my research team basically [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=411.2s)]
*  at the Department of Pediatrics and my colleagues over there. I shared the lab space with another [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=417.92s)]
*  professor and we were running those experiments in these days. Then I was always, because we all [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=423.36s)]
*  know that there are RNA molecule itself, a negative RNA molecule that's not taken up by the sample [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=431.04s)]
*  cell. It does not penetrate through the cell membrane. You always have to package this basically [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  to nanoparticles and then taken up to release the mRNA payload in the cytoplasm. I was always also [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=443.04s)]
*  intensely collaborating with now also my co-founding partner of the company, Christian Klank, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=450.24s)]
*  who was running a research group as a professor at the Technik University in Munich. That's their [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=457.44s)]
*  second large university in Munich. He is a really expert, world-leading expert in designing [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  carrier systems for nuclear assets. Then we thought basically, yeah, we can put this together, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=472.56s)]
*  the expertise and found the company. Then after we got the first business angels convinced, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=478.64s)]
*  then we were really brave. Oh no, we have to do it. I will always remember this moment. It's a [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=486.8s)]
*  funny moment. My plan was just to do something. I wanted to become a full-time professor basically, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=494.96s)]
*  but no, I became an entrepreneur. You brought it up, so now I want to dig into it. You made [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=501.44s)]
*  that decision. Many questions there. What was your biggest reservation? You thought, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm destined for professorship. Then you did this work and you realized, well, there are the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=515.36s)]
*  foundations of a biotech here. What was your biggest reservation about making that leap? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=521.92s)]
*  I would not say reservation. It was more a move, basically, because I always thought that if you do [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  research at the university here, this also should be something where you can, because I mean, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  this is basically the both tax money, the bronze that we raised here, that would be something that [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  you have to give back also and make something useful out of it. That was always my intention [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  of my research that I did at the university. We thought, no, we just have to try it now. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=554.8s)]
*  Of course, if we had failed, then there would always be the opportunity to go back to academia. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=561.76s)]
*  We thought, no, if we don't try it, then who will pick up those ideas that we developed? No one. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=567.76s)]
*  Yes, so we thought, no, we have to restart and do it by our own. That's how we did it. That's great. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=573.76s)]
*  We now have the first program, the clinics. It took us some time. It's a complex thing to develop [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=579.36s)]
*  a pulmonary messenger RNA therapeutic. For sure. We'll talk a little bit about that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=586.96s)]
*  clinical program in a little bit, but from the business perspective, it almost sounds like a bad [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=591.44s)]
*  joke. Two scientists are in a bar doing mRNA research. When you decided that you were going [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=597.52s)]
*  to launch a company, you said you didn't really have a reservation because you knew that you wanted [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  to make a contribution with what you learned. But building a company is a different thing from [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=611.12s)]
*  being a research academic or professor for that matter. So what, I guess, maybe not reservations, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=616.4s)]
*  but what were some of the early steps that you took around learning how to be at the helm of a [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  biotech company? The first thing is to write a business plan, basically. That was the starting [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  point. This was basically, I have to say, that was a trigger. We had in Germany also business [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=635.36s)]
*  plan competitions for young startups. Then we thought, okay, we try to just put down to paper [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=641.92s)]
*  our thoughts, basically. Then you get, of course, structured thinking around what you all need and [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=650.24s)]
*  what kind of value proposition, what kind of drug, and to start to create a financial plan, a budget, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=656.32s)]
*  and all these things. There, I think we self-trained ourselves mostly, I would say. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=664.64s)]
*  Then we thought, now we will try it out and we will do it. We will learn while we do it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  That was the starting point. Yeah. Did you have support resources? So here in the States, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=678.4s)]
*  I'm not sure what the biotech scene looks like in Munich, but here in the States, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  oftentimes startups will take advantage of communities, incubators, even parent companies [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=688.4s)]
*  that spend biotechs on. So I'm just curious, to what degree did you have the opportunity [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=694.88s)]
*  to lean into folks who had founded biotech companies? Yeah. So there was definitely some [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=700.16s)]
*  exposure because our first business angel who helped us also to move this forward and [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=707.28s)]
*  look into the right things that you have to basically consider. So that was, and then there's, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  of course, also in Munich, we have a kind of small biotech hub there with a kind of infrastructure. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  And this was also good where we got some exposure here to this creating business. Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Getting back to the science that you founded the company on, you said it started out with [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=736.6400000000001s)]
*  research in cystic fibrosis. Right. By the time you realized that you had something that was [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  worthy of building a biotech around, what was sort of your therapeutic intention at that time? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  In terms of indications and targets, did you think, well, we can move this well beyond where [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=759.76s)]
*  it started? Yeah. It was always this focusing into the pulmonary space, because that's where [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  I have my home, my scientific home, so to speak, and where I knew this field very good, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=770.0s)]
*  the biology and of course, the exposure to thinking of what you have to consider for delivery, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=777.12s)]
*  et cetera. So, and with, I mean, there are really a few severe diseases, pulmonary diseases where [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=785.04s)]
*  there's not a good cure available. Yeah. So we thought, no, that's a good place to go, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=795.2s)]
*  basically. I mean, we did also some work in those days in bone regeneration to locally [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  translate proteins that are engrafted on collagen sponges to induce bone healing and non-critical [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=809.0400000000001s)]
*  defects, you know, where bones are broken and they don't know anymore that they belong together. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=817.76s)]
*  So you have the help there with biology, then we did also some work in this space, basically, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=825.5200000000001s)]
*  but mostly we then decided to look and go into the lung space now. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=831.2800000000001s)]
*  Okay. Remind me what timeframe this was, when was it? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=836.0s)]
*  So we started to look into using messenger RNA that was roughly around the 2006, 2007 timeframe, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=840.24s)]
*  and we followed the initial most important patterns of our technology in 2009. And then we [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=849.28s)]
*  started the company towards 2011, basically, and really truly operational we became in 2012, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  pretty much 10 years from now. Yeah. That's relative to the recent, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=868.32s)]
*  I guess, advance in awareness and even growth just in terms of the industry and the number [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=876.24s)]
*  of companies who are playing in this space. Those were early days. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=882.4s)]
*  Yeah, those were the very early days. And also, you know, in the academic setting, basically, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=886.0s)]
*  I think pretty much a lot of the birth of the messenger RNA [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  drug modality, I think this was, came really from Germany. Yeah. So we had the longer start, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=898.16s)]
*  I think that were our colleagues from QVAC, basically, Lima and Uwe were the first one who [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=904.48s)]
*  tried to develop messenger RNA for cancer vaccines. Then we had Uwe Scharhin in the same time, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=909.6s)]
*  the founder of BioNTech, who you were thinking of developing messenger RNA for the cancer treatment. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=915.84s)]
*  And it was us, basically, I think, to develop our own therapeutics. So this all [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  roughly in that timeframe, basically. Yeah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  What's fascinating. In those early days, you mentioned your business angel, your angel investor. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=932.64s)]
*  From there, to sustain the company and to grow the company, what was the investment scene like [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=941.36s)]
*  in this therapeutic modality in those early days? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=949.12s)]
*  Yeah, that was tough, basically, you know, because there was not this [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=952.8s)]
*  awareness of messenger RNA. Now everyone knows what messenger RNA is, of course. In those days, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=957.44s)]
*  rather not. And there was also a time, you know, where with the siRNA therapeutics, there were [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=964.16s)]
*  waves that goes up and down, you know. And so there were sometimes some into the asm. And then [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=970.64s)]
*  I remember the time when Roche stepped out of their sRNA, then there was again less appetite. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=978.32s)]
*  And so then it took a little bit again to create the awareness. But this was early, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=986.4s)]
*  it was really entirely new in those days. So how did you, you know, as an academic and [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=991.52s)]
*  founding the company with an academic, beyond that angel investor, how did you learn to navigate the [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=998.4s)]
*  biotech fundraising scene? Like, what did you do in those early days to maintain [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1006.3199999999999s)]
*  the lights on? Right? Yeah, I speak with a lot of people, basically, yeah. And they're [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1010.8s)]
*  going to meetings, to conferences, and to find investors. And that's what we then also found, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1015.04s)]
*  basically, our first investors, who then are basically invested with the company. So that [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1022.48s)]
*  we do the first steps. Yeah. Yeah. Did you see a spike in interest from the investment community [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1029.68s)]
*  during COVID? Yes, I think so. There was, because of the awareness that we got from the mRNA space. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1040.56s)]
*  And you know that, I think it's very important for the field. I mean, in the end of COVID pandemic, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1051.52s)]
*  that was a nightmare for the world. Yeah. But for mRNA, it's a great success, you know, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1056.72s)]
*  they could really, it could be shown that the full potential of messenger RNA that you can develop [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  really fast or a drug product. And most important, we have the approved mRNA vaccine. So it's also [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1070.96s)]
*  now clear that this is a new drug modality that can keep approval. So I think that's very important [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1079.52s)]
*  for the entire field now. So we have so many new great areas where people now [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1088.96s)]
*  exploit or explore the potential of messenger RNA as a new drug modality. So that's fantastic to see. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  Mm hmm. Events like that. I mean, obviously, a global camp, global pandemic is going to have an [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1106.08s)]
*  impact on biotech, not just in terms of like, the repercussions that we saw, right, and accessibility [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1113.4399999999998s)]
*  of raw materials and outsource capacity, that kind of thing. But it can also alter the course of the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1122.56s)]
*  company's, I guess, pipeline ambitions. We saw it during COVID. Yeah. Hundreds of biotechs that [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1130.08s)]
*  didn't have COVID therapeutics suddenly did. We had a little bit the same, of course, you know, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1138.24s)]
*  and we embarked on one program at the beginning of the pandemic with a partner, a company in [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1144.8s)]
*  Switzerland, Neurodun, which are incredibly knowledgeable in identifying human antibodies. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1152.08s)]
*  And so we teamed up basically, and then from the first patients that were accessible to them, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1162.6399999999999s)]
*  they isolated and identified and really super potent human patient-derived antibodies. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1169.76s)]
*  And the idea was that we translate the back, the protein code into an mRNA code, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1178.32s)]
*  which can then be inhaled and you produce the antibody in the lung directly at the site of virus [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1185.36s)]
*  infections so that you have, so to speak, a protective level, a level of layer of antibodies [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1192.6399999999999s)]
*  that are covering the lung tissue. And this worked very well. So we could, nicely, you know, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1198.6399999999999s)]
*  in those days, hamsters were used as a model and we could nicely reduce and avoid this [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1205.76s)]
*  weight loss that you experience after infection with SARS-CoV-2. And we really moved this pretty [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1213.92s)]
*  far. But then what happened all of a sudden, and that's what we also know, this virus changes its [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1220.48s)]
*  face quite rapidly. And then when we reached the Omicron level basically of mutation, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1227.1999999999998s)]
*  we then unfortunately saw that the antibody was not neutralizing the virus anymore. So we [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1237.04s)]
*  unfortunately had to terminate that program. So that's for one. And the second one is basically, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1245.84s)]
*  the program that is now moving about is in the clinics now. We just started the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1254.3200000000002s)]
*  phase one trial just before Christmas. This also a little bit goes back basically to the pandemic [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1260.4s)]
*  time because that's a concept, ETH 47, where we have a methan jar RNA that encodes for a type [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1266.4s)]
*  3 interferon. And these type 3 interferons into the lung, it's called, it is capable of programming [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1275.6000000000001s)]
*  the epithelium into a very broad antiviral state, which interferes with replication basically of any [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1282.96s)]
*  respiratory virus. So a very broad activity, this molecule. And this basically goes also back to [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1290.72s)]
*  the pandemic time because we got big funding for this program from the Bavarian state, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1297.8400000000001s)]
*  yeah, who were looking in those days, not only to put the bet on only vaccines, because no one [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1305.84s)]
*  knew in those days, will the vaccines make it, but we also need therapeutics basically. So in the end, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1313.1999999999998s)]
*  the pandemic had an influence on what we did. Yeah, it sounds like a win and a loss maybe. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1320.48s)]
*  A bigger win than loss. Yeah, absolutely. Bigger win, definitely. What was your pipeline structure [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1328.24s)]
*  before those two opportunities presented? Yeah, just mostly centered only on rare [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1335.36s)]
*  pulmonary diseases. So that's still the focus of our company, because for a program here, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1341.28s)]
*  what I just mentioned, ETH 47, this is a program where you need really a partner with the global [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1347.28s)]
*  footprint to develop this broad basically. But as a small biotech company, we really want to [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1354.8799999999999s)]
*  become a fully integrated biotech company that develops, manufactures, and sells its own drugs. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1362.96s)]
*  And that of course is something you can achieve in a space where you have a [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1370.48s)]
*  sizable patient population that you can serve by yourself at the biotech company. And that's of [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1378.96s)]
*  course the rare disease space. So this was always our goal. And that's why we [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1385.44s)]
*  major focus is on our rare genetic pulmonary diseases. So it's interesting. It seems the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1392.64s)]
*  exception to the rule of like most of the companies that I've talked, most of the CEOs that I've talked [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1402.64s)]
*  to are very clear about their intentions. And that's decidedly not to build their own manufacturing [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1408.16s)]
*  facilities and become an integrated biopharmaceutical company. Okay. If you in the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1412.96s)]
*  end fully manufacture everything in-house, that's a different question. You can use of course [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1417.3600000000001s)]
*  wonderful CDMLs. That's what we do right now. But we established all the manufacturing process there [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1422.0s)]
*  in-house. And that's also important because we have for pulmonary drugs, you have rather higher [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1428.24s)]
*  doses than for vaccines. So we always looked very early on in creating and developing our [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1435.52s)]
*  easily scalable manufacturing process. And we have our now a process developed that is not based on [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1443.92s)]
*  HPLC. So it's just built on tangential flow filtration, which is easily scalable. And it [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1452.8799999999999s)]
*  also the advantage that it's purely aqueous, no solvents involved. And this is what we transferred [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1459.28s)]
*  to CDML. We work with a fantastic CDML there together, manufactures our drug product here. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1467.12s)]
*  I'm interested in your perspective on the explosion of anything RNA space. We'll stick with mRNA, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1475.44s)]
*  but you can put any letter you want in front of it, right? In a COVID and post COVID world. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1483.44s)]
*  And I think about it like you've been working on this science and this technology since [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1489.8400000000001s)]
*  the mid 2000s and before. And for years and years, I'm not going to say it's going on notice, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1498.48s)]
*  but it's not necessarily in the media cycle. And then all of a sudden this pandemic happens. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1506.64s)]
*  And then on the heels of the pandemic, it's like being the only person in the world who thinks the [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1514.24s)]
*  color blue is cool, or even knows about the color blue. And then all of a sudden overnight, everyone's [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1519.2800000000002s)]
*  like, blue is awesome. We love blue, right? I mean, you had to be aware of it, right? Like [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1524.3200000000002s)]
*  the explosion of interest and explosion of companies. I mean, there's so many companies [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1533.68s)]
*  in this space right now. So what's your take on that? Like, it's great for the field. I mean, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1538.8s)]
*  it's fantastic. So the more our approaches we see, the better we get. And there are so many [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1546.48s)]
*  diseases that can be potentially treated with messenger RNA. This can't be done by only one [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1554.88s)]
*  party, basically. And that's great that we have so many different approaches here, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1562.8s)]
*  not only for the vaccines. And I think we will see some new, also potential approvals rather shortly, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1568.08s)]
*  also for additional vaccines in the infectious disease space. But also look into the cancer [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1576.56s)]
*  space here. I think we see really very nice good signals in this space where people use messenger [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1583.52s)]
*  RNA as a drug fidelity. But then look into genome editing. There's a great potential for [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1589.52s)]
*  messenger RNA to be used here. And I mean, we have the first success now for CRISPR, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1597.68s)]
*  being approved CRISPR technology. So that's a huge step, basically. And I think a huge stimulus, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1606.32s)]
*  also for moving this forward by using messenger RNA, basically. And then of course, there's this [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1616.16s)]
*  field of rare genetic diseases where we see, I think, pretty good progress also for liver [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1622.5600000000002s)]
*  genetic diseases. And of course, we want to achieve the same with our pulmonary programs [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1632.4s)]
*  and hopefully offer as soon as possible some help for the patients suffering from these [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1637.9199999999998s)]
*  diseases. So I think there's a lot really moving forward right now. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1646.48s)]
*  Yeah. In the context of your pulmonary focus, what do you see as [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1651.52s)]
*  the biggest potential risk to progress? Whether it's a technical risk or a market risk or a [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1660.08s)]
*  scientific risk, what's the rate limiting factor or big risk that could stand in the way of progress? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1665.68s)]
*  I mean, in the end, it's always the basic concept of developing a drug. And this all centers around [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1672.3999999999999s)]
*  right biology. You have to really understand your biology. Then right exposure, so that you have the [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1683.28s)]
*  right PK. You know that your drug gets there where it needs to be for the right time, basically. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1692.8s)]
*  Then, of course, pretty good the right safety. That's all the basis of a successful drug in the [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1700.24s)]
*  end. And then, and that's what you mentioned, is there the right patient? You have to understand your patient, basically, and then the right commercial. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1707.6s)]
*  So I think it's a kind of umbrella, basically, that you have to look at and go into very detail [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1720.56s)]
*  for each of these elements, basically. And we did this for PCT, for primary celulitis canesia. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1727.52s)]
*  We believe that we hit those boxes, basically. So we tackle very interesting biology, you know, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1736.08s)]
*  because those patients who suffer from the disease, they miss certain proteins that drive the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1745.6s)]
*  motility of the tiny hairs in our lungs, in our airways that are responsible for moving the mucus out [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1754.32s)]
*  of the lung. So that's called mucociliary escalator. And it's made to remove any dust that we inhale [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1762.08s)]
*  from the lungs so that we have a fully particle-free surface of the lung. But what is important to [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1769.1999999999998s)]
*  understand here is that these CDR, you know, they are just made by the airway cells once in the cell [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1775.52s)]
*  life. And the half-life of the airway PT is something like four to eight weeks. And that [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1784.8s)]
*  means you can imagine if you deliver a messenger RNA during the sedation process, you have quite [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1792.48s)]
*  persistent effect. So you translate a quite short-lived drug itself, the mRNA is gone in the [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1800.8s)]
*  lung after two and a half days, something like this, into a quite persistent effect. And so we [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1809.52s)]
*  believe that's a good starting point from the biology. And that's why we, for instance, picked [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1816.56s)]
*  the PCT. The patient is very clearly defined because it's a genetic mutation. So you take [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  this risk out of it, basically of the explosion. We know that we need to potentially restore [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1831.92s)]
*  the CDR function in about 20% of the CDA cells. We believe that's doable from what we see in our [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1840.16s)]
*  preclinical studies, you know. And there is a commercial potential because it's a life-limiting [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1848.0s)]
*  disease basically here. And it's a high unmet need because there are no drugs on the market. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1856.64s)]
*  That's why we believe that's a good spot for messenger RNA computing. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1863.2s)]
*  I could go down a rabbit hole here. Am I hearing you correctly? You talk about this [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1871.8400000000001s)]
*  cellular regeneration cycle. And you're saying that there's an efficacy opportunity at a specific [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1876.8s)]
*  point in that cycle? No, you just have to restore the function. Basically, once the CDR are restored, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1889.68s)]
*  you have a quite persistent effect because the cell does not change the CDR. So it's once built [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1897.1200000000001s)]
*  and then they work until the cell is removed from the body and replaced by a new cell [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1903.6s)]
*  for the lifetime of the cell. Gotcha. Okay. See, these are the questions I should have been asking [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1912.48s)]
*  in AP Biology before I dropped the class my senior year. Not long ago, I had your senior [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1918.1599999999999s)]
*  director of formulation and aerosol research on a live event that I hosted for Bioprocess [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1925.76s)]
*  Online, Christian Doman. Great guy, by the way. He is fantastic. I tell you. Absolutely. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1932.8s)]
*  Yeah. He was super valuable. Just brought a whole lot of wealth of information to that conversation. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1940.32s)]
*  But one of the things that we talked about quite a bit on that during that conversation was LNP [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1949.36s)]
*  stability and some of the challenges around there. So is that, I mean, do you see that as potentially [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1954.32s)]
*  a rate limiting factor? I see that this limitation in the field, because I mean, just look into [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1959.44s)]
*  the commercialized vaccines, mRNA vaccines. So first, we see that they need very cold temperatures [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1967.44s)]
*  to be stored. And that was okay during the pandemic, basically. But now we move into the post [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1977.44s)]
*  pandemic phase. And we really want to have temperatures that the pharmaceutical industry [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1984.0s)]
*  is used to use and also for the patient. So that means this older cold chain needs to be [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1992.48s)]
*  improved and need to be overcome. And I think we have done a lot here with our technology where we [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=1999.92s)]
*  can contribute to this and achieve this. With our technology, we have, for instance, the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2004.96s)]
*  lyophilization process in place, where we see that we can store the drug product already for [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2010.8s)]
*  a year in the fridge, two to eight degrees. And the studies are ongoing, but we don't see any change. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2017.2s)]
*  And even at room temperature, you see this already for more than half a year. So that's, I think, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2025.36s)]
*  a huge step forward. And then also you have to see it and look into the stability of the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2032.64s)]
*  drug product itself. Look, the commercialized vaccines are ready to use drug product. So [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2042.64s)]
*  it can be used for a few hours, basically. And we have with our SNAPs, what we call our LNP, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2050.6400000000003s)]
*  so we have already achieved six days at room temperature. That means doctors can now really [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2057.92s)]
*  plan for using the drug for an entire week. So I think that's a large improvement. And on top, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2065.92s)]
*  you know, we have developed our, we call it stabilizing excipient technology. Those are [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2072.56s)]
*  certain class of excipients from the inactive ingredient list from the FDA. That's that you can [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2079.2000000000003s)]
*  add to the LNPs and you make them mechanical stable. And why do I mention it? Because on the [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2086.16s)]
*  label of the commercialized vaccines, it's mentioned, don't check them because they are [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2094.56s)]
*  very prone to aggregation, basically. So, and we can really now stabilize these nanoparticles [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2099.6s)]
*  so that you can even vortex them, you know, shape them full speed and we don't see any changes [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2106.48s)]
*  in the particles. And of course, this gives confidence to also the doctors and pharmacists [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2113.76s)]
*  to use the drug because they don't have any concerns anymore that might potentially [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2120.32s)]
*  aggregate. And also for manufacturing, you know, when in particular the pill and tendish step, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2126.16s)]
*  yeah, where did these nanoparticles flow through little cubings to basically go into the bio, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2133.36s)]
*  then of course you have to avoid aggregation to avoid any batch failures. So, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2141.36s)]
*  and I think that's really important for what we have achieved here. And then I think another, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2148.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, when we speak about limitations, I think another limitation maybe, and I think that's a [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2156.0800000000004s)]
*  little bit unspoken also in the field is that there are, you know, the combinations from the [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2161.92s)]
*  commercialized vaccines, they bio-distribute to the entire body, yeah, from the documents, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2167.28s)]
*  from their authorization, you see that 30% goes into the liver, yeah, it goes into the heart, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2175.84s)]
*  even if you just locally inject the muscle, yeah, and even 2 to 4% of what's found in the [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2182.7200000000003s)]
*  plazas, found in the brain, basically. And we think if you don't need it in the brain, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2189.6000000000004s)]
*  one should not deliver it to the brain, basically. And, you know, our SNAPs that are... [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2196.1600000000003s)]
*  Seems logical. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2200.48s)]
*  And, you know, our SNAPs that are made from cationic lipid, not cationic lipids, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2203.84s)]
*  they are a little bit more positively charged, so they can package the messenger RNA more tightly, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2212.1600000000003s)]
*  yeah, so you just have half of the formulation, but they lead to full retention of the mRNA drug [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2218.72s)]
*  at the site where you deliver it. And that's, of course, so you can avoid this bio-distribution. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2228.56s)]
*  And this is, you know, for us, for our pulmonary drugs that we develop, we want to have the full [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2234.56s)]
*  activity, you know, of the messenger RNA, of course, at the site where it's needed, that means [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2239.6s)]
*  in the lung, and avoid any bio-distribution. It's also a safety aspect of that. So that's why we [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2246.16s)]
*  think, really, we have achieved pretty much here to move the field in our products also really [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2253.12s)]
*  forward with advantages and to try to overcome those limitations that we just spoke about before. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2263.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. What's been your experience with, I guess, on the regulatory scene? So I have conversations [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2272.48s)]
*  with my colleague Anna-Rose Welch, who's leading a new project at the company called Advancing RNA [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2281.04s)]
*  right now, and we often talk about, you know, some of the uncharted regulatory waters in this space. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2287.2s)]
*  So what's been your perception there? I mean, I think overall, all the regulators are [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2292.72s)]
*  really very, very educated now from the commercialized vaccines. I think that's a great step. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2297.52s)]
*  But you know what I think for the field, it would be very helpful, but that's ongoing already, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2303.6s)]
*  is to consider a kind of platform approach, you know, so where you can more easily, if you leave [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2312.64s)]
*  everything the same in your drug formulation, the mRNA formulation, but just then replace and [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2319.68s)]
*  replace this with another messenger RNA so that you get there certain [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2325.92s)]
*  efficiencies. Exactly. So, you know, this is for us also very important, this approach, you know, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2336.7200000000003s)]
*  because these primary celeritis kinesias, they are not caused with cystic fibrosis by only [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2342.2400000000002s)]
*  mutation in one gene, yeah, but there are more than 50 genes known when mutated that can lead [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2351.04s)]
*  to primary celeritis kinesia, because you can imagine this is a very complex proteinaceous [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2358.48s)]
*  apparatus to get this beating ongoing. And for us, you know, and it would be very helpful [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2364.64s)]
*  to just swap out one messenger RNA for another messenger RNA to then serve for another genetic [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2374.16s)]
*  mutation that causes the disease. So those things that would be really helpful, but I think that's [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2383.68s)]
*  a lot of thinking into this direction already. Yeah, yeah. When I look at like the ATM space, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2391.12s)]
*  cell and gene therapies, you know, there's a lot of bad news. I mean, there's a lot of consternation [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2399.3599999999997s)]
*  about accessibility and cost and even commercialization. I mean, there have been [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2410.08s)]
*  some not so smooth approvals in terms of commercial access. How does the mRNA field [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2416.64s)]
*  collectively ensure? I mean, obviously with the COVID vaccine, it was sort of a non-issue, right? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2424.24s)]
*  We all got our shots. But how does the mRNA world, as it addresses more complex indications [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2429.8399999999997s)]
*  and perhaps charts some complex manufacturing waters, how do you make sure that you're not [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2437.3599999999997s)]
*  making some of those same, I don't even want to say mistakes, but trying to maintain an efficiency [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2443.6s)]
*  that results in patient accessibility at the end of the day? Yeah, yeah. I think you're [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2449.76s)]
*  referring to those gene therapies where upfront you pay a few millions basically for a treatment. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2456.8s)]
*  And I mean, the situation I think with messenger RNA drugs is a little bit different because it's [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2464.88s)]
*  more like a standard drug that you repeatedly administer to the patient. So I mean, for [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2470.64s)]
*  our PCD programs, basically we believe that's a little bit into the direction that you see [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2478.9599999999996s)]
*  for cystic fibrosis where you have already the pricing then here on the market. So you don't [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2485.68s)]
*  have to spend any indications where that cost control might become a factor? Yeah, if you use [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2491.8399999999997s)]
*  messenger RNA, of course, for genome editing, that means a one-time treatment and then you're done. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2499.52s)]
*  Basically, you face the same problems. But I think also the people start to think creatively [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2505.2s)]
*  how to solve this, what you mentioned, how can we find financial models basically that we can [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2510.96s)]
*  also serve those patients suffering from this rare disease? Because in the end, for one rare disease [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2518.3199999999997s)]
*  just a few patients, but if we sum up all patients that suffer from all the genetic [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2528.64s)]
*  rare diseases that we have, those are many patients basically. And I agree with you, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2536.8799999999997s)]
*  but I believe that the field is looking into our creative reimbursement models [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2542.16s)]
*  because we have to find a solution there because we want to provide medicine to these patients as [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2548.8799999999997s)]
*  well. But for the mRNA, I think it's a little bit different because it's not a one-time treatment, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2555.2s)]
*  at least what we do, and then you fix it. But it's those like a standard drug basically. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2562.16s)]
*  Yeah, very good. Just a couple more questions and then we'll need to wrap up. But I'd start with [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2568.24s)]
*  give us a clinical update what the next big steps for atherists are. What's on your immediate horizon? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2575.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. So for us important, and I mentioned this already for the first program, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2581.44s)]
*  we just started our first phase one study just before Christmas. So this is our [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2586.0s)]
*  study that has three arms. Basically, one arm is where we deliver it into the nose and one arm is [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2595.76s)]
*  where we deliver it into the lung. And then we will have after defining their highest dose, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2602.7200000000003s)]
*  basically a combined arm. And we do of course safety, that's their major clinical endpoint. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2609.68s)]
*  But we look into also target engagement, which is very important so that we can measure [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2618.48s)]
*  in nasal swabs and in sputum from these treated healthy volunteers, the production of their [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2624.0s)]
*  recombinant protein produced by the messenger RNA. And more importantly, you know, that we also see [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2632.64s)]
*  the downstream activation of the genes that are induced by the interferon lambda, which [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2638.16s)]
*  gives us the indication it works. Yeah, it is really doing what it is expected to do. Yeah. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2643.52s)]
*  So and this is the study we will have completed towards our springtime. Yeah. So we think we will [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2649.92s)]
*  plan our interim readout or towards early spring, basically. So that's the first very important [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2658.56s)]
*  new step that we expect then in 2024. And then afterwards, we are also in the midst of [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2666.32s)]
*  putting the preclinical package together for filing a CTA towards autumn this year [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2676.7200000000003s)]
*  for our first PCD candidate. And so it's an exciting time. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, very good. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2687.04s)]
*  And then just to wrap things up, when you come to an environment like a giant investor conference [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2695.68s)]
*  at this stage in ethers is sort of continuing on the clinical path. What's your MO here? What's [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2702.08s)]
*  your goal? What are you looking to make happen? Raise money. No, seriously. I mean, now we enter [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2709.12s)]
*  into the clinical scene, basically, and then we need many more financial resources than before. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2715.68s)]
*  That's our goal here at JPMorgan. And also to find partners, you know, because we have a [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2722.3199999999997s)]
*  really powerful, we believe, best in industry platform technology. And of course, this can also [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2727.3599999999997s)]
*  enable and help other potential partners to develop new drugs with our technology. So it [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2734.0s)]
*  would be great to leverage on top of our technology outside our focus area, basically. Yeah. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2741.2799999999997s)]
*  Excellent. Well, I wish you well the rest of your time here. And I appreciate you coming [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2748.72s)]
*  all the way from Munich solely for this opportunity to be on the wall. Of course, Matt. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2754.16s)]
*  Absolutely my pleasure. I enjoyed conversing with you and learning more about what ethers is doing. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2760.96s)]
*  Same here, Matt. Yeah. Many thanks for having me. Thank you. All right. Very good. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYZRU5vpIt0&t=2766.08s)]
