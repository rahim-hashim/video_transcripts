Video Description: Syncromune's Sync-T solid tumor therapeutic platform is, in a word, complex. The company's three phase 1 programs combine T-cell science with a proprietary drug delivery device to target solid tumors, specifically metastatic breast, non-small-cell lung, and castrate-resistant prostate cancers. But, while orchestrating a successful drug/device combination therapy presents unique regulatory challenges and requires a diverse array of in-house skillsets, President and CEO Eamonn Hobbs is confident. He's done this before, and Syncromune's lead candidate has just been fast-tracked by the FDA. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, Hobbs shares his perspectives on bringing novel drug/device combination therapies to market, and reflects on a career dedicated to the drug delivery craft and demonstrated by his leadership at Antares Pharma, Delcath Systems, AngioDynamics.

*  sessions. Just hit the link in today's show notes to register for BioExpo Live today. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=53.2s)]
*  In the biopharmaceutical business, delivery is at least half the battle. We make tumors go away [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  in Petri dishes all the time, and of course we do. The tumor can't escape, its cells can't multiply, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  the drug can't escape and go on to wreak systemic havoc. It's a tightly controlled environment, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=76.16s)]
*  in human bodies though the challenges associated with getting a therapeutic molecule to its target [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=83.04s)]
*  and keeping it there, and perhaps only there, are biologic, chemical, physical and engineering [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=89.12s)]
*  problems that left unsolved will never allow biotech builders to bridge that gap from academic [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  exercise to clinical success. I'm Matt Piller, you're listening to the Business of Biotech, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=102.16s)]
*  and on today's show we're talking with a man who's spent the past four decades working on [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=107.76s)]
*  the interface between advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products and the human patient, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  that interface being delivery technology. Eamonn Hobbs is president and CEO at Synchromune, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=119.04s)]
*  a phase one drug slash device combination company whose SyncT solid tumor therapy platform combines [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=126.64s)]
*  partial oncolysis of a tumor with infusion of a multi-target biologic drug directly into the tumor. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=134.72s)]
*  It's a novel approach using novel T cell science and a proprietary device to deliver the goods. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=142.64s)]
*  On today's show we're going to get to know Eamonn and we're going to learn how Synchromune is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=150.32s)]
*  building a holistic biotech business that's focused as much on delivery as it is on drugs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=154.8s)]
*  Eamonn, welcome to the show. Well thank you, Matt. It's great to be here with you today. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=161.12s)]
*  I appreciate you being here with me today and this episode's not going to drop for a little [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=166.96s)]
*  while but I especially appreciate you because I know you just came off of a very busy and successful [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=170.8s)]
*  ASCO so I hope you had a minute to take a breath before you jumped on the Business of Biotech with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=176.8s)]
*  me but very appreciative in any event. Well thanks very much. Great to be here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=181.68s)]
*  Mm-hmm. As I said, hard to believe looking at you but 40 plus years in this business [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=186.96s)]
*  working on this interface that I referenced, the instrumentation and the mechanics that interface [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  drug delivery and diagnostics with the patient and more so building businesses around that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=202.4s)]
*  interface. It's a very unique, interesting niche I would say that you've built a very successful [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=211.2s)]
*  career and I'm curious about how that all got started. I mean I know you were a bioplastics [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=218.32s)]
*  engineering guy in your undergrad and coming out of school. At what point did you say, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  this is inspiring enough for me to want to go build a career around, as I said, this sort of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=232.32s)]
*  interface between biotechnology and human beings? Well thanks very much. I am an old guy. There's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=238.24s)]
*  no doubt I'll be 66 next week actually. I'll have a good birthday. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=247.68s)]
*  Well thanks so much. I got into combination drug device and drug delivery innovations through an [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=253.44s)]
*  interesting path. I didn't start out thinking that that's what I wanted to do and matter of fact I [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=265.04s)]
*  didn't think that biomedical engineering, material science or even medicine was where I wanted to go. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=270.16s)]
*  It was very clear when I saw Neil Armstrong put his foot on the moon. I said I want to do that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  I want to be an astronaut. Really? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  I had no question and I studied real hard and did everything I could to put a path together to have [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=288.64s)]
*  a shot at getting into NASA back way back when in the 70s. I got an appointment to the Air Force [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=298.0s)]
*  Academy and ended up going entering in 76 which was the first co-ed year for the academy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=305.2s)]
*  Which was a big landmark but I thought I was on my way. I thought I was exactly where I wanted to be, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=313.6s)]
*  when I wanted to be there and had all the tools necessary to have a really decent shot at being [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=323.6s)]
*  an astronaut. Unfortunately it didn't work out. I was informed that I had a progressive astigmatism [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=329.2s)]
*  in my right eye and would likely not be flight qualified by the time I graduated. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=336.0s)]
*  Which was devastating. All my hopes and dreams just went poof just like that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=341.12s)]
*  I had 20-20 vision at the time, didn't have these. I had to make some really serious life decisions [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=346.56s)]
*  pretty quick. The Air Force said you're going to have a great career in the Air Force. Don't worry [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=357.68s)]
*  about all that flying stuff. You'll have a great career in a missile silo or pumping a rocket. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=364.48s)]
*  Pumping gas for all your pilot buddies. I did the only thing I thought was rational and would [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=370.4s)]
*  work for me and that was eject, eject, eject. I left the academy and through really great good [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=379.28s)]
*  luck I ended up at what was called Lowell Technological Institute at that time and now [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  called UMass Lowell which had a great engineering reputation and more importantly would take me [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=395.84s)]
*  in the middle of freshman year which is unusual. I was an advanced placement student so I caught [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=403.67999999999995s)]
*  up quickly and I entered as an electrical engineer because that's what they said I could get into. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=411.28s)]
*  My oldest brother was an electrical engineer and my father was also along with being a lawyer. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  I said, oh that makes sense. Then once I got in there I saw that the coolest engineering that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=425.44s)]
*  was at Lowell Tech was plastics engineering and I was lucky enough to get into that which was an [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=432.0s)]
*  incredible break for me. Then bioplastics engineering became a creation of my own. There [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=440.64s)]
*  was no biomedical engineering at Lowell Tech back then but they gave me the latitude to make it up [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  as I went along. I took all the medical courses, pre-med and even grad school courses that the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=451.84s)]
*  university offered, physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc. I just found I loved it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  I thought, hey maybe I'll be a physician. This is kind of my calling it appears. I'm [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  good at this stuff and I like the engineering a lot. My brain kind of worked that way and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=478.24s)]
*  I was editor of the school newspaper so I was a writer as well which is unusual for engineers. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=485.76s)]
*  A lot of engineering buddies and communications never been their forte [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=491.92s)]
*  and they'd be the first ones to admit it but I had to be an Irish, the gift of the gab. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  So I thought, well you know I'm thinking this is the way to go. Another incredibly good break, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  I was hired by my first entrepreneur mentor in my career, Bill Cook. He was a legend in [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=511.76s)]
*  medical devices. He's no longer with us unfortunately. He passed away in 2011 I believe. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=521.92s)]
*  But he hired me right out of school to come and join his company that was already very successful [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=528.16s)]
*  in primarily in cardiovascular devices in Bloomington, Indiana. I came in and I was pretty [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=537.76s)]
*  naive. At that time coming from the Boston area I thought Indiana was a city in Illinois so I was [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  pretty young and stupid. Now I'm old and stupid but I was pretty green back then. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=553.36s)]
*  And I settled in finally and Bill really took a shining to me and said, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=558.72s)]
*  you know you're doing great kid. What do you want to be when you grow up? And I said, you know, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=566.4s)]
*  everybody called him Bill. I said, Bill I think I want to be a doctor. And he said, no you don't. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  No you don't. I know you and what you do is really cool and that is you have no trouble [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=579.12s)]
*  speaking to physicians and understanding what they need. Understanding what they do and what [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  they need and then you have no trouble communicating that to your engineering brethren back here at the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=594.48s)]
*  ranch. You're a very unique individual and you know pat yourself on the back. That's a really [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=599.92s)]
*  important thing in the development process of innovations in medicine. That's what you do and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=608.4s)]
*  that's what you really are passionate about. Of course again I was young and stupid and arrogant [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  and said, no no I want to be a doctor. So he said, okay I'll tell you what I'll pay for you to go to [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=619.28s)]
*  med school. I'll send you to med school if you give me five years after graduation. And I said, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=626.88s)]
*  done. He goes, but there's a catch. You have to go up to the chief of staff at IU Med Center, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=633.92s)]
*  he's a dear friend of mine who's a surgeon by the name of Don Schwarten and he's going to put you [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=641.6s)]
*  through boot camp. You're going to be his right-hand person until med school starts next season. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=646.8s)]
*  And if you still want to go, you got it. And if you don't, well you've had an incredible experience. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=655.12s)]
*  So I did and I didn't sleep the entire time. I learned how to sleep with my eyes open standing up. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=665.12s)]
*  Don Schwarten was the most amazing individual I've ever come across, incredibly talented. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=672.0s)]
*  And I had a crash course in medicine, what it's really like to be a very active clinical physician, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=678.24s)]
*  a surgeon. And it turned out when you know it, Bill Cook was right. I didn't want to be a physician. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=683.52s)]
*  Patient care is really hard and I take my hat off to clinicians who deal with that morning, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=692.88s)]
*  noon and night, 724, 365. It is an incredible commitment to make to be competent and then gifted [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  in patient care. So I came back to Bill and said, okay, you're right. That was an incredible [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=712.88s)]
*  experience and I got it out of my system. I want to really, really be that interface between [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  medicine and engineering innovation. And he said, great. He said, you're smarter than you look. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=725.68s)]
*  Good for you. That's an incredible story. It was wonderful. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=734.24s)]
*  Yeah. And it's incredible because it sort of comes full circle where you go, oh, well, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=738.5600000000001s)]
*  I just happened to have acquired both the engineering and medicine chops, right? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=744.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  Necessary to build a career around that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=754.64s)]
*  It was. I couldn't have drawn it up any better if I tried and it really things the stars aligned [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=756.96s)]
*  for me. So it was marvelous. So I continued on at Cook Incorporated and Cook was an entrepreneurial [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=763.6s)]
*  venture and Bill was hitting it out of the park. And today Cook Incorporated is the largest [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=773.36s)]
*  medical device, private medical device company in the world with billions of revenue and [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=779.36s)]
*  still family owned. Carl Cook, Bill's only son, only child, is running the show. And Carl [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=785.76s)]
*  and I just caught up a few months ago and was really phenomenal to see him. He was my summer [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  intern in 1980. So yeah, we both come a long way. He's a great guy and very passionate, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  as you would imagine. So marvelous. But again, in the young and stupid category, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=811.12s)]
*  I looked at Bill Cook and said, hey, you know, this entrepreneur stuff seems pretty simple. I [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  think I can do it. So I decided to leave Cook and go off and start my first medical device business [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=822.24s)]
*  called Hobbs Medical. I learned a lot, learned a heck of a lot. I learned that [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  entrepreneurship is really hard. I was a young engineer with a young family and I had to give [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=839.36s)]
*  up an incredible steady growth opportunity job with Cook to start my own business and [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=847.28s)]
*  live hand to mouth. And my wife, God bless her, stuck with me and we got the business off the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=853.76s)]
*  ground and ended up having a good exit with it. I learned about BC and I learned about [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=861.76s)]
*  how to position a company for an exit and I learned about we were commercial, we were selling devices [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=868.64s)]
*  and it was all good. One of the companies that bid for Hobbs Medical was a drug company called EZM [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=873.12s)]
*  and that really was my transition into the world of pharmaceuticals. And EZM was the world leader in [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=880.64s)]
*  GI contrast media and devices to deliver it. So barium enemas and the like. Howard Stern, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=886.4s)]
*  my second entrepreneur that I got to work for and was a phenomenal mentor, took me under his wing and [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=894.32s)]
*  I got a real belly full of what the combination drug device business is like from a contrast media [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=902.56s)]
*  and delivery device perspective. And back then it was really nascent. It was so nascent in fact that [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  GI contrast medias were regulated as devices, not as drugs yet. And when I, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=915.68s)]
*  about the day I joined the company it seemed, the FDA made a landmark decision to recategorize [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=923.12s)]
*  GI contrast medias as pharmaceuticals. So I went through the whole transition with EZM [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=929.8399999999999s)]
*  from device to drug in a drug device company. Again, incredible experience and painful [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=937.52s)]
*  experience for the organization and for the whole team. But I got a real ground up education [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=945.28s)]
*  in what it was all about now to develop drugs and to develop drug device combinations. So [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=953.44s)]
*  did well there and I was, I'll skip ahead to founding Enge Dynamics, but I decided I was going [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=962.1600000000001s)]
*  to start another business and I got EZM to my buddies, Howard Stern and Phil Myers, the [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=975.5200000000001s)]
*  founders of EZM to help finance it. I started Enge Dynamics on the back of an envelope and it was [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=982.16s)]
*  a hard to believe drug device combination company. Our first two products were, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=990.56s)]
*  that we were developing were a system called Pulse Spray, which was a partnership with Abbott [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=997.76s)]
*  on their Avokinase, their Urokinase product, which provided an intravascular catheter [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1006.48s)]
*  to deliver the lytic enzyme into the blood clots directly. And this reduced systemic exposure of [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1012.72s)]
*  the drug, which could lead to strokes and other very bad things, and also decreased the license [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1020.24s)]
*  time dramatically. So here was a perfect example of how you can take a really great drug, but make [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1026.32s)]
*  it way better with a delivery system and make it safer, make it more effective and just add all [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1032.48s)]
*  kinds of value without having to develop a brand new drug. So added a whole new life to Avokinase. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1040.0s)]
*  The other product we were developing was carbon dioxide angiography, using carbon dioxide gas as [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1047.84s)]
*  an angiographic contrast media, an intravascular contrast media, wild at that stage. And at that [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1054.56s)]
*  time, medical gases, including CO2, were regulated as devices. So we, and had very broad labeling, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1061.36s)]
*  basically the indications were use CO2 whenever it's appropriate. So it was a pretty broad label [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1072.0s)]
*  to fit in. So it all looked good. So we developed Pulse Spray, had a great run with it at Angiodynamics [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1078.0s)]
*  and developed CO2. We got our 510K, had a great partnership with Abbott on the Pulse Spray. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1084.32s)]
*  On CO2, not so fast. We developed a proprietary injection system, really an angiographic injector [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1091.6799999999998s)]
*  that was built for compressible fluids like CO2, which would displace the blood in the area of [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1101.76s)]
*  interest, creating a negative contrast zone, and filed that 510K as an angiographic injector with [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1107.84s)]
*  the agency, the FDA, and went through a number of cycles of questions. And I got a phone call from [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1116.6399999999999s)]
*  the project manager at the agency who said, hey, congratulations, I just sent your 510K upstairs [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1129.1999999999998s)]
*  for signature, final signature. You should get your 510K notification in a week or two. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1134.4s)]
*  Great job, guys. And that was an odd one. Good luck with it. And we were popping corks and thinking [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1142.3200000000002s)]
*  everything was great until we got a call from that same project manager who said, sorry, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1150.72s)]
*  not the, this got kicked upstairs for some reason and it's on hold. Your 510K has been put in [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1158.8000000000002s)]
*  escrow, which I was thinking, well, what does that mean? Never heard of that before. So ended up that [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1169.76s)]
*  David Kessler, the FDA commissioner at the time, and his team had decided that medical gases were [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1177.6000000000001s)]
*  going to be recategorized as pharmaceuticals. So our delivery system was no longer associated [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1184.24s)]
*  with delivering medical gas device. It was now associated with delivering a drug that was not [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1190.72s)]
*  labeled for that as a contrast media. So we had meetings. I got to meet David Kessler many times [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1198.16s)]
*  because we were kind of a landmark precedent in combination products. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1204.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was going to ask. I mean, this was new stuff at the time. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1210.08s)]
*  New stuff for the FDA to consider. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1213.28s)]
*  It was. It was. This was 1988, 89. So very new for the agency. The combination drug device [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1214.72s)]
*  pathway was still very, very new, which we've come a long way. Last year, over 400, I believe, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1222.3999999999999s)]
*  combination drug device products were approved by the FDA. So it's a well-paid road down. But back [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1232.0s)]
*  then, it was the Wild West. We were making it up as we went along. So the CO2 ended up needing to [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1238.8s)]
*  be developed as a drug. And it was an unfortunate reality that commercially, no one was going to pay [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1246.6399999999999s)]
*  pharmaceutical margins on a gas that you can get in virtually unlimited supply. I mean, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1254.72s)]
*  I'm producing a lot of CO2 right now for nothing. Nobody's going to pay pharmaceutical margins [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1261.52s)]
*  prices for that. So commercially, the project became a non-starter and we negotiated with the [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1268.24s)]
*  agency and we ended up coming to the realization we have to come up with another way of delivering [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1275.52s)]
*  CO2 that could fit in the device world, which we ended up doing a hand system that got by. But [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1285.28s)]
*  everywhere outside the United States, our CO2 system was commercially [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1293.36s)]
*  successful. So we sold hundreds and hundreds of those systems and CO2 angiography is kind of a [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1300.16s)]
*  standard of care these days. In the US, it's still done by hand, but in the rest of the world, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1306.8s)]
*  it's done with a combination drug device system. So that got me very, very well cemented into drug [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1313.76s)]
*  device kind of being my thing and more opportunities started to come around. My team and I took [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1325.68s)]
*  Engine Dynamics Public in 2004. We had a great run. We were the best performing MedTech IPO that year [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1335.76s)]
*  and we were Forbes top 200 growth company. We were a business week, top 50 hot growth company, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1345.6000000000001s)]
*  and we were just crushing it. I ran it as a public company for five years, which is about the average [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1355.28s)]
*  for public company CEOs shelf life and then was promoted to a co-chairman in 2009, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1362.88s)]
*  which is code for you're out of here. So the board thought it was the time to bring in a Fortune 500 [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1372.64s)]
*  level CEO to really drive the company. It was an extremely successful company. On my watch, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1385.1200000000001s)]
*  we got it to over a billion in market cap and it was a great return for the shareholders, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1391.12s)]
*  great return for my original investors at EZM and life was very, very good. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1396.56s)]
*  So that was 2009 and I had to decide what I was going to do with myself. So I decided I'd join a [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1403.4399999999998s)]
*  bunch of boards and try and give back frankly to young entrepreneurs. And one of the companies I [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1407.84s)]
*  joined was Delcath that had a very interesting combination product system in oncology. And many [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1415.04s)]
*  of the products that Angio Dynamics ended up being in oncology because the intervention [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1422.1599999999999s)]
*  radiology community was migrating that way, minimally invasive, focal oncologic therapies. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1426.72s)]
*  So I had a good base in oncology and the Delcath clinical data, they were phase three developing [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1432.6399999999999s)]
*  a ocular melanoma, METS to the liver, new therapy, which was a drug device combination where the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1442.8000000000002s)]
*  vasculature of the liver was isolated and the liver was exposed to very, very high concentrations of [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1452.4s)]
*  melphalan, one of the original cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. And it would kill the cancer [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1460.0800000000002s)]
*  and amazingly the healthy hepatocytes, the healthy liver cells were virtually immune to the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1465.8400000000001s)]
*  chemotherapy. And when you think about it, the liver filters poisons out of our blood. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1471.6s)]
*  So it made sense that the hepatocytes be able to tolerate this. If the chemo got out of the liver, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1475.84s)]
*  it would decimate the bone marrow and lead to death or at least neutral penia or thrombocytopenia [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1482.7199999999998s)]
*  or both, grade three, four, really, really toxic. So it was very important that the device do its [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1489.4399999999998s)]
*  thing. And it involved a high flow blood filtration system that would filter the chemo out without [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1496.08s)]
*  damaging the blood, which had never been done before. So it was a really intriguing project [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1503.52s)]
*  and required a lot of innovation. And these patients were terminal without an innovation. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1509.52s)]
*  So it was incredibly gratifying to be able to add significant quality of life to these patients' [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1516.1599999999999s)]
*  lives where they really had nothing that was working before. So a belly full of that, we [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1523.84s)]
*  published our interim pivotal phase three data. It showed incredible efficacy. And the company's [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1533.04s)]
*  market cap went to well over a billion, about 1.4 billion, was 28 million when I joined the company. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1542.48s)]
*  And we thought we were cooking with gas. We filed our NDA for the combination product. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1548.48s)]
*  And got a complete response letter, which was a bit shocking, where they said, hey, we love [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1553.84s)]
*  your data. It's really great. But you changed the device during the phase three trial. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1561.04s)]
*  And we want you to repeat the study with the same device. Your study design included a crossover [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1566.6399999999999s)]
*  provision that allowed patients who failed the standard of care, which they all failed, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1574.48s)]
*  to cross over and get the therapy if they still qualify, which was ethically a very [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1579.52s)]
*  reasonable thing to do. But unfortunately, on an intent to treat basis, that meant the Kaplan-Meier [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1586.3999999999999s)]
*  curves were overlapping because the patients that crossed over did just as well. So there was no [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1592.24s)]
*  difference between the control arm and the treatment arm when you accounted for the crossover. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1597.9199999999998s)]
*  When you subtracted the crossover compared to the historicals, first off, all the crossover [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1603.44s)]
*  control arm failed to get there. Two, if you compared it to any historical data, all the [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1610.0s)]
*  patients died. So it seemed really harsh that the agency was throwing the crossover provision [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1617.2s)]
*  in our face. But during the course of the execution of that trial, the FDA had made a big shift and [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1624.48s)]
*  said the crossover is really, although they're ethically attractive, they really do a disservice [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1631.68s)]
*  to getting the new therapy approved. You really need clean data. So you've got to randomize people [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1637.6000000000001s)]
*  and not cross them over. So we suffered through that. At that point, we were looking at having [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1644.24s)]
*  to repeat the trial. It was an eight-year process. I handed the reins over to my second in command, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1650.48s)]
*  Jennifer Simpson, who ultimately ended up getting it approved last year, her team. So a great, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1657.84s)]
*  great success. But I went on from there to another pharma company that I was on the board of that [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1665.28s)]
*  called Antares Pharma, which made combination products, auto injectors and bio-betters, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1671.52s)]
*  taking existing drugs and making them better by applying a device technology or a transcutaneous [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1678.08s)]
*  delivery technology or a depot formulation, really, truly bio-better. And it was quite a [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1683.44s)]
*  factory. It worked with all the big pharma companies and developed very, very innovative [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1689.52s)]
*  and proprietary technology for them and would manufacture the products for them. So I got a [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1696.3200000000002s)]
*  real operational education there in development, in CMC, in device, big, big device division in [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1704.56s)]
*  Minneapolis, Plymouth, Michigan. And it was really fantastic. I took the job as a director [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1714.48s)]
*  going to CEO because the CEO had left at a very tough moment. There's never a good moment to take [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1724.3999999999999s)]
*  a marvelous opportunity, but it was sort of a tag you're it at the board level. You know, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1729.6s)]
*  Aiman, you're the best guy and capable guy to do this. And would you consider doing it? And I [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1736.4s)]
*  thought the number two there, Bob Apple, was the obvious choice. And I said so. The chairman [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1743.28s)]
*  had a new Bob Apple. They've raised him from a pup, as he said, and said, no, I don't think [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1751.84s)]
*  Bob's ready. I love him like a son, but I don't think he's ready. And he knew him better than I [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1756.24s)]
*  did. But I thought to myself, if he's not ready, neither am I. He looks pretty good to me. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1761.04s)]
*  And so I took the job on the condition that everyone would agree I could develop Bob. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1766.32s)]
*  And I was quite confident I'd be able to do that. Turned out that was one of the hardest jobs I ever [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1773.84s)]
*  had because when you're CEO, you're the boss. You get to do what you want to do. And you're [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1778.16s)]
*  you own it. If you're right, you own it. You're wrong. You own it. And you know, life's pretty [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1786.24s)]
*  simple. When you're when you're when you're as a CEO who's developing an imminent number two to [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1791.2s)]
*  take over. You really always try to get them to do it and do it in a way you can live with. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1798.8s)]
*  And Bob, Bob's his own man and quite talented fella. And his way of doing it wasn't always what I [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1804.88s)]
*  what I would have what I would have done. I told him we were very good friends and colleagues. And [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1810.24s)]
*  but it was really hard to kind of be that mentor. Because at the end of the day, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1815.6s)]
*  in a public company, you know, you're still responsible. So I was a little more stressful [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1821.84s)]
*  than I than I thought at the time. But it all worked out great. Passed the baton to Bob in 18 [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1826.4799999999998s)]
*  months. And he went on to have a great exit with the Antares Pharma. It was acquired a couple years [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1831.76s)]
*  ago for a couple of billion. So it was it was all good and very proud of him. He he did a did a great [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1837.36s)]
*  job. So when I left Antares, I I said, Okay, I'm done with the CEO thing. You know, enough is enough. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1844.72s)]
*  I'm going I'm going to find something that that really is is what I want to do without being a [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1855.2s)]
*  public company CEO. So I ended up at the Brigham Brigham Women's Hospital Harvard Med School, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1862.56s)]
*  they brought me in to get their translational medicine accelerator off the ground, they had [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1871.68s)]
*  gotten a big endowment to to really fund translational medicine accelerator really going from [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1876.5600000000002s)]
*  bench to bedside. And they said, we want an entrepreneur like you who has drug and device [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1883.68s)]
*  development experience to mentor our faculty teach them how to be entrepreneurs. And I thought, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1891.52s)]
*  wow, this is this is cool. I'll have my arms around the whole pipeline of Harvard Medical School. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1899.04s)]
*  Imagine the faculty had to bring him I mean, the best in priority, Nobel laureates, etc, etc. I said, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1905.12s)]
*  this is crazy good. And it was, it was absolutely magic. And the faculty was incredibly appreciative, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1911.2s)]
*  even when my lesson was your baby's ugly. You need to kill it. Bail fast. They were still appreciative [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1919.12s)]
*  that that they learned a whole lot. And I thought I was done. I was really very, very, very happy [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1930.1599999999999s)]
*  there. And I got a call from a former colleague, who a research physician who said, Hey, Hobbs, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1938.96s)]
*  you have to come see my data. I'm curing metastatic prostate cancer. And I said, buddy, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1945.52s)]
*  I'm literally standing in the hallway at Dana Farber. And nobody's curing metastatic prostate [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1951.84s)]
*  cancer here. Yeah. So how the heck are you doing that? In Fort Lauderdale, of all places. So he [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1956.6399999999999s)]
*  said, well, come down, I'll show you. So I did. And he did. He had developed or helped to develop a [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1963.2s)]
*  new method of immunotherapy that was showing incredible promise. And in fact, he had a case [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1974.3200000000002s)]
*  series where he was, he was treating very successfully treating late stage cast rate [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1979.92s)]
*  resistant prostate cancer patients who were hospice bound and getting complete responses. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1986.48s)]
*  Unheard of, including resolution of bone myths. It, it as I peeled that onion, it became clear that [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1992.0800000000002s)]
*  he had adapted his case series from another physician who I knew, who had trained him, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=1999.92s)]
*  who had over 400 cases at the time by the name of Jason Williams, who's the real pioneer of this [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2007.28s)]
*  sync teeth therapy. So went to Jason Williams, did a deep dive on his data. Most of it was in lung [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2012.4s)]
*  and metastatic lung and breast combination product of a complex immunotherapeutic with a new device. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  And I said, wow, this is a, this is a massive breakthrough if it's real. It's, you know, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2034.64s)]
*  it's anecdotal data and oh, boy, it sure looks real. So I brought in a team to really go through [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2041.1200000000001s)]
*  the data, including my, my old friend Chuck Link, who was a year behind me at the Air Force Academy. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2047.68s)]
*  He didn't finish either. He went on to med school in the middle of the Air Force Academy, but [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2053.2000000000003s)]
*  in the small world department. And Chuck, Chuck's a medical oncologist, NCI trained, NCI fellow and [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2057.76s)]
*  an entrepreneur himself in immunorecology. He came in, peeled the onion. He said, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2065.44s)]
*  Amen, this is the best thing I've ever seen. You know, we need to figure out how to get this to [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2070.8s)]
*  patients. And I said, I'm thrilled to hear that I'm all in. So I, we put together Synchromune and [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2075.28s)]
*  funded it and got a phase one trial in prostate cancer to the point where we could publish interim [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2085.76s)]
*  data, which we did at the American Association of Cancer Research in April. And I again, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2094.48s)]
*  delivered again at ASCO one-on-one with some of the leadership or every leader we could hold still. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2100.96s)]
*  Yeah. And, and it's just incredible data. We're, we have an 85% in our valuable patients, which is [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2111.84s)]
*  13 out of the, out of the 15 in the trial at that time, 85% overall response rate and five complete [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2119.44s)]
*  responses, which included complete resolution of bone mats. And, you know, in, in immunotherapy, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2127.68s)]
*  when you get a deep complete response like that, it's very often durable. And after five years, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2136.56s)]
*  you know, you can start to call that a cure. Our longest patient out now is well over a year, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2142.08s)]
*  disease free. And, you know, we're, we couldn't be more thrilled. We have another phase one trial [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2146.72s)]
*  in metastatic lung and breast, metastatic breast. And we just had a, well, I can't talk about that, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2152.8s)]
*  but we're having great success there too. Really exciting. It's truly the best project I've ever [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2158.0800000000004s)]
*  been involved with. It certainly has a potential to be most impactful in that there, there are [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2164.96s)]
*  millions of patients every year who can benefit from this therapy. And it's, it's just mad to [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2171.36s)]
*  to, I think it, I think it's worthwhile to talk about the complexity of the drug device combination [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2178.16s)]
*  in that it's not just a drug device combination. And those are hard. We all know that, you know, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2185.12s)]
*  I always say developing drugs is really hard. Developing new, new innovative devices really [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2191.12s)]
*  hard when you combine them. It's really, really hard. It's kind of the Mount Everest of challenges [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2197.2s)]
*  here. And I think that's the biggest challenge that we've had in the last few years. And I think [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2201.92s)]
*  Mount Everest of challenges, you know, from a, from a development, a regulatory, from a clinical [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2206.8s)]
*  everything is just harder. So the juice has got to be worth the squeeze. You know, the first thing [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2212.88s)]
*  to think about about drug device combinations are there are, they are going to be harder, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2217.6000000000004s)]
*  but if the juice is worth the squeeze, so what, you know, we know how to get these over the finish [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2222.0s)]
*  line. You just need the resources to be able to do that, which can become quite, quite significant. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2227.6800000000003s)]
*  So if the market's big enough and the unmet need is big enough, then, you know, it's still, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2233.52s)]
*  still very viable. And in this case, that's the case. So CINCTY is a combination of a proprietary [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2238.72s)]
*  device that creates an insight to a vaccine by doing an oncolysis of a small part of one selected [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2245.52s)]
*  tumor. We're not trying to ablate the tumor, not trying to kill it. We're just trying to rupture [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2254.08s)]
*  cell membranes in a preponderance of cells in a small part of the tumor to release the [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2259.52s)]
*  cellular contents, which include the all important antigens, tumor antigens, which the immune system [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2263.7599999999998s)]
*  can use to build an immune response to that specific cancer. So it's a personalized vaccine. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2270.48s)]
*  And into the device, the second thing the device does is provide a conduit or a, a needle to [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2278.08s)]
*  infuse the drug, which is a multi-target immunotherapeutic comprised of three [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2286.64s)]
*  monoclonal antibody checkpoint blockade and one nucleotide, one oligonucleotide TLR9 agonist. So [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2294.48s)]
*  we are, we are hitting the, the immunosuppression with multiple targets, which, which is quite [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2304.32s)]
*  effective and been shown to be quite effective with systemic therapies, but prohibitively toxic [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2313.84s)]
*  and being highly immunostimulatory at the same time. So the drug is doing a lot of things all at [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2319.28s)]
*  once, but the mechanism of action really is to, to synchronize, hence the name synchromune, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2324.32s)]
*  synchronize the location of the three things you need in order to get an activated and properly [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2331.6800000000003s)]
*  educated T cell. And that is you need the antigens, the tumor antigens, you need the immune [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2338.72s)]
*  system components to, to do their thing and educate a T cell. And then you need the drug [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2346.3999999999996s)]
*  necessary to combat the highly immunosuppressive aspect of what makes cancer cancer and be highly [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2353.04s)]
*  immunostimulatory to force the interaction to take place when you've synchronized the location. So [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2361.12s)]
*  the antigens, the immune system and the drug, that's what the infusion does. And we, the, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2367.2799999999997s)]
*  the magic can happen in the tumor microenvironment, but we think more likely the infusion washes the [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2373.4399999999996s)]
*  antigens and the drug out of the tumor microenvironment into the draining lymphatics, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2382.3199999999997s)]
*  where we all know have the highest concentration of immune system components in our bodies. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2387.04s)]
*  So it's the perfect place to create the synchronization of location. So think about, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2392.3199999999997s)]
*  think about this as it's a brand new device that has absolutely no utility for anything. You don't [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2398.7999999999997s)]
*  want to lyse tissue in the body. You want to, you want to oblade it and a margin of healthy tissue [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2402.88s)]
*  around it to have a, have a positive effect in, in, in focal tumor therapy. So lysing a small part of [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2407.92s)]
*  it doesn't, doesn't do anything for anybody except in our therapy. You want to infuse a drug in, in, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2414.08s)]
*  in relatively high volume into, through that, through that conduit, that's going to, going to [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2419.76s)]
*  take the, the lytic debris and wash it out into the draining lymphatics. And then you have a four [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2426.0s)]
*  component large molecule co-formulation. Other than that, this is really easy, right? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2432.7200000000003s)]
*  Real simple. Yeah. Real simple. Real, real simple to explain. Real, real simple to take to the, the, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2439.1200000000003s)]
*  the VC community as well. I mean, scientific challenges aside, you, you, you alluded to [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2444.88s)]
*  the business challenges, the regulatory challenges that the company faced. What, what did you know [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2451.92s)]
*  going in based on all your previous, previous experience, what did you know going in about how [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2457.28s)]
*  difficult a wall that was going to be to climb, to go out and say, Hey, you know, you've never seen [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2462.72s)]
*  this before, but you ought to give us a whole lot of money so we can keep moving this thing forward [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2468.2400000000002s)]
*  and go to the regulatory authority and say, Hey, you've never seen this before, but give us all the [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2472.32s)]
*  green lights, man, because we're, we're doing some special stuff here. What did you know going in? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2476.4s)]
*  And then what did you learn as you, as you lived it? Oh, it, you know, I knew going in that this [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2480.88s)]
*  was going to be one of the greatest challenges, not only that I had faced, but that anybody had [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2485.6800000000003s)]
*  faced in drug device combination development. I'm not aware of anybody who's done a, a multi-component, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2490.4s)]
*  four component large molecule co-formulation of any kind for any reason. So there was, there was [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2498.48s)]
*  that challenge. And at that time, when we started the business, there was no precedent for a [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2505.44s)]
*  co-formulation of any two, the monoclonal antibody checkpoint inhibitors. Now there is, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2510.96s)]
*  there's a PD-1, like three, a co-formulated product that has been FDA approved. So that, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2517.52s)]
*  that certainly helps. But back then, no. So investors looked at this and they, the guy said, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2524.08s)]
*  you're doing what with what? You know, and you know, and so we, we would show them the anecdotal [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2531.68s)]
*  clinical data and say, here's, here's the signal that's got us so excited. And it's not, it's not [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2538.7999999999997s)]
*  well-controlled data. It's, it's practice of medicine data. And it, it, it, it, it's very, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2544.96s)]
*  very hard to sit through, but look, the complete responses are there and they've been durable. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2550.72s)]
*  You know, the, the, the pioneer Jason Williams, Dr. Williams has patients out over a decade. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2556.08s)]
*  And you know, this has got us really excited, but all of that aside, we know we need to develop [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2562.16s)]
*  in a very rational and well-controlled way, a new drug and device. And we know how hard that is, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2567.9199999999996s)]
*  but we've done this before. We have, we've assembled the best team to do this. And we think [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2574.88s)]
*  the juice is worth the squeeze. The, the investment community was, was very incredulous. They, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2580.48s)]
*  and you know, you just have to keep kissing frogs until finally, you know, you get lucky. And we [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2592.08s)]
*  ended up funding the company through high net worth individuals, including ourselves, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2598.48s)]
*  without any, any classic institutional sponsorship to get to the data we have today. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2602.96s)]
*  So it was a, a, a, a unique sort of investment pathway in that we, we convinced very smart, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2610.96s)]
*  high net worth investors, but they also had the altruistic side of, Hey, they've done incredibly [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2620.88s)]
*  well, and they wanted to invest in things that could, could really help people. And this certainly [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2626.16s)]
*  checked those boxes off and they invested, you know, the institutions or high net worth individuals, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2630.88s)]
*  it's as much about the jockey as it is the horse. So they invested in the team and Chuck Link and I [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2638.7200000000003s)]
*  are being serial entrepreneurs, had some, had some credibility and we surrounded ourselves with an [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2645.92s)]
*  extremely credible world-class team that the investors appreciated. And then we brought in an [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2652.8s)]
*  independent board early on, we call it a public company ready board to further validate that we [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2657.52s)]
*  weren't crazy. And we're, we're, we're trying to keep our feet on the ground. And our lead independent [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2663.84s)]
*  director is Doug Watson, the former CEO of Novartis. And he was the chairman of Dendrion, the first [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2669.92s)]
*  immunotherapy company to get approval in prostate cancer. So an incredibly credible, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2677.84s)]
*  seasoned, big pharma executive that added a tremendous amount of adult in a room [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2686.0800000000004s)]
*  supervision, as he always does in a very kind and gentle way. But, but when the Oracle speaks, we, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2692.7200000000003s)]
*  we all stop, we're doing and listen for sure. We're not going to be able to do that. We're [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2700.2400000000002s)]
*  we all stop. We're doing a listen for sure. We also have Norm Schwartz, the, the chairman and CEO [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2704.7999999999997s)]
*  of Bio-Rad, a very, very large med tech company. It was very passionate about cancer therapy [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2713.3599999999997s)]
*  development. A public CEO who took the company as parents founded to over 15 billion in market cap. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2718.3199999999997s)]
*  And, you know, it's just a sharp dude. And then Jeff Cleland, a serial entrepreneur in biotech, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2730.32s)]
*  who is a, is a biomedical engineer, MIT trained and is on the executive committee of bio. So, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2737.04s)]
*  you know, he brought just a wealth of entrepreneurial experience to the board. And then [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2746.1600000000003s)]
*  a physician by the name of Joe Maroon, who's really a legend in, in big pharma. He's been on [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2752.1600000000003s)]
*  many big pharma boards, but also the, the, it was the former chair of neurosurgery at UPMC and [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2758.96s)]
*  trained most of the great neurosurgeons in the world. He's in, in up there in age, but [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2766.8s)]
*  looks like a young man and acts like a young man. And I, I was incredible DNA. He's, he's also the [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2775.6s)]
*  team doctor for the Steelers and the end, end, end, end, end. And super passionate about cancers [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2782.56s)]
*  and, and including a potential for this to ultimately go into GBMs and other, other brain [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2789.36s)]
*  malignancies. So we have a really correct board and that helped with the investors a lot. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2796.4s)]
*  We're, we're right in the middle actually of doing a crossover series A. So, which will be [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2802.96s)]
*  institutional and we'll set us up for an IPO once the market for IPOs reappears, which sooner or [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2810.96s)]
*  later it always does. So we're ready to go. We're out of it. We're all, all that stuff, but there was, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2818.24s)]
*  there was nothing easy about this project. That's for sure. Funding was tough. The scientific [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2824.16s)]
*  community was incredulous. The data looked too good to be true, which is an irony. You know, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2828.72s)]
*  when your data is good, people challenge it. When it's too good, they're really challenging. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2834.8s)]
*  How could this possibly be? And I had the same reaction when I first saw it. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2840.88s)]
*  So I was going to say you, you as, you know, you as recruited CEO had the same reaction. Now, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2847.04s)]
*  now you're, you know, you, you get your mind wrapped around it. You're sold on it. You decide [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2853.2s)]
*  you're going to invest in it and build a company around it. You've got to, you've got to face some [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2857.6s)]
*  of that same sort of incredulous reaction from the people who you want on your team. I mean, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2862.88s)]
*  both sides, when it, when it, when it came time to build the sync immune team and put a staff [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2867.6s)]
*  together, how did, how did you go about doing that? Given the fact that, you know, you've, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2872.4s)]
*  you've got to have obviously biologics expertise, device, drug, drug delivery, device expertise, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2877.52s)]
*  and then the combination of those two things, limited pool to fish in, I'm sure. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2883.92s)]
*  Indeed. So how'd you go about getting that team pulled together? And how did you go about, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2889.12s)]
*  you know, overcoming the skepticism that, that surely, you know, I mean, it's, it's a risk to [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2894.3199999999997s)]
*  join any startup. It's a big risk to join this one, right? It is, it is. No question. You know, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2900.64s)]
*  the percent of biotechs that, you know, make it are, is small. You know, the vast majority fail [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2909.2s)]
*  due to this or that. So it's a highly risky game, high risk, high reward game. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2918.08s)]
*  And folks signing up for that have to be cut from that kind of cloth. They have to have that [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2923.6s)]
*  entrepreneurial attitude and preference that, you know, they, they, they like the adrenaline, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2929.36s)]
*  so to speak, of being on the edge, because it is the edge in reality. We try and mitigate as [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2938.7999999999997s)]
*  best we can. It, it, it, Chuck and I founded the company and we brought our best and brightest from [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2944.64s)]
*  our former lives to the team. And, you know, that, that's incredibly helpful because [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2953.12s)]
*  you already know, you know, they're known entities, you already have the rapport, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2963.68s)]
*  you have the trust, you know, their strengths and you know, their, their developmental needs. So [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2967.44s)]
*  managing them is, is, is less of a learning experience and more of a, let's just get right [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2973.3599999999997s)]
*  to it. And, and they, you know, we're, Chuck and I are a known, known entity to them as well. So [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2978.8s)]
*  you can really hit the ground running. They were all very, very busy doing other things. So getting [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2987.36s)]
*  them, took some salesmanship for sure. And as entrepreneurship always does, and the, the, but [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=2993.2000000000003s)]
*  we did assemble a really phenomenal team. And the, the people you look for, I mean, ideally you would, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3001.04s)]
*  you would assemble a team where everybody has combination product experience. Everybody has [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3012.6400000000003s)]
*  both drug and device experience. And, and the way I try and describe drug device combination [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3017.52s)]
*  product development is a Venn diagram of three circles. And the, where they converge, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3025.92s)]
*  these three circles converge is the new therapy. So drug device combination product is really a [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3033.76s)]
*  new therapy. So the three circles are the drug, the device and the procedure, the all important [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3039.92s)]
*  procedure, because if the procedure doesn't go well, the drug and device aren't going to work. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3046.56s)]
*  If the device doesn't work, the procedure and the drug are irrelevant, et cetera, et cetera. The [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3050.88s)]
*  drug by itself doesn't work. So, so it's truly a Venn diagram. So, so every decision the development [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3056.32s)]
*  team has to make has to be in the context of that Venn diagram in that you can't just do what's best [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3062.88s)]
*  for the drug. It has to be what's best for the drug, but also works for the device and the [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3068.32s)]
*  procedure. You can't do what's just best for the device. It has to work for the drug and the [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3073.04s)]
*  procedure, et cetera, et cetera. Really challenging. So when you build the team, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3078.0s)]
*  you need expertise in all three of those, all three of those, those circles plus the, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3083.68s)]
*  the convergence, the therapy. So how many of those people exist on the planet? Very few. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3092.0s)]
*  So a lot of time you, you end up with people who are expertise in the drug, but really have, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3099.6s)]
*  very limited, if any experience in the other two circles. So you have to do a lot of education [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3106.0s)]
*  and vice versa for the device procedure team. Most device people have procedural experience [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3112.08s)]
*  because of the nature of devices. Very few drug people have procedural experience because of nature [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3117.68s)]
*  of drug delivery. So I, I, I having spent decades in, in combination product company leadership, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3122.48s)]
*  I have a canned presentation, educational presentation that I, I give to the team early on [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3134.48s)]
*  that, that, that explains how it all comes together and why, why drug people are what and how they are [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3141.76s)]
*  and how, why device people are what and how they are. So, you know, to, to, to distill it all down [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3150.72s)]
*  the Venn diagram. And then we go into, well, what, what, what's the average very successful [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3158.08s)]
*  drug person? What's their DNA like? Well, they have a lot of degrees. They've got, you know, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3163.44s)]
*  an M.B., PhD, M.O.U.S.E. They've got lots of letters after their name. And, and there's a [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3168.08s)]
*  reason for that. The reason is what's most important in drug development by far is the [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3173.84s)]
*  quality of decision-making because it's not an iterative process. Iteration is too expensive. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3180.88s)]
*  So you really need people who are, are incredibly well versed in, in analyzing complex data [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3187.52s)]
*  and distilling it all down to a decision that at least has a good shot of not crashing and burning. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3194.96s)]
*  But again, most biotech companies fail because the hypothesis failed. And that's with brilliant minds [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3201.04s)]
*  that are, have M.D., PhD, M.O.U.S.E. all over it, making phenomenally good decisions that turned out [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3208.4s)]
*  to not be correct. So tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars go down the drain [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3215.7599999999998s)]
*  because your hypothesis didn't work and you can't, can't iterate. Now, now we look at the device [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3220.7999999999997s)]
*  world. In the device world, it's not about the quality of decision-making. It's about the speed [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3228.16s)]
*  of decision-making because it's all about iteration because iteration is cheap. It's way cheaper than [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3234.16s)]
*  time. So fail fast, fail fast, fail fast, learn, fail fast, keep going, keep going, keep going. And, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3240.32s)]
*  and that is the antithesis of a PhD or an M.D. or an M.D. PhD think thought pattern. It's so, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3247.44s)]
*  so when you put these very, very, and if you look at the degrees in the, in the device world, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3254.96s)]
*  it's typically not a lot of, not as many for sure, advanced degrees because it's more about do, do, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3260.6400000000003s)]
*  do, do, do, you know, make those a lot of engineers, a lot of, a lot of let's, let's do quick [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3268.0s)]
*  experiments and iterate. So when you, when you put these very disparate thought patterns together [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3272.8s)]
*  into an organization that has to seamlessly work together in this Venn diagram, it, it, it, it, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3278.88s)]
*  it's oil and water unless you educate them right away that there's a reason why your colleague [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3285.92s)]
*  across the, across the Venn diagram doesn't think like you do. So once, once the, you know, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3292.8s)]
*  if left to themselves, if the, the drug people would look at the device people and say, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3299.44s)]
*  you guys are just frenetic. You just run around with no data, just doing crazy stuff, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3304.2400000000002s)]
*  throwing it against the wall, see if it sticks and then move on, move on. You know, I, you give, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3309.6000000000004s)]
*  you give me heart palpitations just watching you do your thing. You, you talk to the device people [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3315.04s)]
*  about the drug people and they say, you know, you guys are like park statues. I'm surprised pigeons [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3320.64s)]
*  aren't landing on your shoulder. I don't ever see you move. You're just sitting there thinking all [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3325.04s)]
*  the time and not doing anything. But once you educate them that there's a reason for that [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3329.12s)]
*  thinking, because if you took a device mentality and put it in pharmaceutical development or [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3334.72s)]
*  biotech development, you would crash and burn really fast because you just, you can't iterate. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3339.2799999999997s)]
*  It's too expensive. It's tens of millions of dollars every time you change anything. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3344.64s)]
*  You've got to be right. So you, and if you take a, a drug person and put them in the device world, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3348.16s)]
*  people will have to feel with them because they're not making decisions fast enough. They're not [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3354.3199999999997s)]
*  iterating. They're making really high quality, too slow decisions. So there's, there's method [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3358.3199999999997s)]
*  to both that are, that is absolutely valid. And respecting that difference is the lesson of the, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3365.12s)]
*  the plan is that respect your colleague that they need to think like that and to support them in [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3373.92s)]
*  that need to think that way. You don't think that way. If you're in the device world, looking at the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3380.08s)]
*  drug world, you don't think that way. If you're in the drug world, looking at the device, you know, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3385.04s)]
*  just, but, but understand it, it's, it's, it's a thing that needs to be, and it isn't transferable. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3389.04s)]
*  And it works. You know, the, they're all smart people. They, they, they go, wow, you know, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3397.04s)]
*  I never thought about that, but she, yeah, that makes sense. And, and, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3401.68s)]
*  Yeah. I'll stop bugging them. The vice-president stopped bugging the direct people about getting, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3406.48s)]
*  you know, why, why are you, aren't you guys done? Would you, would you, is it a fair, is it fair to [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3410.7999999999997s)]
*  say that as, uh, like in, in your role as, as president and CEO, that some of the responsibility [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3416.48s)]
*  in setting that tone and achieving that understanding fall, falls on you like, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3424.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, management at its essence is about, uh, alignment [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3429.36s)]
*  and, uh, how do you get people aligned, you plan, and then how do you, how do you keep [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3436.7200000000003s)]
*  people on the plan? You, you interact, you know, and so, um, as CEO, you know, you're the, you're [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3440.7200000000003s)]
*  the penultimate manager. Uh, and I'm involved in that all day, every day, making sure everybody's [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3447.2000000000003s)]
*  aligned and, um, you know, the plans are in place and, and it's, it's, uh, it's a symphony, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3452.88s)]
*  you know, you've got to, you've got to conduct the orchestra because it's complex music for sure. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3459.6800000000003s)]
*  Is the, does that complexity and the, the need to, to, to, you know, to, to align, uh, fall outside [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3465.12s)]
*  the four walls as well? Like I've got to think that in a complex manufacturing environment, like [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3472.2400000000002s)]
*  the one you're in, you've, you've, you've got dependence on a little, uh, ecosystem of, of [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3477.6s)]
*  partners. So talk about that. Like how, I guess the base question would be, how is, uh, how, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3483.2s)]
*  how do the parts come together from a manufacturing perspective? Yeah. In, uh, in biotech, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3489.2s)]
*  the rule is you work with contract development and manufacturer organizations because the, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3495.28s)]
*  the technology is so rapidly evolving and, and so hyper specialized and so expensive for every [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3499.7599999999998s)]
*  company to develop internally that it's just impractical. So you're, you're, uh, you're [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3506.24s)]
*  partnered with a very, uh, vibrant and, uh, broad, deep, uh, uh, ecosystem in contract development [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3510.9599999999996s)]
*  and manufacturing and biotech in a device world. Uh, it's similar, but, uh, more flexibility. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3519.68s)]
*  Sometimes you can do it internally. Sometimes you, uh, you can't, uh, uh, but, uh, you know, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3525.3599999999997s)]
*  it truly is, uh, uh, a lot of managing of, uh, very hyper specialized, uh, vendors that, uh, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3532.72s)]
*  are, are doing, doing the work of the very, very complex work and keeping them all aligned because [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3541.7599999999998s)]
*  not, not any one of them has the whole picture. Um, they, the, the, uh, molecule, uh, the CMC folks, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3548.72s)]
*  uh, have no idea about devices, nor should they. Um, the, uh, the device folks have no idea about, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3557.12s)]
*  you know, the CMC, it's, it's, uh, coordinating it all and keeping it aligned is what the, the, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3562.56s)]
*  the management team does, uh, day in, day out. And then we do, we do have internal things that [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3569.36s)]
*  when we can and when it makes sense, um, you know, and it's just a regular kind of make buy, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3574.0s)]
*  you know, do we, do we, uh, do we internalize certain things? Sure we do. Uh, but vast majority [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3579.44s)]
*  is managing outside specialty vendors. Yeah. We, uh, we're running a bit short on time here, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3585.6s)]
*  Eamon, but you're good for a couple more questions. I am. I am. Yeah. All right. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3592.16s)]
*  You're going to a couple more questions and we're going to need to wrap things up and probably [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3595.6s)]
*  schedule a part two and perhaps a part three and perhaps a part four, because you're one of those [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3598.72s)]
*  interviews, Eamon, who like, you make the job, uh, you make the job easy for the interviewer. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3603.92s)]
*  I asked one, one questions and one question and it's like winding you up and watching you go, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3609.04s)]
*  which is great. Um, yeah, but the, so the third part of that Venn diagram, I'm a little bit curious [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3615.04s)]
*  about the procedural part. Um, what, what are the, I guess, what's the strategy, what are the plans [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3621.68s)]
*  for sort of clinical procedural application? Given that we're talking about, you know, a unique [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3627.9199999999996s)]
*  device, a unique combination of, of therapeutics, a unique, unique mechanism of action, multiple [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3634.3199999999997s)]
*  mechanistic elements to the, to the, uh, the drugs, uh, mechanism. So just give me some, I guess, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3640.7999999999997s)]
*  forward looking statements around what the plan might be there to actually execute in the clinic, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3648.72s)]
*  let's say beyond, uh, approval, beyond commercialization. How do we take this [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3654.96s)]
*  thing that no one's have, you know, practitioners haven't seen it before either. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3659.2799999999997s)]
*  Right, right. No, the procedure is as important as the drug or the device. And, uh, in the, uh, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3664.3199999999997s)]
*  in the clinical development program, the procedure is, is a tremendous, um, uh, aspect that has to be [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3674.08s)]
*  managed very, very carefully. And how we go about doing that is by proctoring, uh, every, every case [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3683.2799999999997s)]
*  in our clinical development program to varying degrees. So to get a site up and running, uh, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3689.84s)]
*  in a prostate cancer, uh, trial, for instance, uh, we need three PIs at every site. We need a, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3696.2400000000002s)]
*  we need a urologist, we need an oncologist, and then we need an interventional radiologist. And [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3702.6400000000003s)]
*  the reason for that is, uh, depending on the approach taken to treat the patient, either [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3707.6000000000004s)]
*  intra prostate or treating a MET, uh, the urologists are very skilled at treating prostates [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3713.2000000000003s)]
*  percutaneously. They do prostate biopsies all the time and, and brachytherapy and all kinds of things [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3719.68s)]
*  with trans rectal ultrasound approach and trans perineal, uh, access. So it's a home game for them. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3725.2799999999997s)]
*  Once we teach them the procedural aspect of it, the urologists can certainly do that. But if the [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3731.9199999999996s)]
*  patient doesn't have a prostate, they had just as metastatic disease, then, uh, the, uh, the MET has [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3736.64s)]
*  to be, a MET has to be selected for each cycle of therapy. And that's typically CT guided. And [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3742.56s)]
*  that falls outside of the typical skill set, uh, uh, for a urologist because they just don't have [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3749.52s)]
*  any need to be doing that. So we need the interventional radiologist at that point who [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3756.24s)]
*  that's a home game for them. They can access anything from anywhere, uh, with CT guidance, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3760.24s)]
*  uh, or any other guidance and doing needle biopsies all the time. So, uh, and then the [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3765.04s)]
*  oncologist is there to manage the, the complex, uh, post-op care that can, uh, be needed, uh, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3770.96s)]
*  because of the immunotherapeutics. We're, we're blessed so far in the clinical development [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3780.16s)]
*  programs that the, the, uh, toxicities have been grade one and two and, and, and, uh, very, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3783.84s)]
*  very low toxicities, uh, with really high efficacy, which is in itself, uh, uh, a paradigm change and [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3789.04s)]
*  been unprecedented. So, uh, but the oncologists are really the only ones with the skill set to manage [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3796.56s)]
*  immunotherapy, um, uh, uh, post-op and all the patient care required. So we need those three PIs. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3802.4s)]
*  So for every case, we've got those three PIs there and, um, uh, to varying degrees. So the, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3811.2s)]
*  the urologist is there, uh, the, you know, res radiologist is there and the oncologist is sort of, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3817.04s)]
*  um, uh, hovering, you know, over, over the, the procedural aspect, make sure they understand [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3822.88s)]
*  what's going on. And in the room, we, we have our own urologist, interventional radiologist, a, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3828.0s)]
*  um, search, uh, med surg nurse, uh, RT potentially, uh, dual, dual, uh, certified, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3835.6800000000003s)]
*  who really is a jack of all trades procedurally. And then we have an engineer who knows the [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3842.48s)]
*  equipment inside out case. There's a problem with the equipment and, and, and of course, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3848.0s)]
*  the first case it's a, it's a, uh, a C one where we have the proctors really, really helping, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3852.16s)]
*  you know, very, very, very intimate in, in, in instructing step by step by step. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3859.12s)]
*  So we're trying to get to the C one, do one, teach one scenario of, of procedural learning in medicine. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3864.88s)]
*  Yeah. So we, we keep, we keep the, the, uh, the urologist, the interest radiologist [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3871.2s)]
*  and the nurse and the, and the, and the, uh, the engineer there until the clinical teams, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3877.9199999999996s)]
*  basically doing it repeatedly without any real intervention. The, the, uh, urologist and the [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3885.52s)]
*  interest radiologist then go to another site to get that up and running the, but we leave the, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3892.64s)]
*  the nurse and the, uh, uh, the engineer there permanently. Uh, they're there for every case [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3898.56s)]
*  as backup. So if anything goes wrong and, and there are, there are, you know, it's, it's a busy, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3904.7200000000003s)]
*  busy place. You know, these are typically academic medical centers and the team might change, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3911.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, there may be a new, a new nurse or a new tech or a new, um, a new clinician who's, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3916.6400000000003s)]
*  who needs, needs help. So there, there's, uh, there's a reason for our folks to be there. One, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3922.48s)]
*  to recognize how well the team is trained and if there's swap outs, you know, to be alert to that [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3926.8s)]
*  and, and then get whatever we need there. Uh, but in clinical development, it's critically important [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3933.6000000000004s)]
*  to realize going in that Murphy is a, is a close family relative and Murphy's law is going to apply [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3938.7200000000003s)]
*  and what can go wrong will go wrong. So you've got to be there for every last case when there's a [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3944.7200000000003s)]
*  procedure involved. You may be standing, you're hoping you're standing in the hallway board [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3949.6000000000004s)]
*  because the clinical teams just crushing it and that, you know, that's a great problem to have. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3954.8799999999997s)]
*  But, um, and that happens until it doesn't, and then you better be there, uh, and, and keep, keep [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3959.68s)]
*  things going because running the clinic, everything in, in these development programs is best [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3967.04s)]
*  accomplished by doing it right the first time because the second time is incredibly expensive. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3974.0s)]
*  And, um, and you, the data you've generated poorly is now across the bearer that you have to, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3981.04s)]
*  you have to overcome with better, better data. So the best way to prevent, uh, to deal with problems, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3989.28s)]
*  prevent them from happening by being very, very attentive all the way through. So, um, once we get [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=3996.32s)]
*  to commercialization though, it's, um, and I've done this many times in my career, it's a similar [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4001.76s)]
*  situation, but, uh, we're not, we're not running clinical trials anymore. These, these are practices [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4008.56s)]
*  and it really comes down to see when do and teach one. And the good news is that urologists [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4015.68s)]
*  clinically, uh, know this, know this technique inside out. I mean, this is a, this is a, a meat, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4021.36s)]
*  meat, potatoes, uh, uh, foundational procedure for them. Same for the interventional radiologist, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4027.84s)]
*  same for the oncologist managing, you know, um, you know, therapeutic toxicities as their bread [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4034.56s)]
*  and butter. So it should be, it should be fine. And, um, uh, the, the, uh, the, the reason there's [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4039.52s)]
*  such a disparate difference there is when you're developing a new therapy, the, the most important [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4048.16s)]
*  thing is developing the new therapy. So patients can ultimately have broad, broad access to it. And, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4056.0s)]
*  and when you're treating a patient, the most important thing is that patient. So it's a very [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4063.68s)]
*  different, different world when you get out into the commercial world and you know, they're, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4069.2s)]
*  if they don't follow the protocol because it's in the best interest of the patient, well, that's, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4073.2s)]
*  that's the practice of medicine. And you know, that's absolutely appropriate. That's forbidden [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4077.8399999999997s)]
*  in clinical development. You got to stick to the protocol or, or, or have an amendment to the [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4083.8399999999997s)]
*  protocol because of a need. So you're really trying to do what's best to get it to millions [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4088.64s)]
*  of patients. And that can often, often, uh, you know, be a tough decision that the sponsor [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4093.84s)]
*  needs to be a part of. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Um, all right. So last question would be piggybacking [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4099.44s)]
*  off of that, uh, excellent detailed, uh, clinical illustration that you just painted, uh, what's next [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4106.24s)]
*  as far as clinical, uh, progress or milestones for synchromia. Yeah. We, we just announced, uh, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4113.12s)]
*  our, uh, next trial, um, I and D approval, uh, the FDA approved, uh, our trial. So we're, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4119.5199999999995s)]
*  that'll be at, um, starting at five sites in the U S or, uh, uh, planning on first patient in, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4126.08s)]
*  in, um, September and that's in metastatic cast metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4132.4s)]
*  Uh, we're, uh, uh, uh, that, that trial will segue right into a, uh, um, a, uh, phase two trial. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4138.8s)]
*  So it's a phase one B two trial now. Um, and the agency's given us that, that go ahead. So we're, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4147.92s)]
*  we're off to the races to, uh, that phase two trial will be registrational intent ultimately. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4154.8s)]
*  So, um, it, it, our clinical development pathways, um, laid out, we've, uh, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4160.0s)]
*  we've, we've got a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, we plan to add a basket trial for the drug we're having [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4167.52s)]
*  such great early success with in, uh, in prostate cancer, the basket trial and other, other [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4175.6s)]
*  malignancies, um, other cancers. Uh, and this follows the path that Merck and VMS took for [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4182.0s)]
*  Abdi Bo and Kichurda to expand the indications with a basket trial. And when you see signals, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4189.2s)]
*  you just go right to continue that trial to registration. Uh, so we're on a very well [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4194.24s)]
*  paved road there in parallel. We have another drug that we're pursuing for metastatic lung and [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4199.679999999999s)]
*  breast and that's, that's in phase one. Uh, we're, uh, we're very pleased with, with the progress [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4205.92s)]
*  there. Haven't announced anything yet. Um, it's, it's early, but, uh, uh, once, once, uh, uh, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4211.76s)]
*  that, uh, data is ready, uh, it'll go through a similar path that the prostate cancer did and [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4220.56s)]
*  hopefully we're ready to, um, uh, ready for next year's ASCO with the, uh, the, uh, uh, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4227.12s)]
*  that drug candidate in lung and breast, if not sooner, and that'll take on its own, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4234.400000000001s)]
*  own development pathway. So, uh, uh, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy. And, uh, you know, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4239.04s)]
*  we've, we've well ascertained the complexity of this drug device combination business, uh, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4245.36s)]
*  not for the faint of heart. It's clear to me after spending an hour plus with you now that your [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlwHzJxIQ0&t=4251.28s)]
