*  Mazur, co-founder, CEO, and chairman of Multimodal Biopharma, Sidious Pharmaceuticals. He's a guy who, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=59.2s)]
*  for more than 50 years, has been in the LifeScience business leadership role. He's got [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=67.12s)]
*  50 plus years in his rear view, and he just can't seem to stop. He's won and he's lost, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=74.88s)]
*  he's scrapped, and most recently he's bootstrapped to drive Sidious forward [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=79.44s)]
*  in its multimodal, multi-indication quest to address cancer, infection, ARDS, and more. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=84.56s)]
*  On today's episode, we'll gain insight into some of the lessons that Leonard's learned [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=91.92s)]
*  about highs and lows on his long journey as a biotech exec, and we'll get a glimpse into [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=96.32s)]
*  the mentality that's kept him motivated all these years. Leonard, welcome to the show. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=101.36s)]
*  It's a pleasure. Thank you for having me. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=106.4s)]
*  The pleasure's mine. We had the chance to catch up a couple weeks ago. I enjoyed every minute of it, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=108.48s)]
*  and I'm looking forward to picking your brain a little bit for the benefit of our audience. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Speaking of that conversation we had a couple weeks ago, I remember it started out with a pretty [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  profound and explicit statement that you made where you said, hey buddy, I didn't have to do this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=128.88s)]
*  I, and when I say do this, I mean co-found Sidious. So tell us, why did you? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=134.8s)]
*  What did you do it for if you didn't have to? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=144.96s)]
*  Well, I think you know what, I've always enjoyed having a challenge in front of me, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=148.16s)]
*  and I couldn't imagine continuing ahead without that. Not that you can certainly create them if [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=156.0s)]
*  you want to. And for me, being in a pharmaceutical business and industry has always been something [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=163.04s)]
*  I enjoyed. I have enjoyed every minute of being in this business. And that, you know, you can have [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=176.0s)]
*  as many challenges as you want in there, and it can be difficult at times, but you've got to really [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of the people that I associate with end of business, they actually have a passion for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=193.2s)]
*  the business. And a good number of folks that I've met are like that. So we have a unique industry [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=198.64s)]
*  in that regard. But the challenge is what I like, so that's why I did it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the challenge is that the, like what motivates that challenge? Is it, you know, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  is it the thrill of the hunt? Is it the degree of difficulty? I mean it's an incredibly difficult [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=218.0s)]
*  business. Is it, you know, is it the potential payoff? Like what, where's the motivation to want [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=222.4s)]
*  to? I don't know, something that I can see was the fear of failure. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=227.52s)]
*  I mean, if it were the fear of failure for most in this business, they check out in a hurry, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=234.16s)]
*  because failure is sort of the norm. Right, right. Yeah, I think, you know, I think [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=239.6s)]
*  you pick your challenges, of course. And, you know, I've had several experiences already starting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=245.28s)]
*  from zero. So when you start from zero, it's a whole different experience. And zero really means [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=255.04s)]
*  zero. So it's not like you suddenly have, you know, a big venture capital fund behind you. And, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=263.2s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of security there and so forth. But when you start from zero, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=271.44s)]
*  you're on your own and it's on your back and it's up to you to make it happen. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=278.4s)]
*  So with Sidious, I was fortunate also that there was a co-founder with me, Martin Halubiak, who [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=285.92s)]
*  used to be president at Roche Labs. I'd known him for a long, long time. And I think we always [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=292.72s)]
*  wanted to work together with each other. And finally, we created that opportunity. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. So give us a little more on the backstory of the founding of Sidious. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=309.04s)]
*  How did it sort of form up? What did it evolve from? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=316.16s)]
*  It evolved from a conversation, actually discussions that we had. And then [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  it led to, we had one product opportunity that someone had presented to us that was [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=325.12s)]
*  very late, late, late days, almost approvable in some ways. And so what we did is we went out there [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=333.52s)]
*  and saw, tried to see if we could get some capital raised for it. It just did not work out the way we [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=345.6s)]
*  thought it could. So then what happened was I had had some previous experience and contact with [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=354.72s)]
*  MD Anderson on a drug that they were working on at the time. At one point, I had incubated [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=365.6s)]
*  a dermatological products company that acquired, we acquired Minicent from Wyatt. And what happened [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=375.04s)]
*  was, which was an acne product, it was an antibiotic for acne. So we had a dermatological [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  company with derm cell force and everything that was trucking along really nice. And about a year [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=395.76s)]
*  after we did that acquisition, I get a call one day from the Department of Defense. And they said [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=403.36s)]
*  to me, they said, we're contacting you because we are treating soldiers that were wounded in Iraq [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=409.92s)]
*  and Afghanistan in a hospital in Germany for a certain type of bacterial infection with [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  minocycline IV. And we can't continue the treatment here because the drug was pulled [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=427.84s)]
*  off the market a number of years ago. What happened was Wyatt had the Minicent IV out there with the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=435.76s)]
*  regular, with the capsules as well, but they launched another hospital-based antibiotic. So [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  they didn't want to have two, so they dropped it. So his request to me was, can we bring that drug back? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  And I said, first of all, I said, we're not even a hospital company, we're a derm company. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=456.32s)]
*  Yeah. And we have no expertise in that end, no coverage, nothing. And he begged me to see [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=462.64s)]
*  if we could do something. So I thought, all right. I sat down at that time, I had a partner, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=471.12s)]
*  I had a partner, he passed away. But he and I sat there, we discussed it. I said, look, let's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  do the right thing here. Let's do this out of loyalty. It's not out of profit or anything [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  like that. I'm certainly not going to make any money at this thing, but let's see what we do [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=496.0s)]
*  to bring it back. So we did have, we were fortunate, we had a good regulatory person in our staff, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  and it took about a year and we got it qualified. I mean, to get all this set up was complicated. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=505.6s)]
*  It had overseas sourcing, it had all kinds of issues. So then what we did is we put two people [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=511.36s)]
*  on it. That's all to cover hospitals. Okay. This is so absurd, but nevertheless, we did that. And [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=517.6s)]
*  at one point I noticed we're getting a lot of revenue out of MD Anderson. So Guy arranged to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=526.24s)]
*  go down and I meet with the chief of infectious disease, Dr. Issam Ratt, and I find out that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=531.84s)]
*  they're not buying a drug to treat anybody. They were buying it, they were doing experiments. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=536.96s)]
*  He was trying to come up with something that would work for infected catheters. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  And so early on, there was nothing I could do with it. So basically what happened was ultimately, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=551.84s)]
*  we sell off the Derm Company and everything, and then a couple of years go by. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=556.24s)]
*  And so Myron and myself go down to MD Anderson and we meet with Dr. Ratt and we found out that he [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=560.64s)]
*  had really evolved this drug or his concept and what he was looking for, because he was experimenting [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  with a bunch of different antibiotics. So he was already getting ready to go into the clinic. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  He had something that they thought would work with minocycline in it. And so we funded the phase two [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=583.12s)]
*  B work. That's how we got started. And it was only because of the fact that that drug came back the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=591.76s)]
*  way it came back, that he was able to do that. But that was kind of the beginnings of the company. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=598.88s)]
*  So it was interesting. It was taking a chance on something way back, not even taking a chance. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=606.08s)]
*  We did it not for taking a chance. We did it because of patriotism, loyalty. I served under [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  US Marine Corps reserves. So anything for people that are willing to fight for their country, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=622.48s)]
*  if we can do that, let's do it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=630.24s)]
*  Yeah. Exemplary illustrative of your willingness to take on a challenge. Thank you for your service, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=631.6s)]
*  by the way. As I understand it, you served in the Marine Corps many years after you emigrated to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=639.5200000000001s)]
*  the United States from Germany. Is that correct? Yeah. So yeah, we thank you for your service. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's a compelling story. I wanted to ask you a few questions about the funding of cities, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=654.32s)]
*  because I know you've got a lot of your own skin in the game. So at what point in that, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=662.6400000000001s)]
*  Cronall, you said you funded the phase two B study. Was it around there that you started [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=667.2s)]
*  investing in your own? Yeah, that's where we started. We started putting our own money in. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=672.4000000000001s)]
*  Basically, we funded a good part of that trial. And then we realized that we needed to have [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=675.5200000000001s)]
*  external financing as well, because it would take a significant sum of money to get there with it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=684.16s)]
*  So that's when we raised some money privately. But for the most part, what we did is there was [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  a public entity called Cityus that I knew about. I had a relationship with the people there, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  worked with them at one point, even had a minor role inside the company. So [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=705.92s)]
*  we merged in with them. They were public. And then ultimately what we did is that was 2016. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=711.52s)]
*  We did an up listing to NASDAQ 2017, roughly. And we had a great investment, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  good investment bank that we worked with to help us raise capital, the agency Wainwright. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=731.5999999999999s)]
*  And we started our journey really in that regard then. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=737.12s)]
*  Yeah. You've led quite a few life sciences companies over the years, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=742.32s)]
*  pharmas, biopharmas, and beyond. I want to kind of dig into how having invested your own skin in the [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=748.16s)]
*  game, having invested your own money into the company, how that sort of affects the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=759.2s)]
*  in a couple of different contexts. One, how it affects your, I guess, what's the impact on [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  your decision making, like your leadership of the company? Well, I look at it like this. I think [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=776.24s)]
*  when you bring a team together, we had a very small team, I mean, very small team. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=783.3599999999999s)]
*  And it lasted that way for a while. It got no bigger than about six people. And you know them [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=789.92s)]
*  all, you know everybody really, really well. You know what their capabilities are. We have a great [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=798.4s)]
*  CFO. So that really helps a lot because his attitude and the way he ran things, it was like [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  his own money was there. So, and that, again, that helps an awful lot. You've got to have somebody [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=817.2s)]
*  that can control that cash for you and highlight for you if there's a potential issue or something [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=826.32s)]
*  that you need to be thinking about. And we were always conscientious about what our forward [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=835.5200000000001s)]
*  obligations were looking like and what we needed to take care of that. We always wanted to make [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=842.8800000000001s)]
*  sure that we had sufficient cash reserves in the company to be able to go out for one year and [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  beyond. So, and that was always a guiding principle for us. And we ran things that way. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=854.72s)]
*  So, it's because if you, I was very accustomed to running a revenue producing company. That was [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=865.6800000000001s)]
*  my real experience phase, doing acquisitions of revenue producing drugs and managing a business [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  in that fashion. When you get into the research based side of this world, it's totally different [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=883.28s)]
*  because you don't have that constant, you can't turn the spigot on and all of a sudden, here comes [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=890.48s)]
*  a flood of revenue. You can't do that. It's not there. In fact, what's happening is the water is [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=896.48s)]
*  slowly being drained out of your cash. All right. Your cash is like a water, like being in a bathtub [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=903.68s)]
*  and pull the plug and it's going down. So, you need to be conscious of that all the time. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=910.96s)]
*  Yeah. When you, your first experience with that, you know, that phenomenon, like we're a cash [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=918.48s)]
*  spending company, not a cash making company. How did you mentally adjust and what advice would you [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=925.6s)]
*  have for founders and startup execs who are seeing that for the first time? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=933.6800000000001s)]
*  I have to admit, I had a hard time with it, psychologically. And I really had to adapt to it. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=938.32s)]
*  It was not easy at first and then ultimately, I think I recognized that, okay, so this is something [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=949.5200000000001s)]
*  else that you manage, but now I got to manage it the other way around. And for me, what it was, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=957.7600000000001s)]
*  the raising of capital became the revenue. So, I had to, we had to raise capital and we had to [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=964.8s)]
*  keep that revenue flow going. So, that was the equivalent of that. So, I kind of, that's how I [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  rationalized it in my own mind about it in terms of management. And it's not an easy thing to do, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=979.8399999999999s)]
*  especially if you're really accustomed to P&L. I was so grounded in those principles. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=986.56s)]
*  The P&L, your P&L is your burn rate here. So, you've got to really be really, really on top of it. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=995.28s)]
*  Yeah. Did you find yourself, I mean, you've got experience over the years in business development, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1004.7199999999999s)]
*  obviously working for for-profit companies that are revenue generating, there's the business [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1010.88s)]
*  development sales aspect. Did you find yourself applying principles and confidence in your [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1016.0799999999999s)]
*  business development experience, applying that to fundraising? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1021.52s)]
*  Yeah. Business development is really critical. Business development, I added the dimension that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1026.0s)]
*  I added to business development was capital raising. Business development. All right. So, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1032.0s)]
*  I recognized pretty quickly that the earlier stage you were, the lesser the probability of [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1039.76s)]
*  getting anything done with a partner, with a big company, with a big pharma company or anything, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1047.92s)]
*  or out licensing or trying to do something like that, that that was not really in the cards [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1054.24s)]
*  for the time being. And so, consequently, my business development activity centered on [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  raising capital more than anything else. And that took the same business development principles that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1069.68s)]
*  I had elsewhere. And ultimately, what that evolves into is relationships become really critical, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1076.88s)]
*  they're really important in terms of capital raising. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1085.92s)]
*  When you say relationships, are you talking about like direct relationships with [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1091.68s)]
*  the investor community or are you talking about relationships? Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1096.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You've got to have that because it's amazing when you're able to finally get to the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1099.84s)]
*  point where you've gained the confidence of your banks. If you have confidence from the banks, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1109.6799999999998s)]
*  they will raise capital for you. I'm not saying no matter what the circumstances, but [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1120.9599999999998s)]
*  it's a significant aspect of this is to be able to really have a good relationship with your bank. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1128.3200000000002s)]
*  Thanks. What was there? That was the sort of the other general context I was curious about in terms [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1137.3600000000001s)]
*  of you having your own money invested in the company. Is that view to sort of a feather in [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1144.96s)]
*  your cap as a pro from the investment community? Are they more or less likely to want to jump on [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1152.0s)]
*  board when they see that you're- I think it means a lot to investors when they see that you've done [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1159.44s)]
*  that. They know you've got skin in the game and you're willing to, in fact, a good number of the [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1164.64s)]
*  raises that we did, I went in side by side with the funds that we're putting money in. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1174.88s)]
*  And I think that the fact that I was willing to do that really helped us. It helped us get there. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1184.8000000000002s)]
*  It really helped advance us. It gave a lot of people confidence. It gave our bankers for sure [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1192.5600000000002s)]
*  a significant confidence. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1199.2800000000002s)]
*  Is that confidence rooted in their understanding that you have a faith or belief in the molecule? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1203.1200000000001s)]
*  Is it more rooted in their understanding that, hey, this guy's going to treat his money right [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1211.2s)]
*  and our money right because we're in this together, both? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1217.1200000000001s)]
*  It's a combination. It's a combination of the fact that they're trusting your judgment, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1220.88s)]
*  your business judgment, and your judgment about the potential for the company and their belief [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1230.4s)]
*  in your ability to execute it is important, really important that you can deliver. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1236.64s)]
*  At the end of the day, we have to deliver. This is a results-oriented business. And the end of the [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1244.24s)]
*  day, an approval is the capstone of what you're doing. You've got to deliver that. And we know [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1253.52s)]
*  that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1264.08s)]
*  We know that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1264.56s)]
*  Do you find yourself managing in a more perhaps frugal or conservative fashion [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1268.56s)]
*  in this business than perhaps than you did in a revenue-generating business? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1276.6399999999999s)]
*  No. I consider myself a risk taker. I always look at the world. There are risk takers and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1282.1599999999999s)]
*  risk aversers. And the vast majority of people are risk aversers. But there's a percentage of us, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1290.32s)]
*  we're risk takers. So I'll never forget, somebody gave me this statement one time, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1298.56s)]
*  a saying that said, unless if you're not living on the edge, then you're taking up too much space. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1307.6s)]
*  I always found that fascinating. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1317.6s)]
*  I like that. Yeah, I like that a lot. And yeah, I mean, it's not lost on us that you need to be a [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1321.28s)]
*  risk taker in this business. Because like I said, failure is the norm. And you've taken, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1327.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, Citius has taken steps with its pipeline, I think, to, I guess, temper failure. We'll talk [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1333.9199999999998s)]
*  about that in a minute, the pipeline and the strategy there. But knowing, how do you reconcile [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1342.08s)]
*  being a risk taker in a business where failure is so common? This is the part you said, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1349.52s)]
*  you said something about psychoanalysis. This is the part where I psychoanalyze you. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1357.2s)]
*  I'm well aware of what the statistics are here. And there is a high failure rate. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1365.44s)]
*  It's like wildcat drilling for oil. And you're going to come up dry and you're going to hit it [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1370.96s)]
*  also. So I think what we try to do is really manage it by virtue of the fact that the asset [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1378.16s)]
*  that we've chosen to work with here, take the one that we licensed out of MD Anderson, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  and we really went further with that. We took it deeper and deeper as, because they had a good [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1403.04s)]
*  data set. They had a phase 2B trial that looked really great. And with that, we thought we could [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1410.6399999999999s)]
*  bring this to the market and get it ultimately approved. So I had a lot of confidence in that. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1419.04s)]
*  A lot of confidence in that. Same thing with when we got Lynch Beer. Here was a drug that was on [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1428.4s)]
*  the market once and had been taken off the market by the ISI at the time, because they had a [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1443.6000000000001s)]
*  reformulation requirement from the FDA to remove some unfolded proteins. So basically, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1452.64s)]
*  and they didn't have enough inventory to go either way, both ways. So they decided to pull [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1460.0800000000002s)]
*  it off the market, complete the reformulation, bring it back to market. And the FDA asked them [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1466.16s)]
*  when they did that, they came back with the results. They said, this is a new drug. You've [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1470.96s)]
*  got to do a phase three study with 71 patients in a lead-in trial. So what happened was when we got [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1476.24s)]
*  to that, when we got to the point of where we were on a buyout of that license, they were on their [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1485.84s)]
*  very last patient on a phase three trial, last patient in. And I really believe, I thought for [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1492.64s)]
*  sure, and I'm still maintaining it'll happen, is that this is approvable, that since it's got a [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1502.96s)]
*  history to it, it was on the market, it had acceptance when it was on the market. It's a very [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1509.92s)]
*  rare disease. It's not going to require a giant investment to go out and market it. So there were [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1516.64s)]
*  attributes about it. And one of the other attributes that it had a very unique mechanism of [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1525.76s)]
*  action. So basically what we try to look for is, if at all possible, is the uniqueness, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1532.8s)]
*  uniqueness of what we're working with. That's another aspect. Miniloc, our antibiotic lock [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1541.6799999999998s)]
*  solution from Andy Anderson, is a very, very unique product. There's nothing like it on the [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1547.6799999999998s)]
*  market, nothing being studied. So that again is another attribute in terms of, at least from my [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1554.16s)]
*  point of view, the risk taking side can work in your favor. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so these are unique [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1562.88s)]
*  candidates you've mentioned so far are unique in that, for instance, they were on the market, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1571.8400000000001s)]
*  then pulled off the market, needed to be reformulated, so on and so forth. Do you look [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1576.64s)]
*  for those unique opportunities or is it more serendipity? We do look for them. People are [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1580.4s)]
*  always contacting you with opportunities. So when they know you're in a business, they come in over [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1593.68s)]
*  the trance more or less. So every once in a while, there comes one that's really worthwhile to look [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1598.4s)]
*  at. Yeah. I wanted to ask you some questions about the pipeline, but we're kind of there right now. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1609.28s)]
*  So I'm going to bounce around a little bit here. But while we're talking about that pipeline [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1615.84s)]
*  strategy and the variety of it, you've mentioned some antibiotic products. You've got a stem cell [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1618.96s)]
*  therapy product in the works, several different modalities that you've, and indications, I mean, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1628.3999999999999s)]
*  is a broad swath of indication. What's the strategy there? So I should mention that some of these, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1636.48s)]
*  sort of what happens here is we do get into it, but then when we get into it, we make a decision [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1644.4s)]
*  not to take it much further. So the stem cell product at the moment, we're not really devoting [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1650.32s)]
*  any significant resources there because of what we learned after we got into it. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1658.0s)]
*  More or less, just put a hold on it for the time being until we see if there's any further [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1666.72s)]
*  developments. But in terms of the broader sort of strategy, even the fact that you took a flyer on [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1674.64s)]
*  that, like took a look at it and shelved it for a little while, it sort of fell outside the norm [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1683.44s)]
*  of where you lived. Is there a strategy behind that? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1689.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there is. So basically, once you know, either way, it's a go or no go, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1692.96s)]
*  be a big boy, make up your mind about it and say, okay, we're stopping. And sometimes [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1704.24s)]
*  your ego should not get in the way of that whatsoever. You've got to keep it out of that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1712.4s)]
*  But you know, I've seen that in the past, and that's a very bad driver at times. So [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1718.4s)]
*  you get to the point, you've got information, you've got good information, act on it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1728.64s)]
*  Is the ego that you mentioned, when you say your ego, do you mean at the leadership level? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1736.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, anybody's ego, correct. I've seen those mistakes. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1743.92s)]
*  I've had conversations with other execs who have talked about when they decide to either go or [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1749.44s)]
*  more often than obviously no go, like if they no go a project and there are specific people [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1754.96s)]
*  at the research or director level on that project, there's ego there too, right? Like it's their baby. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1760.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1765.1200000000001s)]
*  How do you manage them away from their egos? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1769.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not easy. It's not easy because it gets emotional. And once emotion gets attached to it, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1774.24s)]
*  look out. When it comes to turning your innovations into clinical realities, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1783.44s)]
*  the first step is transforming your process. On the Business of Biotech podcast, we bring [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1789.6000000000001s)]

*  manufacture and delivery of therapeutics. Check out the resources at Cytiva.com backslash emerging [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1810.6399999999999s)]

*  Yeah. You also told me when we talked a couple of weeks back, you made a comment about this [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1823.6s)]
*  business being entirely different, completely different operation than it was 10 years ago. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1831.12s)]
*  I want to dig into what you mean about that. Like did you mean this business meaning [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1838.0s)]
*  the specific business that you're involved in and running, or do you mean the business [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1842.32s)]
*  in the sense of the greater industry? Well, I think both. There's evolution on both sides [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1847.44s)]
*  of both of it. Basically, start with our company. We went from six people to, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1858.08s)]
*  we're at 22 people right now. All right. And somebody will say, hey, well, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1868.0800000000002s)]
*  there are other people, other companies have thousands. What are you talking about? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But that percentage increase, that equates to something. That percentage increase equates [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1878.5600000000002s)]
*  that. And all the people that we brought on board are all professionals. It's not like we've got [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1885.28s)]
*  four secretaries in here, or four mid-level. We don't. They're all high caliber professionals [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1891.52s)]
*  and in various disciplines. So when we were at six, we didn't have that. We contracted everything [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1899.2s)]
*  out in terms of expertise and it was managing consultants more or less. But now it's actually [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1907.76s)]
*  managing that effort itself and with your own staff. And that's very different compared to [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1915.6s)]
*  where we were. So that was our evolution. But the industry itself, I've seen this industry go [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1923.92s)]
*  through, I think it's gone through changes. It used to be, for example, spec pharma. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1932.4s)]
*  You don't even hear that anymore, that term. Spec pharma was hot. All right. Buying revenues, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1943.44s)]
*  I'm talking about, if you think about the Valiant model and what they did, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1951.12s)]
*  all right, and others as well. So there was a cadre of people operating in that universe. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1955.6s)]
*  Then one day it all dried up. It all dried up financially, completely. That whole segment [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1962.6399999999999s)]
*  of the market just disappeared. So almost. So on the biotech side, that's even had, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1970.08s)]
*  I think biotech will always have the same principle going forward. And that is that [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1980.6399999999999s)]
*  it's very high risk because a lot of it is very early stage and you're investing in some basic [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1986.32s)]
*  scientific breakthrough concept that you've got to recognize, you've got to put the money up to [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=1997.12s)]
*  take it all through that whole preclinical side to get it to a point to get it into the clinic. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2005.44s)]
*  And so that universe is really bifurcated. Those that are on the preclinical side, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2011.76s)]
*  those that are in the clinical side and those that are in between. So it's not even bifurcated, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2018.3999999999999s)]
*  it's tri-fricated. So that side has not changed an awful lot. At least that's my perception. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2024.8s)]
*  I think what happened here also is that it's probably the financial side is where the pressure [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2036.08s)]
*  points have evolved. And that is that the capital raising for the earlier stage companies was a lot [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2042.48s)]
*  easier five years ago or longer, maybe a little bit longer. And there was, I think a lot of new [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2052.96s)]
*  companies got created in that process. All right. Now the rubber is really starting to hit the road [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2060.96s)]
*  in here and the capital is not that easy. Forget about the IPO flow, forget about it. It's low, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2067.84s)]
*  nowhere near what it was. So there's changes there and it's cyclical. So that part of it is [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2078.8799999999997s)]
*  another aspect of this. Whether people want to admit it or not, there's a cyclical aspect to what's [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2087.8399999999997s)]
*  going on more in that world than I would say in a pharma world. Yeah. Yeah. As far as the investment [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2095.2s)]
*  cycles are concerned and the fact that money is harder to come by now, do you find Sidious in an [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2102.3199999999997s)]
*  advantageous position given the fact that you don't have giant gaps in your pipeline, for instance? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2108.4s)]
*  You've got a late phase three candidate that has some challenges, but we'll address it in a minute, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2114.4s)]
*  but it's getting there. Does that put you in an advantageous position? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2122.08s)]
*  No, we're absolutely in an advantageous position as a result of that. There's no two ways about it. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2126.32s)]
*  So we know we can knock on a door. The only word everybody's concerned about for us is dilution. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2131.04s)]
*  But we know we can access capital because of our portfolio is as advanced as it is. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2143.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Advanced and like I said, without giant gaps. And I want to talk about some [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2154.0s)]
*  of the highs and lows in recent months. So just this summer, you guys reported good phase three [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2161.28s)]
*  clinical progress and favorable data on your late stage candidate, Minolok? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2168.8s)]
*  Minolok, right. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2174.88s)]
*  Minolok, yep. And then in short order, received a CRL letter on another on Lymphir. So I guess the [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2175.92s)]
*  general question where I'd start with this one would be like, what advice, I mean, you've got a [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2186.08s)]
*  lot of experience with these things. You've worked with the FDA for a long, long time. You know, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2190.32s)]
*  what's coming down the pike. What's your advice to folks who maybe haven't seen some of those [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2194.88s)]
*  ups and downs in terms of navigating the company through them? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2198.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I wish I could say that I was able to discern the FDA in this matter, all right, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2202.48s)]
*  accurately. All right. I wasn't. All right. And what happened with us is we had, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2218.96s)]
*  we actually had positive indicators, including, let's say, within a month of that [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2228.8799999999997s)]
*  CRL letter, which was a month before the FDUPA date, we had, we were already engaged in a process [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2236.7999999999997s)]
*  for negotiating the labeling, package insert, full disclosure, all that. And usually in that process, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2244.24s)]
*  the experience, folks will tell you, that's a great sign that you're on your way to an approval. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2251.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, it didn't happen that way. So we did have, we had a gap. We had one thing that was not in [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2256.96s)]
*  that filing and it had to do with manufacturing, a manufacturing test of all things on a final [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2267.04s)]
*  finished product. So we had a test that was completed, but had not been validated. And the [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2275.04s)]
*  validation would not be complete until the end of, let's say, end of October, their vows. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2284.08s)]
*  So we thought the FDA was going to give us a conditional approval. And basically with the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2290.96s)]
*  condition that that validation test be completed, well, they chose to give us a CRL. So in their [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2298.72s)]
*  infinite wisdom, whatever. So that was very, very disappointing to the FDA. And we had to [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2305.2s)]
*  to all of us. But we had to move on and we adapted very quickly to that situation. We're [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2314.56s)]
*  confident we're getting this drug approved. So it's for rare cancer and it definitely will save lives [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2324.56s)]
*  or extend people's lives, I should say, over time. So that, it should be, it will be approved. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2332.96s)]
*  What is that course correction? I mean, CRL, the letters happen. I've talked to plenty of biotech [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2343.44s)]
*  execs who have muscled their way through these things. But what does that course correction [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2350.4s)]
*  look like from your purview, like from your office? What do you have to do as a leader [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2354.5600000000004s)]
*  of the company to maintain that course correction? Well, I think, first of all, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2360.8s)]
*  you got to keep everybody should be, continue being highly motivated, because [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2366.96s)]
*  I like to look upon myself as sometimes when I'm asked what I am. So either I'm the company [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2377.52s)]
*  philosopher or the company cheerleader or maybe both. All right. So basically, it's important to [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2383.52s)]
*  maintain that your staff, your team has the same attitude that you have, that you're [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2390.0s)]
*  enthusiastic, you're positive, you're going to overcome what this is about. And you have to [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2399.52s)]
*  respond very quickly to the FDA, get back to them with your plan, what you're going to do, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2405.92s)]
*  how you're going to do a resubmission. So that's what we're, we jumped very quickly on that. And [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2412.08s)]
*  we got a response back from the FDA that indicated they're in agreement with what we're doing. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2422.4s)]
*  And so we'll be resubmitting somewhere towards the end of the year, beginning of the year, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2428.4s)]
*  somewhere in that timeframe. And then the FDA will give us a new pa-dupa date. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2435.12s)]
*  So we'll see what that looks like then at that time. But it's, you know, psychologically, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2442.16s)]
*  initially when you get hit with it and you weren't expecting it, it's a blow. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2451.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's things. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2459.92s)]
*  You just took a punch in the mouth. All right. And you better step right back and get back in [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2462.24s)]
*  there. And you can't dwell on it too long. I don't like dwelling on anything like that. So [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2467.92s)]
*  you just got to move ahead. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2477.76s)]
*  Yeah. From a business, like an operation standpoint, is this something that you [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2479.36s)]
*  like financially are prepared for or do you end up, or is it a combination of, you know, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  trying to be prepared for financially and also turning some levers and dials to make adjustments [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2494.0s)]
*  to see it through? We're looking good on the financial side. So plus the cost of what that is [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2500.4s)]
*  is not going to affect us at all in terms of the financial side. Not as if, you know, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2506.56s)]
*  we had no, our clinical side is clean. Basically that's been accepted. There's no side effect [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2511.44s)]
*  issue. None of that. It's all of a sudden, if you suddenly have to repeat a clinical trial or [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2517.6s)]
*  something like that, that's an issue. That's a real issue. But this, not to say it's not an issue, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2522.8s)]
*  but you can basically overcome it efficiently. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2529.52s)]
*  Is there any specific advice you would give a young first time biotech exec to, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2539.76s)]
*  like I said, either prepare for it, either organizationally, financially, or psychologically? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2547.04s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think you have to be, you know, in our business, you got to be prepared for these [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2553.28s)]
*  moments they happen. And also what that really teaches you is that [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2559.36s)]
*  if you have a single product company, that is, that's the riskiest position of them all. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2568.6400000000003s)]
*  So, and we were fortunate that we were able to bring this asset on board in fear to really [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2577.28s)]
*  help defray that, you know, the risk that's there. So we're in a much better position as a [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2586.32s)]
*  result of that. And we were a single product company actually for the longest time. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2593.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2599.36s)]
*  So, and I always, even though I felt confident about it, I just, I was never comfortable with [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2599.6s)]
*  the fact that it was a single product company for the most part. Even though, you know, you can talk [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2607.2000000000003s)]
*  about those other assets, but that was the principal one. That was it. So, and look what [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2613.92s)]
*  happened, COVID came along and delayed our clinical trial. So as a result, bringing something else, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2621.6s)]
*  it worked out that, and by the way, it was not an easy process for us to get that asset. We had to [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2631.04s)]
*  go through an auction process. So, and that had its own set of characteristics. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2637.52s)]
*  I've not heard that. I mean, you know, that's new. Is that somewhat, is it a relatively common [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2645.76s)]
*  practice? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2652.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, if good assets come on board or become available to you, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2653.44s)]
*  and a banker brings it to you or a broker, usually it'll be an auction process. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2660.7200000000003s)]
*  And you like to stay away from them if you can. And you'd like to see if you can't go out there [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2668.16s)]
*  and find something ahead of that auction process, if you can. So, but an auction process is an auction [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2676.24s)]
*  process. It's real interesting. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2684.24s)]
*  Do you continue to drug hunt, so to speak? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2690.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, we do. So we have a full-time BD person on board with us. So, and he's out there [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2694.4s)]
*  all the time looking at things. So, you just, sometimes, it's been my experience in the past, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2703.0400000000004s)]
*  if you could get there by yourself without having to do the auction, you're much better off. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2711.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2716.88s)]
*  You can negotiate a deal on your financial terms as opposed to suddenly the auction [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2717.44s)]
*  dictating what those financial terms are. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2725.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2729.12s)]
*  That's a different story. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  What's, what is the update on the clinical pipeline today? Like, you know, obviously, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2731.76s)]
*  we just discussed Lymphyr and Menoloc a little bit. Like, what are some of your [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2738.96s)]
*  next immediate steps in clinical progress? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2742.48s)]
*  With Menoloc, we're more or less at the end of that. We're getting to the end of that trial soon. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2745.44s)]
*  So, we'll have, what we did is we expanded that trial into India to bring it across the finish [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2753.28s)]
*  line quicker. So, and that process is underway. It's an event-driven trial. So, and the event is [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2760.88s)]
*  a negative event and that is the time to catheter's failing, time to catheter failure [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2770.72s)]
*  as comparison of our LACS solution to what I term a home brew that the hospital mixes up. So, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2777.3599999999997s)]
*  what happens is with patients that have infected catheters is the standard of care is to remove [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2785.7599999999998s)]
*  the catheter and replace it with a new catheter. So, and usually what happens is [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2794.24s)]
*  initially the catheters are placed inserted subclavically by the collarbone. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2801.4399999999996s)]
*  When it has to be, it's surgically implanted. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2809.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2812.72s)]
*  It gets threaded to the heart. So, if that catheter gets infected, they have to remove [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2813.04s)]
*  it surgically and then they have to replace it surgically. And usually, though a lot of times, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2819.28s)]
*  the new catheter is placed down by the groin. It gets threaded up. There's about a 20% [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2826.96s)]
*  adverse event profile associated with it. So, what happens in a certain number of certain [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2832.32s)]
*  percentage of cases though, there are patients that no longer have access points that can be [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2838.0s)]
*  used for a replacement catheter. The hospital will mix up, I call it a home brew, an antibiotic [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2844.24s)]
*  solution that will try to salvage that catheter if they can. So, that's what our trial is being [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2852.64s)]
*  compared is all about. So, our goal is 92 events. We've crossed the 92 event line, but we're taking [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  it over in order to give us a better margin in terms of on a statistical side, just to make sure [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2869.92s)]
*  that there are no issues on the patient counts when we get there. So, somewhere in the course of [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2878.08s)]
*  somewhere in 24, we'll have a top line data readout on this and then we'll go to the agency with the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2885.36s)]
*  data. Yeah. Very good. Are there any... So, we talked about the stem cell product sort of [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2891.36s)]
*  being shelved for now. Are there any other candidates that beyond these two that are [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2899.84s)]
*  not shelved or potentially... We have one that's a little bit, I call it Farro Field, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2906.1600000000003s)]
*  and it's a hemorrhoid drug. Yeah. So, that's something when we merged in with Cineas, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2910.88s)]
*  they had in their portfolio. So, it's a legacy drug. We weren't going to keep it initially, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2917.28s)]
*  but we took a good look at it and we realized something. In the 21st century, there isn't a [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2923.44s)]
*  single FDA approved prescription drug for the treatment of hemorrhoids. It's hard to believe. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2930.4s)]
*  That is hard to believe. And you have the over the counter market that have products like Preparation [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2937.28s)]
*  H, but that's Preparation H can handle grade one hemorrhoids, not grades two, three, four. So, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2943.2000000000003s)]
*  we thought, all right, since they were working on a formulation that they had, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2952.0s)]
*  that it could be a category, if we don't spend a lot of money on it, that if we can prove some [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2957.52s)]
*  efficacy, we can sell it off to a major player because I think the market potential is gigantic. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2963.68s)]
*  There are several main patient visits to the doctor's offices annually in the United States [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2971.9199999999996s)]
*  for hemorrhoids. But this requires somebody with a larger sales force, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2978.32s)]
*  direct to consumer advertising. It's not our model. So, we've been working with a formulation that [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2984.7200000000003s)]
*  it contains Halo Betazol, which is a fluorinated high-potency steroid combined with lidocaine. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=2993.84s)]
*  We've just completed recently a phase two B trial that looks positive. We're going to go to the FDA [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3000.2400000000002s)]
*  with it and work out a phase three protocol. If the phase three protocol has a number of patients [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3007.44s)]
*  that makes it really economical for us to execute on it, we will in order to put it in a better [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3018.32s)]
*  position for ultimate license or sale to a pharma partner. So, that, like I said, is far afield from [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3024.64s)]
*  those other two drugs. Sure is. Yeah. And that's what I mean. When I look at the pipeline and these [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3034.16s)]
*  candidates, the indications are far and wide. The modalities are far and wide. Does that create [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3041.7599999999998s)]
*  challenges for the business in terms of you've got 22 people, highly disciplined professionals? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3050.08s)]
*  Are they just, they're multi-adapt? Yeah. It doesn't matter what the drug is. So, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3056.08s)]
*  okay, they're pros. So, it's easy to handle. Let's put it that way. Yeah. Good deal. All right. Well, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3062.32s)]
*  I know we're getting short on time here, Leonard. I want to be respectful of your time, but I do [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3069.92s)]
*  want to ask you about another thing we talked about, another person that we talked about in our initial [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3073.84s)]
*  conversation. You told me a couple of stories about one of the, you know, everyone's got a mentor, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3078.2400000000002s)]
*  right? Like you're probably a mentor to several people at this point, I'm sure, in your career [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3083.36s)]
*  and have been over the years. But you told me stories about Parker G. Montgomery, who is a man [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3089.6s)]
*  who, as I understand it, he's like a hundred years old. He's got to be- 93, I think, at this point. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3095.44s)]
*  Or 93. Yeah, close. You're 93 or a hundred. We'll round up. I mean, he's, but he was a big influence [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3102.88s)]
*  on you. Tell me, who is he and what impact did he have on you? He was the founder, CEO of the very [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3110.32s)]
*  first company where I worked. I was there for 10 years. It was called Cooper Laboratories. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3116.8s)]
*  He made 150 acquisitions. All right. I want you to think about that. 150. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3123.2000000000003s)]
*  Think about that requirement, what that was like. All right. So, and I, you know, what happened was [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3129.04s)]
*  I started out in the sales side and I got promoted after about a year and a half to being a market [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3137.92s)]
*  research analyst. And a short period after that, I found myself, you know, putting deal [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3145.2s)]
*  presentations together. I was in, I got, at one point, I got promoted overnight from being a [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3154.0s)]
*  product manager to being responsible for strategic planning. And it was done by, believe it or not, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3162.72s)]
*  it was done by him. We were all at a, at a, at a strategic planning meeting into Poconos then. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3169.04s)]
*  And, and it was on the, Cooper had invested in a small eye care company [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3176.88s)]
*  that was doing like $10 million in revenue. And Parker wanted that business to really [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3184.56s)]
*  get up there and become a hundred million dollar company quickly. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3189.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, I, so, so during that session, what happened was at one point, he just turned around [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3192.7999999999997s)]
*  and said, okay, Leonard, you're now, you're no longer going to be in marketing. You're going to [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3202.4s)]
*  be in strategic planning. And I want you to come back here in 90 days. I want to plan on how we're [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3207.84s)]
*  going to get to a hundred million dollars. And at the same time, he said to me, he said, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3215.84s)]
*  you're also going to do all your boss's paperwork because he used to do paperwork. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3221.6000000000004s)]
*  So that was, that was, that's how it was. Okay. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3230.0s)]
*  This was a different day and age. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3235.92s)]
*  But it was a great opportunity for me because I did, I put together a whole strategic plan on how, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3240.8s)]
*  how to develop that business. It got ultimately, it was called Cooper vision. It went from 10 [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3245.12s)]
*  million to 600 million, the world's largest diet care companies at that time. It was, it was, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3252.0s)]
*  and I worked on the beginning of it. And then I got assigned to, I set up a dermatology company. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3259.2s)]
*  Uh, uh, we had a vino as our, uh, our principal, uh, uh, drug back then. Uh, so I witnessed [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3267.12s)]
*  firsthand, I'll give you an example on something. I witnessed firsthand how, uh, it was a great [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3276.56s)]
*  growth story. The company acquires a tiny little toothbrush line doing less than a million dollars [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3283.2s)]
*  in business at the time. Yeah. RLB. Yeah. RLB. It became the world's largest selling toothbrush. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3290.8s)]
*  Yeah. I remember Cooper vision. What, what became of Cooper vision? What's the what? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3299.52s)]
*  What became of Cooper vision? Today it's part of the Cooper companies headquartered on the west coast [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3305.04s)]
*  within that company. So, uh, it's a very significant player and it was the, it was the [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3310.0s)]
*  right market segment to be in at that time. That specialty was exploding with technology. And, uh, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3316.24s)]
*  uh, the, the company went out, we bought everything in sight. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3323.3599999999997s)]
*  Fakery, multiplication, IOLs, uh, had the very first extended wear, uh, contact lens called [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3327.7599999999998s)]
*  permalens on the market. And, uh, you know, and Parker was a risk taker. He was not a technical guy. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3335.04s)]
*  He had, uh, he was a Harvard law, Harvard undergrad was an assistant to the, uh, secretary of state [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3342.7999999999997s)]
*  at one point. Uh, and he started the company himself. He was a real entrepreneur. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3349.9199999999996s)]
*  So, uh, which is incredible, you know, he, he was really the one who, who pioneered, uh, deal making [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3357.04s)]
*  in a way it was done way back in those days. So, uh, I just, I had to hand it to him. You know, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3365.28s)]
*  I, I'll give you an example of, uh, how, how that risk taking side worked with him. So, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3374.32s)]
*  cause I was part of the group that was doing the evaluations. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3380.48s)]
*  So what happened was, uh, they, the company had this extended wear technology, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3384.7200000000003s)]
*  but it still had to go through a phase of FDA testing. And all the outside advisors that came [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3390.0800000000004s)]
*  into Cooper told Parker and the company, don't do it. You'll never get it cleared through the FDA. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3398.1600000000003s)]
*  So what happened was, uh, Parker had a science, full-time science advisor, uh, on staff [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3407.2000000000003s)]
*  and he was a PhD brilliant. And he told Parker, take the risk. You'll miss, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3415.6s)]
*  will pass after all these outside experts that'll never pass. Yeah. So, uh, and he said, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3422.24s)]
*  okay, we're doing it. We're going to go. All right. It worked. It got approved. So, uh, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3428.56s)]
*  and I saw that happen several times with, uh, with him. He was, uh, uh, like I said, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3436.16s)]
*  it was not a technical guy in at least bit, but he knew who to lean into. Right. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3443.84s)]
*  He did. He did. So, uh, but that company was a great experience for me. It was the kind of [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3449.12s)]
*  place where, uh, you had no training. There's no training. There is just, this is it. Here's [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3455.36s)]
*  your assignment. Go. Yeah, that was a great place. You know, if you're, you're a young person, you're, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3464.4s)]
*  you're eager, you want to, you know, so, and they gave it to you. They gave you every opportunity [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3471.92s)]
*  to book. I mean, you know, cause you know, I've been, I interviewed people that come out of the [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3478.8s)]
*  large companies today and they tell me they don't even know who they, you know, they don't even [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3482.8s)]
*  interact with the vice president of marketing, let alone the CEO of the company. But you know, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3486.48s)]
*  we had to give presentations to the CEO and the entire company all the time. Yeah. And, uh, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3490.56s)]
*  you grew up that, you know, you grew up very quickly in those, in that kind of an environment. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3496.56s)]
*  Yeah. A great place to be. And, uh, for me, he was, he was really, he was the best. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3501.2s)]
*  You talked about, is it a follow-up question on that? Cause you know, you, you, you cut your [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3508.24s)]
*  teeth back then and learn sort of the, the principles of risk taking in a, in a, you know, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3511.4399999999996s)]
*  decidedly CP, you know, consumer facing, consumer packaged goods industry. Uh, now, you know, to [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3516.24s)]
*  your point about the, the hemorrhoid, um, the hemorrhoid candidate, you know, the intention would [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3522.3199999999997s)]
*  be to take that and give it to someone who knows that business does that. So you've made quite [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3526.96s)]
*  over the years, you've made quite this transition into, you know, the, the biotech business, which [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3531.44s)]
*  is, which is not consumer facing. Is there like in your risk analysis, uh, and, and risk approach, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3535.7599999999998s)]
*  is there any nuance like between what you learned early on and this business that we're in now in [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3543.04s)]
*  the biotech space? Is it, is it different? Is it more challenging like weighing those risks? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3549.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So basically we did, by the way, that company was a prescription [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3555.92s)]
*  products company also. It had, well, so it wasn't just the consumer package, but so, so yeah. So [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3559.2s)]
*  basically, you know, uh, uh, I, I think, uh, this environment, the biotech environment compared to [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3566.64s)]
*  that environment was, uh, that, uh, the company was still bottom line managed, financially managed [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3575.2799999999997s)]
*  because it was public. It had to report quarterly earnings. So, uh, you had to be, uh, uh, you had [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3582.4s)]
*  to be very conscientious of it. As a matter of fact, I'll tell you something interesting. The [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3590.0s)]
*  thing that, uh, when, when, again, when we were, when I was a product manager, with Parker Montgomery [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3593.44s)]
*  insisted upon that all the product managers have detailed knowledge about cost of goods. He wanted [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3599.36s)]
*  everybody to know how cost of goods were calculated, what went into that formula and, and, uh, and all [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3608.7200000000003s)]
*  the elements of it, the overhead element, all that from an accounting side. And again, you know, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3615.6000000000004s)]
*  talk to, you've talked to marketing people today, they won't, they want to, all they know is just [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3622.8s)]
*  the line item to them. Doesn't mean anything. That's not, it's not how he viewed it though. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3627.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. It was good for us. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3632.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it sounds like an amazing experience to, uh, like I said, I mean, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W38YIgXFnA&t=3634.72s)]
