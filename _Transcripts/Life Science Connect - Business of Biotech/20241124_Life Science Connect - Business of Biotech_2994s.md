Video Description: The notion that political influence has no place in biology appears poised for a test it hasn’t studied for. Trump administration nominations, from RFK, Jr. to HHS and Vivek Ramaswamy to the newly-proposed DOGE, are driving a storm of speculation over the implications for biotech and other life sciences industries. Throw in the increased probability of the Biosecure Act seeing the light of legislation day under a republican congress, and there’s no shortage of biopolitical pontificating to be done. How might this all play out, and how should biotech builders be obviating? On this episode of the Business of Biotech, we’re joined for some reflection by none other than Allan Shaw.

# Biopolitics With Allan Shaw
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [November 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE)
*  Welcome back to the business of biotech. I'm Matt Piller and on the heels of a US election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=0.0s)]
*  that promises to have a significant impact on the biotech and biopharma industries. I'm [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=9.44s)]
*  geared up for a conversation on what might come to pass after inauguration day with none [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=15.6s)]
*  other than the Renaissance man of biotech himself, our dear friend, Alan Shaw. Alan, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=21.76s)]
*  welcome back. It's great to see you. Thanks a lot, Matt. Always great to be here. Great [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=27.52s)]
*  to see you. And I always enjoy the collaboration. Sure. Yeah, me too. And this is this this promises [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=32.32s)]
*  to be an interesting conversation because this is a this is a situation that is unfolding [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=38.16s)]
*  in real time as we speak. And everybody's talking about it. And who better to chat with [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=43.04s)]
*  about what might be coming down the pike than you? These impacts that we could be looking [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  at on the heels of the twenty twenty four elections, they're going to have, you know, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=56.52s)]
*  at least seemingly right. There's the writings on the wall that there's a lot of change coming [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  in life sciences industries and in the general public health space as well. So I want to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=70.28s)]
*  I want to start broadly with with the impact, potential impacts that is on public health. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=76.68s)]
*  If you look at the last Trump administration, you know, it it's clear that they were frequently [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=83.24s)]
*  at odds with NIH during covid. There's a general consensus in the incoming administration that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=89.16s)]
*  the NIH contributed to an erosion in public trust during that time. The NIH is a bulwark [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=95.72s)]
*  in the research community and a lot of money gets funneled through it. So any volatility [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=103.16s)]
*  much less potential funding cuts are understandably met with concern. And I'm seeing a lot of that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=109.64s)]
*  concern online in conversations with folks in the in the biotech space. So let's start with that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=114.28s)]
*  Let's start with the NIH. What's what's your observation? What's going on there again in the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=121.48s)]
*  context of what might what might come after after Inauguration Day? No, it's a good point. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=126.92s)]
*  And, you know, it's certainly an emotional period of time. And when the absence of good information, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=135.72s)]
*  there's certainly a plethora of speculation out there. And I think sometimes people get [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=140.44s)]
*  lost in the weeds. And I think, you know, certainly it's important to focus on the big picture. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=146.6s)]
*  And while it may be fun to speculate, you know, it may not be so fun when we're living the reality. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=152.44s)]
*  But to your question, the NIH plays a critical role in driving innovation, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=159.0s)]
*  particularly in funding early stage research that private industry typically avoids. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=164.04s)]
*  It's a gap that they fill. And any instability in its leadership policy or funding [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=169.0s)]
*  could disrupt this vital innovation pipeline, especially in areas like vaccine development, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=174.92s)]
*  cancer research, and infectious diseases. And the challenging funding environment, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=180.28s)]
*  cuts or polity shifts would be detrimental to the progress we've made. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  The you know, with that said, the perception that the NIH's public trust has eroded during COVID [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  complicates these efforts, while rebuilding the confidence in the institution. With RFK Jr.'s [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=196.76s)]
*  pending appointment, there's both potential for positive change, his calls for transparency [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=204.2s)]
*  and accountability could help restore public trust. And risk given his controversial stance [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  in vaccines and public health, his leadership may introduce a little bit of volatility, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  or redirect priorities, adding uncertainty to a ready fragile landscape. You know, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  but I think it's hard to dispute that the NIH's role is indispensable. And bipartisan support will [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=229.72s)]
*  be key to ensuring its focus remains on science driven, nonpartisan health advancements. In the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  end, maintaining stability at the NIH is essential for safeguarding long term innovation [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=244.04s)]
*  and public confidence in healthcare. Yeah, it's interesting, you know, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=250.28s)]
*  you talk about that erosion of trust. There's like, you know, we saw it in the election, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  there's, and I'm painting with a very broad brush right now. But there's a split, right? There's a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=262.2s)]
*  giant population of consumers and people and American citizens who distrust, perhaps, the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=270.28s)]
*  science and or the scientific advice, the health advice that's coming out of federal agencies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=279.55999999999995s)]
*  And then, you know, on the other hand, you've got this giant swath of people who distrust [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  the appointment of nominees who distrust science, right? Like how you talk about bipartisanship, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=292.92s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know how you reconcile, how you bring these two camps [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  together. And now that these camps are, you know, at least seemingly, and these are nominations, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=308.44s)]
*  right? Like we can acknowledge that these are nominations. RFK Jr., he's been nominated, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=312.68s)]
*  has been confirmed. You know, you look at Vivek Ramaswamy, right? Like he's been nominated or he [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=317.08s)]
*  and Elon Musk have been appointed to, you know, create a new entity that's designed to slash [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  government inefficiency. Vivek Ramaswamy has a lot of opinions on FDA inefficiency, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=332.68s)]
*  These things haven't necessarily taken effect yet, but I'm just curious about your take on the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=338.84s)]
*  likelihood that bipartisanship in a Congress that's controlled by Republicans under a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=343.72s)]
*  Republican president is even an ideal, an ideal that we should take seriously. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's certainly you touch on the vicious virtual cycle that feeds on this [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  and you get nowhere. You know, I would, you know, I think in some respects, you know, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=366.44s)]
*  we've grown accustomed to stagnation in Washington because of the gridlock that we've seen between, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=374.6s)]
*  because the idea of bipartisanship has taken a vacation. But I would say that, you know, with, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, the recent changing of the God, you know, there seems to be [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  more of an ability that you can get things done without the gridlock if people can [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  figure out a way to row in the same direction. Just because you're in the same political party, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=408.92s)]
*  it certainly seems to appears to be that it's while you're wearing the same jersey, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=414.44s)]
*  you know, you're running different plays, you know, you could be on the field running a pass [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=419.88s)]
*  play while the other guy's running, doing a running play, you know, it's not going to work. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=425.64s)]
*  Yeah. If you're, let's just assume for a moment, let's just, you know, put your mind in a role [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=429.56s)]
*  where you're leading an early stage research company that perhaps historically would be the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=438.6s)]
*  beneficiary of NIH funding to conduct its research. Are you concerned right now? Like, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=448.2s)]
*  are you worried about potential slashes to that funding? And if so, what do you do? Like, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  what's your playbook? You know, it's hard to worry about something that hasn't happened yet. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=465.08s)]
*  I mean, I think you do always want to try to avoid being single threaded in any sort of financing [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=472.28s)]
*  strategy that you have. So I do think it's beholden on leadership of organizations to try to find as [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=480.52s)]
*  many different pockets of funding resources. I think it's always fundamental about expanding [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=490.2s)]
*  the investor base. I think you're never done expanding an investor base. So this is [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=495.32s)]
*  and may be a challenge right now. It's all speculation. I think the bar is going to, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=502.12s)]
*  you know, the metrics and what is being used to allocate resources are going to be reevaluated [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=508.28s)]
*  and it's unclear what those priorities are going to be. So I think good science at the end of the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=513.88s)]
*  day trumps all no pun intended, but, you know, so I think with good science, you'll find it, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=522.12s)]
*  but I do think there's an issue, general issue that in terms of funding innovation, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=530.52s)]
*  if you don't have necessarily the right pedigree of folks behind you from the beginning as you [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=537.64s)]
*  form your capital formation, it becomes harder to attract that so-called smart money, fundamental [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  money later on. So and in programs that are on sexy, such as infectious diseases, you know, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=554.52s)]
*  the whole issue about antibiotics is a crisis waiting to happen at the end of the day. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  That's not getting attention. So, you know, the NIH is going to have to play, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=571.4s)]
*  as I said, step in where private industry is unwilling to step in. So an important role here, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=576.52s)]
*  you know, and as a friend of mine says, the pendulum never stops in the middle. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=582.68s)]
*  So, you know, I think the question is making sure it's properly calibrated, you know, not who's to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=587.16s)]
*  say that the level of funding today is the right amount. What's our return on it? What's been the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=592.5999999999999s)]
*  success on that? What's the accountability on that? So the points raised by the critics, you know, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=597.8s)]
*  they're fair points, you know, it's about right sizing things. And I think what we as a government [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=604.1999999999999s)]
*  or as a process is we kind of just take whatever's been approved in the past and now view that as an [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=609.48s)]
*  entitlement and then we just layer on more things. You know, I think it's always good to practice a [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=615.88s)]
*  zero-based budgeting approach as opposed to just assuming that, you know, what was done last year [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=622.04s)]
*  was the right thing and we're just going to build on it. Yeah. I just brought Vivek Ramaswamy up out [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=628.36s)]
*  of left field. I just want to remind my listeners and ask you, Alan, did you know that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=634.68s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy was my guest on episode six of the Business of Biotech podcast, episode six in the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=641.0799999999999s)]
*  summer of 2020? Wow. Back when he was still leading Roy Vant. No, that's an interesting [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=647.2399999999999s)]
*  trivia question. You should have gotten him to sign the podcast or something. I should have. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=660.2s)]
*  You might just imply that I gave him the platform. I mean, he's the first presidential candidate that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=666.76s)]
*  I was connected to on LinkedIn. Yeah, same. Yeah. First presidential candidate I've ever [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=672.76s)]
*  interviewed. I can say that for a fact. Let's talk about the CDC. The new administration is hinting [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=677.88s)]
*  that it would like to split the CDC into two distinct divisions, one focused on health [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=686.52s)]
*  surveillance around infectious disease and the other independently focused on public health [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=692.76s)]
*  recommendations. And it's made clear that it wants to draw a stark line between these two departments. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=699.3199999999999s)]
*  What do you see playing out there? If that were to come to pass, what implications should we be [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=706.12s)]
*  looking out for? Splitting the CDC into two divisions, one for health surveillance and the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=710.2s)]
*  other for public health recommendations could address criticisms of its dual mandate and help [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=717.24s)]
*  streamline operations. By focusing each division on its core function, the CDC could become more [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=722.5200000000001s)]
*  agile with surveillance arms dedicated to tracking outbreaks and trends and the recommendation arm [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=729.32s)]
*  focused on public guidance and policy. The upside could be a more transparent and accountable CDC, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=736.52s)]
*  potentially restoring public trust. However, this split could create challenges. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=743.3199999999999s)]
*  Close collaboration between the two divisions will be crucial to ensure swift coordinated responses [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=749.24s)]
*  during health crises such as COVID. Without it, there's a risk of mixed messages or slower [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=755.16s)]
*  reactions undermining the CDC's credibility, which they actually did during COVID nonetheless. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=762.44s)]
*  If executed well, this restructuring could strengthen the CDC, but it will require clear [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=770.36s)]
*  communication and strong leadership to ensure the agency's mission stays unified, protecting [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=775.72s)]
*  public health. Therefore, it might be easier said than done. Conceptually, I do see the merits of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=780.9200000000001s)]
*  it. Or maybe I can say I understand the merits of it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=788.76s)]
*  Scott Fiesen Yeah, I think the public and industry, I think the public and industry concern [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=792.36s)]
*  would probably, I'm just speculating here, but would probably lie more on the public health [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=801.88s)]
*  recommendations side of that reorg. Do you see any potential negative implications for industry? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=807.64s)]
*  Around a split like that? Or is it too early to say? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=818.76s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly I think it's a little too early to say. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=822.04s)]
*  You know, I think you want the group to be functioning well. You know, I think misinformation, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=826.68s)]
*  poor coordination. We've seen what happens when that occurs. And slow responses, we leave it for [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=834.28s)]
*  people to making up their own rules as they go. And since it's the sandbox we all in [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=843.56s)]
*  playing, I think it's important for it to be functioning well and is obviously collateral [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=850.8399999999999s)]
*  impact. But you know, as it could impact the industry directly at this point, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=857.0799999999999s)]
*  I think there's too many variables. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=864.28s)]
*  Scott Fiesen Yeah, yeah. So just for the benefit of our audience, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=865.7199999999999s)]
*  we're recording this on November 15. This episode is probably going to drop like towards the end of [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=871.08s)]
*  the month. And this situation is so fluid that when I prepared some questions for Alan, I was [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=877.0s)]
*  speculating on the potential nomination of an RFK junior to one of these agencies. And in the time [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=887.0s)]
*  since I drafted some questions for Alan, which was like a day and a half ago, RFK has indeed been [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=894.76s)]
*  nominated for the position to head the HHS. So two days ago, I didn't really take that [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=901.72s)]
*  potential, that speculation that was going on in the media that, you know, could RFK potentially [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=911.16s)]
*  become the head of the HHS. I didn't really take that seriously. Well, then I saw that Trump [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=915.08s)]
*  nominated Matt Gaetz to be the attorney general and I was like, well, anything could happen. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=920.2s)]
*  And indeed he has nominated RFK junior to head the HHS. So I'm interested in your perspective [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=926.44s)]
*  on that. He's had some very, you know, and maybe a lot of this might just be media bluster, you know, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=935.24s)]
*  they fool us all the time. But he's had some pretty lightning rod opinions around vaccines [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=941.1600000000001s)]
*  and fluoride and water. And I thought, well, you know, maybe that influence, whether he's nominated [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=949.88s)]
*  or not, has already started to shape the Trump administration's take on what it's going to do [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=956.52s)]
*  with the HHS. Now that he's nominated, it's solidified, right? That his influence and his [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=963.88s)]
*  stance on some of these controversial topics is certainly influencing the administration. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=971.56s)]
*  What do you think about this? Like, what do you think about the potential of his influence on [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=978.44s)]
*  the HHS, given, like I said, some of those controversial stances that he's made? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=986.76s)]
*  Now, RFK is certainly a polarizing individual and his potential appointment to lead the HSS [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=992.36s)]
*  is a significant development. You know, I think if you listen to folks, most people thought that the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=999.48s)]
*  chances of that happening was highly, highly remote. So it just goes to show that literally [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1007.1600000000001s)]
*  everything is on the table. And his appointment signals the administration's openness, in my view, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1013.32s)]
*  to challenging traditional health policies. You know, the status quo isn't going to work. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1019.32s)]
*  I remember when I was younger in my more formative years as an auditor at one of the big four firms, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1024.8400000000001s)]
*  I remember sitting my staff down at the beginning of each engagement and I'd ask them, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1033.56s)]
*  why did you order to cross the road? And they'd look at me like I had five heads and I said, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1037.24s)]
*  because they did it last year, like night and closed day. So, you know, I think, you know, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1042.92s)]
*  challenging things is an important part of evolution. There's always potentially a better [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1047.88s)]
*  way of doing things. So while RFK's Senate confirmation is uncertain, his views on vaccines [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1053.16s)]
*  and fluoride have already begun to shape public health conversations. You know, his possessions [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1060.6s)]
*  resonate with segments of the public calling for more cautious alternative health approaches, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1066.36s)]
*  which could push for greater transparency and debate on vaccine policy and environmental health. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1071.7199999999998s)]
*  Even if he doesn't land the role, his influence is already sparking a broader discussion [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1078.52s)]
*  around vaccine acceptance, environmental chemicals, public health and discussions around food. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1085.8000000000002s)]
*  His presence has undoubtedly expanded the discourse and his views will likely continue to influence [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1092.92s)]
*  the administration's public approach on health, for better or for worse. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1099.0s)]
*  Do you think, so, you know, again, painting with a broad brush and painting and only black and white, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1104.44s)]
*  you know, there's the perception that's out there that, hey, bottom line, RFK Jr., bad for pharma. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1110.84s)]
*  What do you see as the potential upshot? I mean, you know, there's no question that there's plenty [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1122.1999999999998s)]
*  of room for improvement and change in the space in terms of health outcomes. And I don't want to [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1127.24s)]
*  go too deep in the weeds here, but what do you think his influence might lead to around the [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1136.12s)]
*  discourse that could be upshot for industry, for the pharmaceutical industry? That right now is [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1145.1599999999999s)]
*  probably looking at this, like, you know, hey, if the people at the top are like downplaying the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1151.7199999999998s)]
*  necessity or value of vaccines, again, with a broad brush, that's bad. That's bad for business, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1157.8s)]
*  right? Like, what's the upshot? You know, if you're talking about, you know, using vaccines as an [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1165.8799999999999s)]
*  example, you know, he has dialed back a lot of his rhetoric recently about vaccines. You know, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1172.68s)]
*  he certainly said that he was going to take things off the market. You know, he was talking [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1182.2s)]
*  about better disclosure. That's a little unclear what that means. I think the data supports the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1187.48s)]
*  vaccines that are on the market. So that needs to be bottomed out a little bit. But I, my perception [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1193.56s)]
*  is it's a little, he may take a different stance, but certainly he has dialed it back. And maybe, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1201.32s)]
*  we'll see. But yeah, yeah. Being softer on that particular issue. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1209.8s)]
*  Yeah. And it is important to take all these things in context. I mean, we, you know, we just came off [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1214.6s)]
*  a campaign and campaign rhetoric never, I think it's safe to say it never, you know, parlay's to, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1219.24s)]
*  it never equates to reality post inauguration day. So we just need to remember that. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1228.6s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. But it would seem that at least based on the first couple of weeks [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1234.76s)]
*  that Trump is certainly posturing to deliver on all his campaign promises. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1241.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mentioned, again, I'll mention Vivek because I want to talk a bit about [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1247.56s)]
*  the FDA and he's been quite vocal about inefficiencies at the FDA. And he comes [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1254.12s)]
*  at that with a, you know, with a unique set of perspectives. He led multiple biotechs. He grew [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1259.8s)]
*  a biotech into a very significant player on the biopharma landscape. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1269.24s)]
*  So he's had firsthand experience with the FDA. And some of his suggestions around developing [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1273.48s)]
*  a more efficient FDA could be rather good for business, particularly for biotechs. You know, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1279.24s)]
*  he talks about excessive trials, you know, phase three trials. He talks about our [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1286.92s)]
*  inability or unwillingness to take, you know, other foreign agency observations and recommendations [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1294.44s)]
*  into account in our own approvals process, which seems counter to, seems counter to the [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1305.16s)]
*  globalization of healthcare. You know, so some of the things that I hear him talking about, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1311.5600000000002s)]
*  like I said, I mean, at face value, I think, well, these suggestions could actually be a boon [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1316.6799999999998s)]
*  for biopharma and biotech in particular. What do you think? What do you think about, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1324.28s)]
*  not just his influence, but the entire administration's potential influence on the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1328.12s)]
*  FDA? No, that's the big question is, you know, how's this going to affect us? And I think [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1332.1999999999998s)]
*  the FDA is the most logical place to focus on the collateral consequences of the new administration, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1340.6s)]
*  for better or for worse. A carefully chosen consequences word, yes. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1348.36s)]
*  With further definition. But I think what Vivek has highlighted are correct, broadly speaking, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1354.76s)]
*  you know, I think the devil's in the detail. You know, I think RFK's potential appointment [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1365.32s)]
*  to lead HSS could bring significant changes, particularly given his confrontational stance [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1370.4399999999998s)]
*  towards the agencies like the FDA. You know, his rhetoric about purging civil servants and [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1376.6s)]
*  ending what he terms the FDA's war on public health raises concerns about workforce instability, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1384.76s)]
*  especially when skilled expertise is crucial to addressing public health challenges, such as [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1391.8799999999999s)]
*  chronic health diseases. You know, that's not to be taken lightly. I understand there's a lot of [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1397.24s)]
*  open positions at the FDA. And, you know, that might become more acute. You know, political [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1403.08s)]
*  pressure has always played a role at the FDA in one form or the other. But these potential purges [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1410.12s)]
*  could amplify instability, jeopardize its ability to make science driven decisions. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1415.8s)]
*  While RFK junior supporters might frame this as a push for transparency and accountability, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1421.1599999999999s)]
*  the risk is that this could lead to overly politicalized decisions and reduce effectiveness [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1426.6799999999998s)]
*  at a time when the FDA is grappling with systemic inefficiencies. Beyond political concerns, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1431.9599999999998s)]
*  it's clear the FDA's clinical clinical development process for chronic disease is overdue for reform. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1439.24s)]
*  Legacy practices such as requiring large cardiovascular outcome trials after pivotal [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1446.76s)]
*  efficacy studies drive up costs and prolong timelines, creating significant barriers to [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1451.8s)]
*  innovation. This is particularly problematic for common chronic diseases like heart disease [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1458.52s)]
*  and diabetes, which remain leading causes of mortality and attract fewer investment dollars [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1464.68s)]
*  due to the high costs and risks of development. You know, this has recently changed the renewed [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1470.52s)]
*  interest in cardio metabolics and, you know, the weight loss drugs driving outcomes on diabetes. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1476.6000000000001s)]
*  But I would say, you know, the process that you have to run to get these drugs approved, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1483.16s)]
*  the costs associated with it do impact the ability of bringing drugs to market. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1490.52s)]
*  As noted by former FDA Deputy Commissioner, the agency's highly empirical statistical approach [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1497.8s)]
*  often results in overly large trials that serve populations broadly but fail to address the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1504.28s)]
*  nuances of treating individual patients. A shift towards a more flexible and conditional framework [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1511.24s)]
*  is needed, one that emphasizes smaller targeted studies with population subsets to hasten patient [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1517.8s)]
*  access to innovation therapies while de-risking the process. Leveraging real-world evidence and [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1525.24s)]
*  technologies like electronic health records could also improve efficiency and better reflect the [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1532.44s)]
*  actual patient experience. Ultimately, whether through political influence or systemic reform, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1537.56s)]
*  the FDA must address these barriers to innovation. Reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens would not [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1544.36s)]
*  only improve patient access to therapies but also encourage greater investment in tackling [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1551.64s)]
*  chronic diseases and areas that demand urgent attention. Yeah, yeah, we'll talk about that [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1557.3200000000002s)]
*  investment. That's another bullet point on my list of questions for you. Before I jump into that, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1564.68s)]
*  though, I want to talk about a political wave that was coming well before the elections in [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1570.3600000000001s)]
*  the Biosecure Act, but that being certainly poised for, I would say, potential acceleration post-election. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1578.76s)]
*  I've had a number of conversations off the record with heads of CMC at clinical-stage biotech [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1590.6s)]
*  companies who have told me that regardless of the outcome of the Biosecure Act, whether it passes or [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1598.68s)]
*  not, that the specter has been raised and their stakeholders, their investors, their boards, are [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1605.0s)]
*  profoundly concerned, deeply concerned about those companies' relationships with Chinese outsourcers. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1612.76s)]
*  Now, post-election with Republicans, as I said, in full control of Congress, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1620.2s)]
*  do you see that legislation being enacted as a foregone conclusion, the Biosecure Act? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1627.0s)]
*  The Biosecure Act has certainly been, to your point, raising a lot of concerns in the election. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1635.88s)]
*  Certainly, it would seem to tilt the scales on how that may ultimately play itself out. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1642.44s)]
*  With Republicans in control, passage of legislation or some form of it seems likely, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1648.04s)]
*  but a full decoupling from China remains improbable due to the complexities of global supply chains. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1653.56s)]
*  For CMC heads, the Act is already shifting discussions with stakeholders. Even if it doesn't [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1660.12s)]
*  pass, the push for more secure supply chains is prompting companies to diversify with alternatives [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1665.08s)]
*  to Southeast Asia, India, and North America. The Biosecure Act could accelerate this trend by [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1672.76s)]
*  offering incentives to source domestically or from trusted countries. The legislation will likely [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1678.52s)]
*  target critical materials like APIs and essential medical supplies, which is with a phase shift away [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1684.68s)]
*  from China. A complete break, as I said, is unlikely, but companies should prepare by [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1693.4s)]
*  establishing contingency plans and alternative supplier relationships to stay ahead of an [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1698.3600000000001s)]
*  evolving compliance standards. I would also say that I think some of this concern is a little [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1703.56s)]
*  misplaced, going back to what you're saying, we're in a global world. I don't know where the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1710.44s)]
*  concept of doing good for humanity falls into that equation, but the consequences of all these things [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1717.64s)]
*  do shift costs. Again, it's a theme that we're touching on that it certainly doesn't help [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1726.28s)]
*  innovation. Let's put it that way. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1733.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The concept that the Biosecure Act could accelerate something that we've all been, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1735.56s)]
*  as an industry, and virtually every company in the space has been working on since the supply chain [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1746.28s)]
*  issues that we saw during COVID. The idea that the Biosecure Act could accelerate that progress, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1754.44s)]
*  and it would be good progress towards more secure, robust, onshore, near shore supply chains, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1760.36s)]
*  isn't lost on me. That idea is not lost on me. The thing that concerns me, I think, is just how [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1768.6s)]
*  quickly we can get there. Is the infrastructure anywhere near in place to make up that shortfall, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1773.8s)]
*  even if a significant percentage? It's certainly not going to happen carte blanche across the board. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1782.4399999999998s)]
*  I think in terms of whatever timelines are imposed, I'm going to go on a limb here and say [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1788.68s)]
*  that those are going to continue to be moved out. I think there's a lot of jaw boning here, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1795.5600000000002s)]
*  but I think in terms of what you're calling out the practicality of it all, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1802.1200000000001s)]
*  I do think it'll move out. As somebody once told me years ago, if you can't jump over the bar, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1807.0800000000002s)]
*  you lower it. My sense is that that's what's going to ultimately play out in practice. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1814.36s)]
*  Mike H [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1819.9599999999998s)]
*  Nye You mentioned the investment environment. Again, painting with a super broad brush, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1827.82s)]
*  traditionally, historically, I think it's fair to say that Republican administrations [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1829.7199999999998s)]
*  have been associated with more favorable or agreeable conditions for M&A activity and business [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1835.0s)]
*  in general. I guess I haven't studied it too closely specific to pharma and biopharma, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1841.48s)]
*  but what do you see coming next year and beyond with this administration in terms of its [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1851.8s)]
*  receptivity to creating a more favorable M&A environment? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1862.3600000000001s)]
*  Mike H [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1867.4s)]
*  Nye I think what you're touching on is completely accurate. Historically, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1868.68s)]
*  Republican administrations have forced the conditions favorable for M&A activity, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1873.88s)]
*  especially in sectors like healthcare where pro-business policies can reduce regulatory [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1878.44s)]
*  friction. In contrast, current leadership with the FTC under Lena Cahn's oversight has been [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1884.04s)]
*  pushing very aggressively against monopolistic practices and has actually created significant [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1894.76s)]
*  headwinds for M&A and major deals like the Amgen Horizon merger face prolonged scrutiny [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1900.44s)]
*  only to ultimately be approved. But it did put an overhang on M&A and raise the spectrum of what [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1907.8s)]
*  could possibly be approved versus something that might get held up. So I think by no other [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1918.36s)]
*  changes, but by removing Lena Cahn from the FTC, I think you're going to see a more favorable M&A [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1926.4399999999998s)]
*  environment. And I think when you factor that with the historical Republican practices that [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1933.32s)]
*  foster this, I do think that this will be very helpful. Looking ahead, this shift in leadership [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1940.44s)]
*  should signal a return to a more business-friendly approach, which would likely spur M&A, enabling [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1950.28s)]
*  companies to scale, innovate, and remain competitive. A robust M&A market is crucial not only as a [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1955.88s)]
*  capital market catalyst, but also as a fundamental ingredient for healthy, dynamic, bio-farmer [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1962.2s)]
*  markets. While we may see less regulatory intervention, companies should still prepare [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1967.88s)]
*  for targeted antitrust concerns, particularly in healthcare, where large deals may face [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1973.16s)]
*  some scrutiny. But I do think that things will loosen up, and I'm confident that [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1979.24s)]
*  we'll see more activity in that part of the market. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1987.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, that would be welcome. That would be welcome coming out of a lengthy, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1991.16s)]
*  protracted constriction in this space. I want to talk a little bit about the implications of, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=1998.2s)]
*  again, this is broader scale, but the implications of Trump's promised tax cuts. This was a major [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2007.72s)]
*  part of his campaign. In order to cut taxes across the border, to any degree, they're going to need [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2017.0s)]
*  to be cut. The position is they're going to need to create efficiencies and spend less in government. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2028.12s)]
*  In the first term, the first Trump administration, there was an attempt to make one of those cuts, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2035.96s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. That didn't happen. Do you think that the ACA is on the [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2041.96s)]
*  chopping block again, kind of in the context of, like I said, the general desire to create some [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2049.32s)]
*  savings somewhere to enable tax cuts that he's promised? It's a fair question. Certainly, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2058.04s)]
*  Trump has made noise during his first term that that was something that he wanted to [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2067.8s)]
*  reverse. But the ACA has proven rather resilient. The pressure to cut spending on taxes could put [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2073.0s)]
*  it back on the table. From my perspective, I think full appeal remains unlikely, though I think [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2079.88s)]
*  there's a couple of reasons why that's the case. I wouldn't be surprised if it's tweaked a little [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2086.92s)]
*  bit, but I think for the most part, it's had a lot of popularity over time. Provisions like [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2091.88s)]
*  coverage for pre-existing conditions and Medicaid expansion have built strong public support, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2099.7200000000003s)]
*  making a full repeal politically risky, in my opinion. Even with Republican control, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2105.8s)]
*  I think consensus on a complete repeal is tough. But like I said, I do think that there's room for [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2114.36s)]
*  targeted reforms that can be made. Given that Trump likes to redefine everything as his, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2121.96s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised in his Trump-inesque activities that he makes a few tweaks and then [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2132.44s)]
*  calls it Trump-caps. I also think the fiscal restraints, while tax cuts may prompt budget [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2138.84s)]
*  cuts, outright appeal would disrupt coverage for millions of people and we're more likely to see [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2148.44s)]
*  cuts to subsidies, limited Medicaid expansion, or more state control via block grants. In the end, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2153.2400000000002s)]
*  administration may focus on incremental changes that align with conservative priorities, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2160.76s)]
*  promoting private insurance, reducing regulations, and expanding health savings accounts while [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2165.56s)]
*  avoiding the political fallout of removing popular ACA benefits. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2172.2799999999997s)]
*  Scott Cunningham Yeah, yeah. I want to shift gears back to RFK again. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2178.04s)]
*  Long before his nomination, he had indicated that he wanted to play a part in a new Trump [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2186.52s)]
*  administration to work with him to, quote, ban pharmaceutical advertising on television. I don't [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2193.72s)]
*  want to overstate that influence and frankly, I don't see that happening. But I'm curious about [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2201.24s)]
*  your take on whether there's a place for an RFK-esque prevention and health forward approach [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2208.04s)]
*  in pharma's direct to consumer marketing. Is there a place or a world where you can see these two [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2218.2s)]
*  things peacefully coexisting in a constructive way? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2224.2799999999997s)]
*  John Svigel You know, I think it fits the pendulum analogy in terms of calibration. I think RFK [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2227.64s)]
*  Juniors pushed to ban DTC pharmaceutical ads. Marks are shipped in healthcare policy, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2235.56s)]
*  but I don't believe a full ban is likely due to pharma's strong backing and media support. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2241.64s)]
*  What else are we going to watch during the football games? I'm kidding. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2248.68s)]
*  Scott Cunningham I always joke around, I hope my mom doesn't listen to this podcast. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2251.0s)]
*  My mom's like 76 years old. And we have a little inside running joke in our family where [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2256.12s)]
*  if she sees a pharmaceutical ad on television, she's suddenly afflicted by whatever indication [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2264.6s)]
*  that therapeutic is targeting. Like she's just learned about it for the first time on television, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2272.3599999999997s)]
*  and suddenly she has restless leg syndrome. You know? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2277.4s)]
*  John Svigel That's very funny. I have a lot of empathy for that. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2280.3599999999997s)]
*  Actually, in my earlier in my career, I was doing a project that was a hostile investor [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2284.68s)]
*  that was going after a company and the company's product, one of their commercial product was for [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2292.7599999999998s)]
*  restless leg. So I self-diagnosed myself and went on it. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2297.56s)]
*  Scott Cunningham Yeah. So that's what that is. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2302.44s)]
*  John Svigel Yeah. I can see how that people do that. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2306.2s)]
*  You know? I think RFK's focus on prevention could reshape the conversation a little bit. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2310.68s)]
*  The DTC advertising, while effective at raising awareness, including your mother, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2321.0s)]
*  is often criticized for promoting costly drugs and influencing patient demand outside of clinical [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2325.8s)]
*  guidelines. RFK's prevention agenda and his focus on reducing chronic diseases through lifestyle [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2331.96s)]
*  changes, screenings, and community initiatives could complement farmers' efforts. It's really [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2339.08s)]
*  consistent with patient engagement, as we've talked about and much has been said. Diabetes is [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2344.84s)]
*  the greatest, in my opinion, is the poster child for patient engagement. If you just manage [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2350.92s)]
*  your lifestyle, you'd reduce a lot of the risks, simply put. I think there's a possible compromise, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2356.2s)]
*  ultimately, to your question. Instead of a ban, I would expect potentially tighter [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2364.12s)]
*  regulations on DTC ads, ensuring a balanced view of the benefits and the risks, and more public [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2368.36s)]
*  health campaigns integrating prevention with farmers' message. I think that would also help [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2376.28s)]
*  farmers' bad boy image as well, if you're actually showing care for outcomes and prevention, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2382.76s)]
*  as opposed to just being perceived as that dead drug pusher on the playground. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2391.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, RFK's got this reputation. He set it in stone, I think, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2397.0s)]
*  when he was running in the primaries. He was out there on the campaign trail, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2405.0800000000004s)]
*  doing push-ups and posing shirtless, the picture of fitness. I haven't read anything about this, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2411.1600000000003s)]
*  but I wonder what his take on GLP-1s is, where he stands on that. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2417.1600000000003s)]
*  No, that would be interesting. I don't recall him taking that particular issue on. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2423.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2431.64s)]
*  I do think his leadership offers a chance to bridge the gap between farmers' commercial goals [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2431.8799999999997s)]
*  and broader public health priorities, creating opportunities for coexistence. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2438.04s)]
*  At least I'm trying to see a balance. I saw something recently where the FDA commissioner [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2443.3199999999997s)]
*  was talking about how he thought the FDA was working at a very high level, and he was very [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2450.36s)]
*  concerned at the pending changes. There's obviously different perspectives here. I've often [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2455.8s)]
*  quipped that there's always three sides to everything, at least three sides to everything. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2464.76s)]
*  I think taking a fresh look at how we do business and how we conduct things through the lens of [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2469.88s)]
*  broader public health priorities is a healthy exercise. I'm not sure if people are embracing [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2477.4s)]
*  the messenger, but I think certainly what the concept has merit. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2482.6000000000004s)]
*  All right. Well, in the time we have left here, Alan, I'll let you get on with your day, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2491.8s)]
*  but I'm curious generally, and I've appreciated your tempered and balanced perspectives on these [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2494.84s)]
*  questions. We need some more temper and balance, I think, in these conversations, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2502.36s)]
*  and I appreciate that. Looking ahead, the election directly behind us, these nominations coming [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2509.2400000000002s)]
*  furiously, I'm sure by the time this episode drops, we'll have more news that we could have discussed [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2519.56s)]
*  on this episode. But given where you stand right now and what you're seeing playing out, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2525.7200000000003s)]
*  are you bullish? Are you bearish? Are you neutral? Are you cautious? Let me take your temperature [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2531.8s)]
*  on how you're feeling about the next four years. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2540.92s)]
*  Okay. I don't know how I feel about tomorrow, but I'll go for the next four years. I would [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2545.8s)]
*  say I'm optimistic about the next four years for life sciences, driven by innovation and the [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2554.84s)]
*  industry's proven resilience. The outlook is strong with a foundation built on scientific [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2560.92s)]
*  breakthroughs and growing market opportunities. Key drivers of optimism for me are the scientific [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2566.76s)]
*  advancements, targeted therapies, emerging modalities, or revolutionizing disease treatment, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2573.0s)]
*  or renew hopes for previously untreatable conditions. I think the economic conditions, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2579.4s)]
*  the backdrop, is certainly better, is trending in a much better direction with interest rates [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2584.92s)]
*  starting to drop. The economic backdrop is becoming more favorable and encouraging investment in the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2590.6800000000003s)]
*  sector. As chronic diseases rise and global population ages demand for innovative solutions [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2596.44s)]
*  for cardio metabolic health and rare diseases and oncology continue to expand. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2605.88s)]
*  The industry is very resilient and adaptable. Life sciences have consistently navigated regulatory [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2612.28s)]
*  shifts and challenges ensuring ongoing progress and innovation. The life science industry remains [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2618.76s)]
*  very well positioned to making a lasting impact on public health and shape the future of medicine. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2624.52s)]
*  When I think about it, when you think about money spent on foreign aid, defense, relative to [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2630.6800000000003s)]
*  what's spent in drug development and pharma, our industry makes a much greater impact on humanity [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2638.92s)]
*  than any of those other endeavors. Why we're always the host a child is probably making of our own. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2647.48s)]
*  But when you take a step back, there's a lot to be proud of what we've done and continue to do. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2657.7999999999997s)]
*  I think that instills the optimism for the future. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2664.2s)]
*  Yeah, very good. Well, like I said, the tempered and thoughtful discussion is appreciated, Alan. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2667.3199999999997s)]
*  It's always a pleasure. You know what I'm looking forward to? As I sit here right now, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2676.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm looking forward to a couple of months from now having a drink with you at JP Morgan. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2680.44s)]
*  I'm looking forward to seeing you. I'm sure I'll talk to you again before then, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2684.6s)]
*  but I am looking forward to hanging out with you in San Francisco, which, by the way, I'll be on [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2688.04s)]
*  site. This is for our listeners benefit. I'll be on site at JPM. I think I'll be recording pretty [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2693.08s)]
*  much all day in person episodes on the 14th and all day on the 15th. So, hey, if you've got any [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2697.96s)]
*  great biotech execs, founders that are going to be at JPM and want to be on the business of biotech, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2705.32s)]
*  it's a fine time to get in touch with me right now to get on the schedule because it fills up [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2711.0s)]
*  quickly. But in between all that recording, Alan, we're going to make some time to hang out like [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2716.7599999999998s)]
*  we do. No, that sounds awesome. I look forward to hanging out with you, JP Morgan. I look forward to [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2722.12s)]
*  talking between now and then. And I would also, I think, just add one more thing as we wrap up. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2728.68s)]
*  I wanted to put some perspective on the US healthcare system and give it some context [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2735.4s)]
*  because we talked about pharma and its impact. But I think it's worth noting that we spend over [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2742.2s)]
*  $4 trillion annually, more than any country. Yet with a younger population, our life expectancy [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2748.52s)]
*  still lags behind many Western nations. We actually pay more for less, believe it or not. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2755.7999999999997s)]
*  This stark disconnect reveals the deep inefficiencies in the system, especially [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2762.52s)]
*  when we consider that only 10% of healthcare spending goes to pharmaceuticals. I think people [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2767.1600000000003s)]
*  are focusing on the wrong target. Here's the real issue. While everyone is talking about drug prices, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2772.36s)]
*  they make up just a small fraction of total spending. It's like the tail wagging the dog. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2779.4s)]
*  The real boogeyman driving up costs without improving outcomes lies elsewhere in the system. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2784.92s)]
*  We need to focus on those broader structural problems. Reform isn't easy. Our healthcare [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2790.2000000000003s)]
*  system is fragmented with stakeholders siloed and often working in their own interests, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2796.04s)]
*  not the patients. Imagine if ATM transactions took days because of misplaced records, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2800.76s)]
*  or if car manufacturers didn't monitor product quality. Extreme. These may be extreme examples, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2807.32s)]
*  but it highlights the systemic lack of accountability in healthcare. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2813.72s)]
*  But here's the opportunity. This dysfunction represents a chance to rethink how care is [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2818.52s)]
*  delivered. The key shift will be moving from volume to value, what I call risk sharing, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2824.4399999999996s)]
*  where stakeholders share responsibility for patient outcomes. It's a tough shift, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2830.7599999999998s)]
*  but necessary for real change. As Wayne Gretzky famously said, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2834.8399999999997s)]
*  I skate to where the puck is going, not where it's been. The system will inevitably change. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2840.2799999999997s)]
*  And while it won't be easy, the potential to transform healthcare is enormous. If we get it [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2845.56s)]
*  right, the next few years could bring radical change to both healthcare and the life sciences [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2850.6s)]
*  industry. Yeah. Hence the bullish optimistic perspective. And I couldn't agree more. I mean, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2854.6s)]
*  those are some great analogies, by the way, like great context around ATMs and the automobile [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2863.72s)]
*  industry. That's fantastic. And it is mind boggling at times just how rife with inefficiency [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2869.96s)]
*  the most important of those industries is. It is. And we get so much caught in the here and [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2878.44s)]
*  the now that we sometimes lose track of this. And it goes back to what I said earlier, because [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2885.64s)]
*  we did it yesterday, or did it last year. And I think when you're spending $4 trillion on [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2890.76s)]
*  healthcare, there's an opportunity to be more efficient with the way we do it. And particularly, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2897.48s)]
*  the bottom line is we're not living longer. We're not getting a return on that money. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2903.4s)]
*  People should be less defensive and more open-minded would be my perspective. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2910.76s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's a lot of money at stake and therefore it really does fall into the category [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2914.76s)]
*  much easier said than done. Yeah. Well, on that note, and bringing the conversation full circle, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2919.8799999999997s)]
*  we got started early this morning. I cut into your workout time. So go contribute to your [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2925.3999999999996s)]
*  longevity, finish that workout, Alan. And as always, I appreciate you coming on the show [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpXHy1RMzPE&t=2930.52s)]
