# Manufacturing Partnership With Life Biosciences Jerry McLaughlin and Forge Biologics' John Maslowski
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE)
*  LifeBioSciences CEO Jerry McLaughlin joined us last fall for episode 166 of The Business [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=0.0s)]
*  of Biotech, an episode that did a pretty good job of digging into the dynamics of age-related [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=11.36s)]
*  disease in that entire space. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  What we didn't do on that episode was dig into the business mechanics of life's outsourced [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=19.56s)]
*  manufacturing relationship. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=25.44s)]
*  The company's lead candidate is a partial epigenetic reprogramming therapy that it's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=27.8s)]
*  prepping for 2025 IND and optic neuropathies. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=32.52s)]
*  And it's pretty complex work, as is often the case with ATMP development. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  Not just any CDMO will do. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=42.36s)]
*  That is, if any CDMO will do. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=44.44s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  This is The Business of Biotech. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  And on this episode, Jerry is back and he brought a friend to help give us a look under [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  the hood of LifeBioSciences' relationship with its outsourced manufacturing partner. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=55.56s)]
*  That friend is the recently anointed president, anointed or appointed president and CEO of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=61.84s)]
*  Forge Biologics, John Maslowski. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=68.16s)]
*  Forge is a CDMO that got into the cell and gene therapy outsourcing game early and has [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  grown quickly as that space has blossomed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=76.62s)]
*  And John, who likely needs no introduction to folks in the CGT sector, has served the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=79.44s)]
*  C-suite there since 2021, but just took the captain's chair in October of this year. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=85.24s)]
*  He's on the board at Arm and LifeScience Cares and his biochops span companies big and small, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=91.78s)]
*  including Wythe, Merck, Teva, Fibrocell, Castle Creek and more. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  Jerry, welcome back and John, welcome to the show. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=103.12s)]
*  Thank you very much, Matt. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=107.9s)]
*  I'm happy to be here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=109.06s)]
*  Yeah, Matt. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=110.06s)]
*  Thanks for having me back too. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=111.06s)]
*  It's great to see you, dad. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=112.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to see you too. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=113.06s)]
*  I'm thrilled to have you guys on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=114.62s)]
*  And I want to start with Jerry. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=116.34s)]
*  Before we get into the dynamics of the relationship between Forge and life, I want to start with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=118.72s)]
*  Jerry, because like I said, you were on most recently just about a year ago, a little over [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=123.54s)]
*  a year ago. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=126.86000000000001s)]
*  And I love having repeat guests. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=127.86000000000001s)]
*  Oftentimes the span is considerably more than a year. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=131.86s)]
*  So by the time I catch up with someone who's been on the show before, there's two or three [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=134.9s)]
*  years worth of progress to talk about. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=138.78s)]
*  In this case, it's been just about a year. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=142.06s)]
*  But I thought maybe you could give us a little update perhaps on what's happening at life [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=143.86s)]
*  since, I think it was October of last year and what's kind of exciting you about the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=148.86s)]
*  progress going on there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=154.86s)]
*  Yeah, Matt, happy to do it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=156.38s)]
*  Believe it or not, in a year's time, we've had a lot of progress and a lot of exciting [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=158.26s)]
*  things. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=161.86s)]
*  And as you mentioned in your opening, we are on the precipice of entering the clinic, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=162.86s)]
*  Entering an IND, it's here now, it's nearly upon us in mid 2025. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=168.14s)]
*  And we expect to be the first in the partial epigenetic reprogramming space to enter the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  clinic. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=177.5s)]
*  And as you mentioned for two optic neuropathies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  And so what we've been doing since we last talked, I think when we last talked, we had [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=181.42s)]
*  initial data from a non-human primate study in a nion model, which nions basically stroke [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  in the back of the eye where you have damage to the retinal ganglion cells. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  And that was fantastic data that really elevated us out of the mouse world, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=193.38s)]
*  A lot of great data in mice, but making that transition to an eye structure that reflects [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=197.66s)]
*  that of the human and being able to get across an interlimiting membrane and demonstrate [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=202.46s)]
*  expression of our therapy, which we call ER 100, but we're delivering three transcription [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=206.22s)]
*  factors, OSK. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=211.58s)]
*  And so that was fantastic. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=214.02s)]
*  But in the year's time since then, we've really made good progress, which we'll hear about [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=216.02s)]
*  today in manufacturing, as well as we've replicated the non-human primate study, which we're building [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=219.78s)]
*  this company on rigor in science. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=226.3s)]
*  And we thought it was a great step forward to move out of the mouse models into non-human [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  primates, but then to replicate the data and show further expansion and support of restoration [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  of visual function and preservation of retinal ganglion cells was really compelling. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=238.5s)]
*  And we think it really puts us in a confident position going forward to IND. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=244.58s)]
*  Where we are right now is we're right in the middle of IND enabling package, and things [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=249.86s)]
*  are going well there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=255.22s)]
*  But on top of that, it's been a big year from an organization standpoint. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=256.22s)]
*  And I think it's important to mention, you keep your head down, you do good work, and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=260.5s)]
*  you hope maybe someday you'll get recognized. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=266.98s)]
*  And this was our year. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=269.94s)]
*  I think we're starting to, folks are starting to take notice. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=270.94s)]
*  In March, we were recognized as one of the 12 hottest biotechs in the Boston area. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=274.5s)]
*  And just to give you an idea, there's over a thousand biotechs in the greater Boston [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=280.74s)]
*  area. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=284.22s)]
*  So it was a pretty good recognition. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=285.22s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, it'd be quite a different story if you were one of the hottest [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=286.22s)]
*  12 biotechs in Omaha. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  But that's a big deal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, in Omaha, yeah, sure. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  And then we earned a great place to work certification for 2024 and 2025. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=294.18s)]
*  And what you have here, it's really the most definitive recognition as an employer of choice. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=301.18s)]
*  And each year you have over 10,000 companies from 60 plus countries applying, only about [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=305.22s)]
*  1 to 2% qualify. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=309.70000000000005s)]
*  And it's a really good certification. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=312.1s)]
*  A lot of employees, prospective employees look for that certification as a company that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=313.42s)]
*  would be high on their list. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=318.18s)]
*  And then most recently in October, we were one of six companies including the Bostino [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=319.42s)]
*  Fire Award winners. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=324.74s)]
*  And this award recognizes companies in the Boston area, not only for innovation in science, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=328.02000000000004s)]
*  but also how we support the local community in the innovation ecosystem. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=333.56s)]
*  So that's just as important to us with how we serve our community. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  So that's been a big year for us as an organization. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=340.3s)]
*  And we're proud of the employees we have here, our life family. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=342.42s)]
*  We're small now, but we will look to grow into the future. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=346.14000000000004s)]
*  And then most recently, we presented some additional data from our non-human primate [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=349.70000000000005s)]
*  study, our second study. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=355.38000000000005s)]
*  And it expanded upon the data from previous, but also reinforced in this replication of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=356.86s)]
*  the data. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=362.38000000000005s)]
*  And it was presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology, which is the largest eye [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=363.85999999999996s)]
*  physician group in the world and the largest meeting in the world. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  And in the post-mortem of the meeting, Ophthalmology Times put out a top 10 takeaways. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=376.61999999999995s)]
*  And our program, Partial Epigenetic Reprogram, and ER 100 specifically, was listed as the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=382.38s)]
*  number two takeaway from this year's meeting. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=388.02s)]
*  Really innovative. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=391.38s)]
*  And we're looking, particularly in glaucoma, looking beyond IOP lowering and looking at [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=392.38s)]
*  therapeutics that have the potential to reverse disease and restore retinal ganglion cells. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  Because we know that even when you lower IOP effectively, glaucoma, the disease itself [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=403.14s)]
*  continues to move forward. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=408.62s)]
*  So big year for us and a bigger year to come in 2025. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=410.5s)]
*  Yeah, sounds like some great momentum heading into IND and the clinic. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=415.06s)]
*  Like I said, I've had conversations, you know, three years spread with CEOs who had less [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=419.66s)]
*  to report than you just did. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=423.98s)]
*  So congratulations. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  Take a break. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=427.1s)]
*  Take a rest. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=428.1s)]
*  You know, the holidays are coming. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=429.1s)]
*  Take some time off if you need to. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=430.1s)]
*  John, I want to turn to you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=432.22s)]
*  And I think I know the most exciting thing going on in your life right now. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=435.74s)]
*  You're a couple months into the CEO's chair at Forge. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=439.46s)]
*  I mean, if there's more exciting stuff going on, certainly share that with us. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=446.02s)]
*  But I thought that that'd be a nice segue into sort of how that transition unfolded. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=449.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=454.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, very excited and honored to be taking over this wonderful team at Forge. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=456.38s)]
*  We've had this great partnership now for nearly a year with Ajinomoto after our acquisition. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=462.18s)]
*  And you know, Tim Miller was our leader through the acquisition, through the birth and growth [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=467.26s)]
*  of Forge, you know, decided for his career to go on and do new things. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=472.96s)]
*  And we thank him for all of his entrepreneurship and leadership through the transition. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=478.56s)]
*  But you know, very lucky for me and as I mentioned, honored to be asked by Ajinomoto to take over [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  the helm and see this transition as we're now really positioning Forge going into more [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  later stage production, more commercial minded discussions with some of our clients and working [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  with really great new technologies like Jerry and Sharon and Michelle and his team's, you [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=503.23999999999995s)]
*  know, CMC needs on their program that you just discussed. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=509.23999999999995s)]
*  So you know, great transition for me, really set up well with the team here. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=512.56s)]
*  What I've noticed though, maybe to give a quick update on Forge is just seeing tremendous [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=518.52s)]
*  growth in the organization. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=522.24s)]
*  And I think in areas where you want your CDMOs to grow, right? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=524.28s)]
*  We're seeing expansions in our, you know, in all of our technical operations groups, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=527.64s)]
*  MS&T, our quality units are pacing properly with those. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=533.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're still growing our systems as we are graduating now into more of a commercially [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  minded support system. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  So a lot of that growth over the last year or so with Forge and looking forward now, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=544.0s)]
*  it's interesting, you know, we talk in biotech about I have cash for a year or I got a year [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  to couple years of runway. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=553.6s)]
*  Here's my plan. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=554.8s)]
*  Now working under the umbrella of a much larger organization under Japan, we talk about the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=556.04s)]
*  2030 plan now and beyond. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=561.0799999999999s)]
*  So it's for us, it gives us an opportunity to focus less on, you know, some of the funding [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=563.16s)]
*  and sort of banking side of business and really concentrate on what's really our master [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=568.6s)]
*  site plan? What's our execution plan over the course of the next nearly a decade of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=573.12s)]
*  gene therapy growth as we all foresee the future really blossoming into more commercial [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  products and really how do we not only treat rare diseases, but broader rare diseases and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=582.36s)]
*  now thinking about supplying non rare diseases. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=587.36s)]
*  So it's a really great thought process we have here at Forge and now with the ability to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=589.7600000000001s)]
*  see down the road a bit and think about things like capex investments in real ways. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  It's really a wonderful time for us to be thinking about growth and seeing very good [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=599.32s)]
*  traction through companies now funded and bringing really, really interesting technologies. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=604.32s)]
*  We're very lucky as we have the chance to work with them and really help them, you know, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=610.4s)]
*  move their development along. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=613.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, the last time I talked with the CEO of Forge Biologics, it was Tim Miller. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=616.88s)]
*  And I remember a good portion of our conversation, we kind of hovered on the development and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=622.04s)]
*  growth happening in Columbus. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=627.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm kind of playing off Jerry's recognition, you know, of Life Biosciences is a hot company [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=629.16s)]
*  in Boston. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  Not to discredit Columbus, not quite the biotech hub that Boston is. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=635.44s)]
*  But at the time, you know, Jerry and I talked about Columbus is just a few hours away for [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=640.32s)]
*  me. I see the city growing incredibly. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  Give us an update on the Columbus kind of atmosphere and how that's advantageous to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=648.24s)]
*  does it remain advantageous to Forge being in the Columbus area? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=654.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, it's a great question. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=657.72s)]
*  When I asked when I first joined Forge coming from Philadelphia, you know, you know, sort [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=658.96s)]
*  of advanced therapy, hotbed along with the West Coast and Boston and, you know, the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=663.76s)]
*  question of talent and growth and everything in the area. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=669.04s)]
*  Well, nationwide hospital is a birthplace. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=671.64s)]
*  A lot of the original gene therapies that are now commercial, including, you know, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=674.08s)]
*  Invexus and Sareptis products. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=679.56s)]
*  And, you know, luckily, I have a lot of team members here who come from those backgrounds [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  and organizations. You know, not only is the city one of the fastest growing in the US, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=685.28s)]
*  the life science, I'm very impressed with the life science presence here. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=689.68s)]
*  More companies emerging, technologies, universities, you know, quite frankly, putting out [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=693.08s)]
*  a lot of scientific majors that we've been very lucky to bring in seed RGMP and a lot of [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=698.44s)]
*  our process analytical development groups. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=703.32s)]
*  So, you know, as as it's a newer developing area, we do see technical talent. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=705.88s)]
*  We see really wonderful growth. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=712.24s)]
*  Reasonable costs for building is really important part to to remember. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=714.2s)]
*  And a hub here that we can ship to, you know, most we do international shipments and US [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  shipments within a lot of very reasonable time frame. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=724.6s)]
*  So for us, it's really became a very advantageous central area for us to concentrate our [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=727.16s)]
*  organization on, even though we have a global presence with our commercial sales force and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=732.52s)]
*  other parts of our business. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=737.96s)]
*  But, you know, really excited to see how the next, you know, the next year is really grow the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=739.4s)]
*  talent pool in the area in a way that, you know, groups like Bio Ohio are all contributing to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=744.72s)]
*  that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=748.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, very cool. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=749.32s)]
*  Good deal. Jerry, I want to turn back to you and we'll start talking about the I guess the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=750.96s)]
*  origins of the relationship between life biosciences and and Forge. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=755.0400000000001s)]
*  But before there was even Forge necessarily on your radar, Jerry, you know, you talk about [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=759.2s)]
*  the momentum going on at life biosciences. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=764.4s)]
*  At what point in that momentum? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=767.84s)]
*  I think my notes say the partnership with Forge came together, what, last spring. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=770.96s)]
*  So prior to last spring, as you were contemplating the outsourced manufacturing space and your next [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=777.12s)]
*  move there, what was the, I guess, catalyst for that? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=785.28s)]
*  Yeah, so it was when we moved from the mouse models into the non-humor primate data and when [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=789.52s)]
*  we were able to demonstrate expression in the retinal ganglion cells and restoration of visual [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=795.6s)]
*  function in the non-humor primate model where we were able to deliver our therapeutic across the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=800.16s)]
*  interlimiting membrane, introvertially and then crossing through the interlimiting membrane. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  With that positive results, we had prepped, we went to the board and we made that decision. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=809.04s)]
*  And it's not something we, as a small company, particularly in gene therapy, it is the most [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=814.88s)]
*  significant spend to date in the history of the company and a major, major use of our remaining [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=820.24s)]
*  resources. So we needed confidence and we staged that as a key milestone and a trigger [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=827.2s)]
*  to set up the agreement, ultimately it was with Forge, but we had started the process well over a [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=832.88s)]
*  year prior. Well over a year prior. Yeah. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=838.64s)]
*  And what did that process look like? I don't expect you to go through it line by line, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=841.44s)]
*  but what were the criteria that you were looking for in the meeting? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=847.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's criteria and then process. I think process is really important [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=849.84s)]
*  and it's something I think as a small company, particularly when we're short staffed, we own [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=854.24s)]
*  a company of 12 people. Sometimes the oversight on this process, but it's so important for the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=858.32s)]
*  company. We don't pick the right partner, we're in trouble. So really we look at team and by team, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=864.24s)]
*  we mean the technical expertise and the history of those involved, knowing who will be involved, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=870.48s)]
*  knowing their commitment to our program. And that's sort of a sense you have to get [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=876.16s)]
*  through repeated interactions and doing site visits and having meetings and having calls [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=881.92s)]
*  and reviewing. And ultimately it's sort of an informed gut feel at the end. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=887.52s)]
*  And then are they eager to succeed? Are you just another customer, a number, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=893.04s)]
*  or are you critically important to their business? And as a small company, our ER100, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=898.56s)]
*  our lead program is critical to our life as a company. And is it going to be as important [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=905.28s)]
*  to your partner? And a lot of folks can talk about that, but do they deliver in the end? And [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=911.28s)]
*  that's critically important. One, and two, can they meet timelines? We look at history of the [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=916.0s)]
*  company. And so in the case of Forge, we had to do a proxy for that. It's a history and the proven [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  capabilities of the leadership team there. And we did our diligence on everyone there. And what we [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=925.92s)]
*  liked in this case, just to cut to the chase on Forge was we liked the fact that a guy like John [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=931.04s)]
*  not only had manufacturing expertise, but was an operator. And several others in their leadership [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=938.48s)]
*  team, whether it was from a regulatory standpoint or building out the facility, they had a long [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=943.9200000000001s)]
*  history of building and working in facilities. And so that gave us a lot of confidence and they [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=948.96s)]
*  had a vision. These were folks just like us, most of our management team, we've worked for 20 or 25 [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=954.24s)]
*  years in the industry, but we came to Life Biosciences because we had a shared vision of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  how we can change the world through healthspan, right? And so we saw the similar thing at [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=963.04s)]
*  Forge. So there's that connection as well, a shared vision, a shared mission. The process of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=968.32s)]
*  what we did, we started out with 10 or 12. Our senior vice president of CMC, which John had [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=972.5600000000001s)]
*  mentioned, Michel Wattje, he put a ton of work over months interrogating, assessing technical [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=978.24s)]
*  expertise of 10 or 12 potential CROs. We actually had informal bids sent in from those and work [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=986.0s)]
*  plans. We then threw an arduous process, including bringing in, which I applaud for him, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=993.84s)]
*  he brought in an outside consultant who worked in the gene therapy space for a long, long time to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=998.4s)]
*  help evaluate each of these and identify where we may be missing things, right? They have a good [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1004.32s)]
*  understanding of the CROs, all their strengths and weaknesses. And so that helped to streamline and [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1009.36s)]
*  put the process on a level playing field. Over time, we took that down to six and then we took [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1015.36s)]
*  it down to three for the more formal assessment, which involves site visits, not only by our CMC [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1020.32s)]
*  team, but I went on those site visits as well. And we had a chance to further evaluate the teams [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1026.8s)]
*  and then getting final bids. Over time, those bids get more granular and more specific. You [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1032.3200000000002s)]
*  learn a lot in those interactions. And ultimately we made the decision that Forge was the most [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1039.68s)]
*  optimal partner for us from their focus, their vision, their capabilities, our needs, and what [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1047.6s)]
*  they could provide. Yeah. On the capabilities note, I'm just curious for some perspective on this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  It occurs to me that if you're the CEO of a company that's looking to take an antibody to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1060.7199999999998s)]
*  IND and into the clinic and you need an outsourcing partner and you start with a list, you start with [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1066.7199999999998s)]
*  a list of 12 antibodies, ADCs, vaccines, you're probably going to start with a much bigger list [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1072.88s)]
*  because there are far more outsourced manufacturers out there working on those traditional biologics. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1078.24s)]
*  And perhaps your winnowing down of that list is going to be a long and arduous process because [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1086.5600000000002s)]
*  you're looking for nuance. Like everybody can manufacture an antibody. In the gene therapy space, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1092.48s)]
*  you know, the requirements are far more unique and selective and complex. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1098.16s)]
*  How did that impact that winnowing down process for you? Did you quickly go from 12 to 6 because [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1106.0s)]
*  you just realized like, hey, these first six we looked at or these six that we looked at [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1113.2s)]
*  simply don't have the technical capability to do what we do? That's right. That was the easy part, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1117.68s)]
*  right? But I think it's good to start broad. You learn a lot about what offerings there are [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1122.4s)]
*  and whether there may be gaps in your thinking along the way and you ask better questions of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1128.96s)]
*  the other CROs. So we quickly were able to bring it down from 12 to 6. Plus there's not a time to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1134.16s)]
*  have a fulsome process and it's not also, it's not fair to the CRO. So we quickly were able to narrow [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1139.3600000000001s)]
*  down to 6 largely based on technical expertise and just a feel of fit. You'd be amazed how sometimes [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1144.96s)]
*  you're just not a priority on someone's list and that gives you a pretty big answer. And then from [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1151.28s)]
*  there, we got a little more serious spending a lot more time starting to involve others in the group, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1157.12s)]
*  expanding just beyond the SVP of CMC, but also our CSO and then bringing even in the executive team [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1162.8799999999999s)]
*  to pressure test the capabilities just from a generalist perspective as well [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1169.04s)]
*  and a business relationship. And that took us down to 3 and then ultimately we were able to make the [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1173.04s)]
*  decision. So that happened over that process was well over a year. Yeah. I want to ask you one more [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1178.96s)]
*  question on that process. I promise I'll get to you, John. We'll get back to you. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1186.4s)]
*  Let Jerry tell the story. Yeah. And this one, it's a little bit more esoteric, right? You talked about [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1192.24s)]
*  determining that there was a fit that could see things through, right? That was going to give you [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1202.4s)]
*  the time, the attention, going to treat you like you're the most important molecule in their four [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1207.52s)]
*  walls. To your point, I mean, it's easy to deliver lip service on that kind of thing. How do you vet [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1212.4s)]
*  that and sort of quantify it, not just qualify it like, yeah, I really like those guys. They're [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1220.0s)]
*  making a lot of promises that sound good to me. Matt, I've been doing this for 35 years. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1226.0s)]
*  So John and I didn't know each other per se. Maybe we had met once or twice, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1232.16s)]
*  but we have a lot of close friends in common. And also one of our scientists worked with one [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1237.04s)]
*  of their senior executives at a gene therapy company. We vet, when we got down to the small list, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1243.92s)]
*  we vet the management team too, particularly in the case of Forge. They were a new entity. They [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1250.24s)]
*  were a little bit of an unknown. We vetted the individuals separately from our interactions. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1253.52s)]
*  Just to be honest, that's what we do. No, that's exactly what I was looking for. I mean, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1259.04s)]
*  that's the valuable insight I'm looking for, right? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1262.88s)]
*  I mean, I just can't operate otherwise. I think that's incumbent upon us. Particularly, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1264.88s)]
*  you have a choice there. Do you go with Trident True or do you go with IBM or do you go with Apple? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1270.88s)]
*  And for us, Apple was the future. And we were able to get very comfortable with their integrity, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1275.44s)]
*  their track record of success. And I think their ability, because several of them, including John, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1281.8400000000001s)]
*  had worked in nascent biotechs where we have to be flexible. We need great support. We don't have [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1287.28s)]
*  armies of people. And so we're going to rely on them as a, and everyone says partner, but it's a [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1293.92s)]
*  partner in the foxhole because this is complicated stuff here, gene therapy. We're getting better at [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1299.2s)]
*  it and more predictable and higher confidence and we'll get there. But you run into problems along [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1305.76s)]
*  the way, always. There's always challenges along the way. And we needed to know that the team on [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1311.84s)]
*  the other side was going to be there for us. And that's not only their background and where they [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1315.76s)]
*  come from, so they understand, but then building personal relationships. And there are simple things [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1319.84s)]
*  that you would be surprised. The business development team in Forge was just responsive [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1325.52s)]
*  to every question, every need in a timely fashion. That makes a difference for a small company [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1331.28s)]
*  because it's a window into the soul of the company. Before you're working, you're working primarily [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1336.56s)]
*  with BD. And then I'll tell you, when I went on a site visit, you're not only meeting with the team [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1341.6s)]
*  in the room, but I like to go into John Pryor's notes, but I kind of moseyed over to the break room, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1348.0s)]
*  get a cup of coffee and just see the interactions among folks over luncheon in the break room, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1351.84s)]
*  right? What their attitude is and how they're operating. And I got to tell you, it's a high, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1356.7199999999998s)]
*  and we did our research on Columbus as well because we had the same question, what's Columbus? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1362.9599999999998s)]
*  Columbus was known for financial services and insurance, right? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1367.84s)]
*  In my household, it's known as a place my wife likes to go to shop. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1371.52s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, shopping. But it's amazing with Ohio State, Case Western, other universities, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1374.32s)]
*  Cincinnati, with Cincinnati Children's, the sourcing for technical and STEM is amazing. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1380.96s)]
*  John probably could give us statistics of how many people they have applied for their internships [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1390.72s)]
*  and for their jobs. It's unbelievable. And it's a great place to live, right? So we got very [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1394.24s)]
*  comfortable with it that they had the technical expertise and the right mindset and right attitude. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1399.36s)]
*  So it was a really nice fit for us in the end. Yeah, are you going to take a little bit of a [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1406.16s)]
*  chance going with the new kid on the block? But they're no longer that now. I think we picked [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1410.08s)]
*  right in terms of their success and their growth. Yeah, very good. John, I'm going to give you, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1414.72s)]
*  I want to ask you a question, but I want you to guard yourself from becoming a chief commercial [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1420.48s)]
*  officer at Ford's Biologics in your response. I'll do my best. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1426.32s)]
*  Yeah. So Jerry referenced BD sort of being the tip of the spear, the initial interface with a [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1430.6399999999999s)]
*  sponsor company. I've worked, I've never worked for an outsourced biopharmaceutical manufacturer, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1437.84s)]
*  but I've worked in plenty of environments with BD teams who over-promised on capabilities and then [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1444.56s)]
*  left ops holding the bag, so to speak. And I've covered this space, I haven't covered it for a [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1452.6399999999999s)]
*  long, long time, but I've covered it long enough to see that happen in the outsourced manufacturing [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1459.44s)]
*  community. So the question I want to ask you is how, and I mean, I'd like you to answer this as [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  objectively as possible. How do you guard against that in your role, your management team? How do [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1470.48s)]
*  you guard against, because a lot of the stuff we're seeing for the first time, folks, and it's easy [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1478.4s)]
*  to say, yeah, we'll take that challenge and then turn around and go, wow, we signed up for something [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1482.8s)]
*  we can't deliver on. So how do you guard against that? Well, it's a great question. And Matt, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1486.88s)]
*  Jerry said this very well on the other side. Ford's management team has been on the other [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1493.6s)]
*  side of this. We all were drug developers coming into this role. And I think one thing that attracted [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1498.72s)]
*  me to Forge coming from developing cell therapies for rare skin diseases really was, can we build a [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1504.0s)]
*  CDMO that avoids the things we didn't like about working with CDMOs? One of which is exactly what [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1509.76s)]
*  you're talking about is transparency. And I think it's very easy when you have a dedicated BD team [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  that's really pushing hard. And I think they do it from a right part of their heart to go out and [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1522.4s)]
*  really try to sell the wares of the organization. But I think we tried to set it up and also being [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1528.0s)]
*  in the role of chief commercial officer previously in a little bit of a different way. And it really [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1533.6s)]
*  is to make sure that we're very tightly connected to the technical side of our organization. What [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1538.32s)]
*  are our true capabilities at this point in time? And what do we honestly think we could be doing? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1542.64s)]
*  Sometimes these programs can be a year plus long as you're moving through development. Where will [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1547.6s)]
*  it be then? And making sure we're very clearly communicating that with the client. So over [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1552.0s)]
*  promising never buys you anything. And I've heard it plenty of times on the other side of the bench. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1557.04s)]
*  And I think clients appreciate when you can be like, Forge is actually not prepared to do these [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1563.6s)]
*  particular things. Here's our plans to get there. Does that fit your needs? Now here's an actual [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1568.08s)]
*  tangible thing we've done that try to manage this. So we've taken a little bit of a different [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1573.2s)]
*  approach when it comes to our sales force. So we do have what we call client development, which is, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1577.36s)]
*  I think, more along the lines of the BD rep. But they're paired almost like in drug [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1582.24s)]
*  sales with a technical sales advisor. So really what this is, is now a technical sales expert, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1587.28s)]
*  which is usually a team of AV scientists. We have PhDs. It almost reminds me of a sales [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1593.28s)]
*  medical liaison. Where they are paired with the sales rep to give the technical [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1602.96s)]
*  sort of readout collection of information, collect the needs of the client. So we can [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1609.68s)]
*  marry the sales and commercial side rep business a lot better with the technical side. Now, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1615.76s)]
*  I don't want every scientist in the lab on every sales call. They need to be doing work [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1622.0s)]
*  in developing programs and PD and AD work. So we actually have a dedicated team who does that to [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1626.0s)]
*  connect what we're capable of now to where we are in the future. And they can speak the language [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1631.2s)]
*  of the client just as well. It's really have that technical capability, translate that right up the [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1637.04s)]
*  sales and the proposals so they're clear of where we are now and what we can do. And then when we [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1643.36s)]
*  run through the relationship, once we're now a partner and we have them a client relations rep, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1648.56s)]
*  they continue the process to help translate things, challenges in manufacturing, or new steps we're [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1654.32s)]
*  about to take. Stage gate moving into, say, GMP from PD. And they can help partner and make sure [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1660.24s)]
*  that communication is clear. Because I think really one of the biggest challenges if you lose [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1665.2s)]
*  a step or there's a whisper down the lane somewhere away there, you can lose the client's sort of trust [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1669.2s)]
*  if all of a sudden the message is wrong coming through. So we put some safeguards in place to [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1675.68s)]
*  try to prevent that. Yeah. All right. Very good. I appreciate your objectivity and concrete examples [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1679.8400000000001s)]
*  in that response. Thank you, John. Jerry, I want to talk a little bit about the specifics of what [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1684.96s)]
*  Forge is doing for you. And I'm not even sure what the best way to go about posing this question is [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1690.56s)]
*  to you. But from what I understand, Forge is going to be supporting LifeBio's AAV process [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1694.88s)]
*  development, toxicology, CMGP manufacturing, and analytical services. So the way I frame it up is [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1700.0800000000002s)]
*  I just put it on your plate, Jerry, to tell me what considerations went into each of those four [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1710.48s)]
*  specific areas in your analysis of Forge's capabilities. So a little bit about the technical [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1715.44s)]
*  expertise, those will be working and the talent in the room or in the building. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1719.92s)]
*  And I think one of the things, and so we look at that in every company, right? And then the facility [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1725.68s)]
*  itself. If you haven't been there, you should really go visit their facility. I think it's, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1730.48s)]
*  as John was saying, and I'm not just saying it, but it's quite impressive. I think it was [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1736.72s)]
*  their collective learning of what they didn't like about a facility from how you enter a room, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1742.0s)]
*  something breaks down, you can fix it from the roof. If you want to keep a sterile room, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1746.8s)]
*  you can put material in a lock box that's separated from one room to the next so you [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1752.8s)]
*  don't lose time. There's a lot of really interesting things from a facility standpoint, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1757.52s)]
*  so that matters to us. And so the other thing that I think was a real attractive piece for Forge when [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1761.92s)]
*  we were looking at this versus others was they have their own therapeutic and development. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1771.12s)]
*  And so I assume they were making lots of learnings. We say mistakes, lots of learnings along the way [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1776.9599999999998s)]
*  that we'll benefit from. And so that was intriguing to us and very interesting that they [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1783.4399999999998s)]
*  were paving the way and putting their own money behind their own process, right? And they have [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1789.84s)]
*  their own therapeutic and development. So that made a difference from a toxicology standpoint [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1794.3999999999999s)]
*  to us and so the other processes. And then from a scale up, they are now, and boy, when we first [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1799.52s)]
*  started talking to you, it was knocking where it is today, but 500 liter, they were going to 500 [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1805.28s)]
*  liter and pretty, I think, John, you're now 5,000, right? So we could take it. And we have, as you [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1810.96s)]
*  were saying earlier, we have, for our optic neuropathy candidate, ADR100, we have a narrow [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1817.2s)]
*  base, NION, which is a stroke in the back of the eye, small numbers, but primary open-angle [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1823.52s)]
*  glaucoma is a large population that we think we can help. And so we're going to need scale eventually [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1829.04s)]
*  when we transition to commercial manufacturing. And the hope is we want to be able to stay in the [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  same facility. So that's another thing. And then also they started with more than one suite. There [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1839.36s)]
*  are CROs with only one suite. Something goes down, you're out of luck. Your timelines are [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1846.72s)]
*  shot. And for us, an executive in a biotech firm, time is my biggest enemy. Time is our cost of [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1853.28s)]
*  capital so high as a small biotech that we really time kills. And so they had three suites. And I [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1860.3999999999999s)]
*  think you're in excess of 15 now, John, at this point. Yeah, we have 20 operations. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1867.68s)]
*  Yeah. And so that really was another thing we looked at. And then the other, finally, and this [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1873.92s)]
*  gets back to once again, I think having their own therapeutic early on, they had their own methods [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1881.28s)]
*  internally. They outsource very few things, very few items, and it's micro, a certain micro that [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1884.8s)]
*  you would want to outsource anyway because you don't want to contaminate the facility. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1889.52s)]
*  So they had their own methods in place, which is another advantage. So as we looked, and I get back [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1893.84s)]
*  to once again that they were small, we were small in our own worlds. And for us, it was a perfect fit [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1901.28s)]
*  at our stage and where we were headed and where they were going. And so we've been able to watch [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1908.96s)]
*  them grow and as we advance. And we like to think we get the early mover attention now because we're [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1914.32s)]
*  one of the folks to go in. And that's important to us as well. So we had a chance to build strong [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1920.88s)]
*  relationships before they got to where they are today. Yeah, very good. Well, I do want to see it, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1925.3600000000001s)]
*  Jerry. You started this response out by saying you got to go down and check it out. I haven't seen it [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1931.04s)]
*  firsthand. I've had plenty of interaction with execs and folks from Forge. John, I mean, you're [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1935.52s)]
*  in Philly. I'm assuming you probably, when you go out to Columbus, you probably take a short flight [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1941.6s)]
*  over there. But if you ever drive, I live about halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh. So you drive [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1946.8799999999999s)]
*  right by my house on your way there. Just pick me up. We'll go out and have a look. I'm happy to [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1951.52s)]
*  grab you and come out for a tour. Yeah. I'm here every week. That sounds good. Yeah. I like to dig [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1956.16s)]
*  into sort of the finer points around contract negotiation for the benefit of our listeners, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1962.56s)]
*  our audience who perhaps haven't engaged an outsourced manufacturing partner just yet. We [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1968.72s)]
*  have a lot of folks who are R&D pre-clinical companies who are going to be traveling down [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1973.76s)]
*  this road. So let's talk about that for a little bit. When it came down, Jerry, post-vetting process [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1980.48s)]
*  we're dialed in. We like what Forge has got going on. We know they're capable. Now let's start [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1989.44s)]
*  hammering out some details in terms of what they're going to do for us and what we need them to do [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1993.44s)]
*  for us that perhaps they haven't seen before. What goes into that process for you, Jerry, in terms of [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=1997.76s)]
*  I guess the execution, not the execution, but the forging, if you will, of the contract? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2004.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we find this, so it's not too dissimilar to a CRO. We're going through that [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2011.84s)]
*  process now and you get wide ranges of pricing for the same activity and outcome. And then it's [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2018.08s)]
*  a matter of it's vetting through that process, right? And we not only had our internal experience, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2025.04s)]
*  but we relied, as I mentioned earlier, we brought in some independent consultants who had good [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2032.08s)]
*  pattern recognition on costs and variability and trends and habits of certain CDMOs in terms of [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2037.9199999999998s)]
*  how they charge, how they hit costs, not hit costs, but where the hidden costs were. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2047.2s)]
*  As we whittled it down, we had a good idea of the range from a negotiation, from a cost standpoint. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2052.48s)]
*  And then we also, it's not just negotiating price, but it's negotiating what's involved in services [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2059.44s)]
*  and along the way. And so we were able to continue to refine that. I think I mentioned that earlier, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2066.16s)]
*  refine the statement of work, but also refine the contract along the way. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2071.04s)]
*  So we became confident that we were within a reasonable range. And at the end of the day, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2076.8s)]
*  because at the end of the day, price is not the final decision because we could get the cheap, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2083.76s)]
*  if we went with the cheapest and it didn't work, we'd be out of business. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2087.2000000000003s)]
*  So I think from a pricing standpoint, we were able to get there. And from a work included [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2090.88s)]
*  and detail, we were able to get pretty much what we needed. Of course, there'll always be changes [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2095.04s)]
*  later. I'm sure we've made a number of changes to the work since then. So that was a good thing. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2099.76s)]
*  And then frankly, Forge was young and hungry and in a good way, they were aggressive. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2104.0s)]
*  I can say that now John knows that we sort of leveraged that to get a better deal. We were [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2111.68s)]
*  this poor little biotech company with a really cool, innovative technology. Wouldn't it be great [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2115.76s)]
*  if Forge, if you manufactured our product for us? So I think we were able to trim the edges a little [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2120.32s)]
*  bit there. Yeah. The salesman being sold. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2127.28s)]
*  John, what's your appetite for ... Jerry, maybe you can weigh in on this too and speak to any, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2134.0s)]
*  I don't know if you want to call them customization requests or proprietary requirements [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2142.88s)]
*  that, like I said, perhaps aren't cookie cutter like you'd see in a traditional biologics [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2149.12s)]
*  manufacturing agreement. So one, yeah, were there any sort of special requirements going [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2154.24s)]
*  into the engagement that John and his team had to mull over whether they could meet? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2161.12s)]
*  John, you want to take that? Yeah, I'm happy to, Jerry. And maybe there's a broader statement to [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2167.2s)]
*  this too is I think, Jerry said it best, as we're an emerging CDMO, and there are a lot of them, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2173.7599999999998s)]
*  right? We know there is a lot of good talent out there, a lot of great organizations to choose from. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2180.7999999999997s)]
*  I think though where some of the larger ones especially tend to get caught up is the formality [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2187.2s)]
*  of the deal making business. And I think where we get lost and where we can lose good technologies [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2193.6s)]
*  is rigidity this early on. I think the way Jerry said it, we were very hungry to have great [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2200.56s)]
*  technologies with good management teams come in and really to have high probability of success [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2206.48s)]
*  moving into IND. We really looked at these constructs very carefully and trying to give [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2213.6s)]
*  advice early on, hey, sequencing looks a little off in these particular sections. If we're asked [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2218.96s)]
*  to do that, we're happy to do consulting upfront if it means the ability to get to work with these [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2224.7999999999997s)]
*  clients. So in life's case and others, we have good optionality for flexibility on multiple fronts. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2229.92s)]
*  And obviously there's a business to run, so we have to maintain certain margins and cover costs, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2238.7999999999997s)]
*  but we took a tat Mac where we're not only trying to be very transparent, we include pass-through [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2243.44s)]
*  costs in our numbers. We don't charge specific management fees and things that don't look like [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2250.2400000000002s)]
*  real charge items. Those are things we didn't care about when we worked with CDIMOs in the past. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2256.08s)]
*  Or there's a small fine print to add 40% because passers, we want to make sure one, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2261.44s)]
*  the pricing is very transparent so it's straight through. And yeah, we absolutely negotiate on the [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2265.92s)]
*  front end, especially with our early partners about terms and things like that, just because [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2271.6s)]
*  we think we wanted good signs through the shop and why don't we get them there. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2277.2799999999997s)]
*  If you get a number of those heading into late stage and then potential commercial, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2281.8399999999997s)]
*  you show them a good relationship, you're all under one roof, I want then Jerry to bring his [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2285.92s)]
*  next program today, right? So a lot of gene therapy companies work on a platform, right? And so if I [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2290.88s)]
*  have multiple products that are running the same manufacturing process with a different gene of [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2296.64s)]
*  interest, that's less quality work because the batch records are the same and the release [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2301.3599999999997s)]
*  criteria is similar. The PPQ runs at the end of this are very straightforward. The CQAs during [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2306.0s)]
*  the process are so... So it's more repeatable work for us that we can deliver on really precisely, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2314.4s)]
*  but it's really opening the gate to that later larger opportunity that we really thought about [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2319.7599999999998s)]
*  at Forge. So for us, that means if there's some flexibility on front where we can stay on top of [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2325.84s)]
*  the margins, I think that's the best way that we create relationships early and grow the business. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2331.76s)]
*  And it's been successful. I believe we just, moving through our 50th client now that we've [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2336.4s)]
*  just picked up recently and really able to grow the business base because of that philosophy. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2342.0s)]
*  So this deal and others, try to work with the client, find the best outcomes. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2348.6400000000003s)]
*  Perform DOE studies, try different opportunities. We can do [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2355.68s)]
*  assets developments, things that aren't on a typical platform only approach. These are example [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2362.48s)]
*  things that we can do to Alucard to help the development process on top of the original [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2367.9199999999996s)]
*  negotiational work we do. Right. Yeah. Jerry, what's your best advice, like I said, for folks who [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2373.2s)]
*  are in your position on your org chart, but haven't done this before? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2379.52s)]
*  Yeah. So I think it's one, you have to have an outstanding internal head of CMC and we have one [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2385.12s)]
*  of Michelle Wachie. He's been doing it for 20 years, gene therapy and other areas. He knows [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2392.16s)]
*  his stuff. That said, I would highly advise bringing in outside consultants to help you [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2397.52s)]
*  run the process internally because when you're in a small biotech, that's time away from the day-to-day [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2404.0s)]
*  operation and it's worth a little bit of investment to help run a more fulsome process. I think we owe [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2411.68s)]
*  it to our investors. I think we owe it to the board and the company and the success of the project to [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2416.96s)]
*  run a fulsome process and learn and go through that. It's a little extra work upfront, but when [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2421.12s)]
*  you start with that, as we started out 12 to 15 months ahead of time and well down, we had a high [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2426.48s)]
*  degree of confidence and when it was time to pull the trigger on the milestone event, as I talked [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2430.8s)]
*  about earlier, we knew it was Forge we wanted to work with and it was just a matter of finalizing [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2435.2000000000003s)]
*  the contract. And so we had little wasted time in the end because we had a lot of confidence [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2439.52s)]
*  in our decision. So I think that's something, if I'm speaking to other CEOs or other execs or other [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2443.84s)]
*  heads of CMC, don't be afraid to bring someone in to help in the process. It's worth every dollar [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2449.52s)]
*  spent. When you're talking about an investment for us, there was a substantial proportion of [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2454.48s)]
*  remaining cash to go out and invest in the manufacturing. So that's my biggest advice. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2460.24s)]
*  And then I would say also, really understand, one of the larger CDMOs may be the right place [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2466.3199999999997s)]
*  for certain companies, but understand what your culture, your internal talent and how that matches [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2472.0s)]
*  up with your potential partner. One final thing we need to talk about, but I think it's important, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2479.9199999999996s)]
*  and I think too often, and this is something to self-reflect on companies and how to keep [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2485.44s)]
*  yourselves accountable. We always want to push and not blame, but hold the CDMO or the CRO [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2490.1600000000003s)]
*  accountable. But there's also internal processes within your own company that if you're not [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2495.92s)]
*  communicating with the CDMO, how do you expect them to fully help you and solve problems? So [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2503.36s)]
*  I think we have a great team that takes that very seriously. If something happens, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2510.32s)]
*  I had a discussion with our senior VP at CMC today and I asked, I said, what do you really like? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2514.8799999999997s)]
*  What are one or two best things about working with Forge? And he said, it's a true partnership. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2521.2s)]
*  And he said the project manager's top notch. And that's where it falls down. If you don't have [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2526.56s)]
*  the senior exec within your company having an open and honest relationship with the project [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2533.2s)]
*  manager on the other side, everything breaks down. Because typically problems aren't with [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2540.88s)]
*  people in the day-to-day operation. It's typically process and relationship and communication at a [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2546.88s)]
*  higher level. So that's the next thing that has to happen. And that's accountability on both sides of [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2551.6800000000003s)]
*  the equation. I think that's where sometimes small companies like mine, they make mistake and you're [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2555.76s)]
*  so busy day-to-day and you're limited staff that you forget about those important parts of what a [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2560.4s)]
*  partnership is. It's a two-way partnership, not a one-way partnership. Right. I've got a couple [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2565.84s)]
*  questions for you on the partnership angle and what that looks like from a day-to-day execution [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2570.32s)]
*  standpoint. But before I go there, you made an interesting point, Jerry, and I might be making [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2576.56s)]
*  this up in my head, but it seems to me. So you said, hey, this is a significant portion of the [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2580.88s)]
*  remaining cash that we have at this stage in our company that we're going to spend. We're going to [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2587.28s)]
*  spend money on Forge. Is there sort of an inflection when you sign on with a CDMO? Obviously, you do [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2590.6400000000003s)]
*  that at a very important stage in your company when there's some confidence that you've got [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2599.76s)]
*  something that's manufacturable, literally. Is there an inflection or like a nuance there, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2604.32s)]
*  like where when you spend that money, it might be a catalyst to bringing in more money? Does it have [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2610.1600000000003s)]
*  an impact? Does this decision have any impact on your investment community, on the capital that [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2617.84s)]
*  you raise next? Well, I think it does, even though it's not bringing you to like a clinical [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2625.12s)]
*  endpoint, value inflection point. One, it demonstrates, because you wouldn't start the [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2630.56s)]
*  manufacturing unless you were financed to cover your day-to-day clinical development operations, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2634.88s)]
*  but also your non-clinical development operations plus your manufacturing. But I think it gives [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2640.0s)]
*  confidence to future investors that they're going to walk into a situation where they have [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2645.04s)]
*  they have material for preclinical and phase one, right? That they're not having to make that [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  investment. So that's risk, it's both from a cost and time perspective, but also from a [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2656.4s)]
*  development risk perspective that when they come in, that is all taken off the table. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2662.1600000000003s)]
*  So that's how we've positioned it. I think if I look at risks in biotech companies, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2667.76s)]
*  time, money, and execution, and that takes something major off the table, particularly [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2673.84s)]
*  in the gene therapy way, this is not simple manufacturing. Yeah. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2678.88s)]
*  Yeah, Matt, maybe just to add to Jerry's point, it's not uncommon for us to be on with our [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2682.8s)]
*  clients and investors. I think CMC, as they know, being one of the biggest challenges in [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2689.12s)]
*  advanced therapies and gene therapy, notably, they want to feel confident that we're a good [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2693.6800000000003s)]
*  partner and that we know what we're doing and also some of our historical experiences. So [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2699.04s)]
*  it's an interesting point Jerry makes, although we always talk about non-clin endpoints and [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2704.64s)]
*  clinical endpoints and trial designs and enrollment rates. I think they recognize, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2710.96s)]
*  especially in this field, CMC needs to be well buttoned up with regulatory vetting for us to [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2715.68s)]
*  make a substantial investment. So not an uncommon ask, even at the CDMO front. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2721.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. All right. I'm glad there was some substance to those answers because I didn't know if that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2726.3199999999997s)]
*  question made any sense at all. So the partnership thing, what is that? Jerry touched on it, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2730.64s)]
*  right? Like he said, he asked his CMC director what's important here, and he said the partnership, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2739.52s)]
*  and you got a top-notch project manager. What does that look like on the day-to-day for your [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2747.2799999999997s)]
*  head of CMC, Jerry, and for your team that's working, John, your team that's working on [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2753.7599999999998s)]
*  Jerry's project. How accessible are they to one another? Are the doors open? Can Jerry and his [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2759.52s)]
*  head of CMC stop in? Jerry already told us he likes to snoop around your break room and observe [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2767.12s)]
*  your employees going about their business. You didn't know that, right? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2772.32s)]
*  Which I don't blame you on that. But what is that? What's acceptable in terms of transparency and [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2776.08s)]
*  access to what's going on at Forge? Yeah. And I think it's an important relationship builder. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2782.64s)]
*  Every CDMO has different roles. Some are very stringent and some are very, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2791.6s)]
*  right, more collaborative. We tend to be more on the collaborative side. So there's certain levels [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2796.96s)]
*  of ways we work at Forge. Everyone is assigned what we call a client relations partner, who is the [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2802.72s)]
*  project manager that Jerry is referring to. They're also assigned an internal PMO. So we [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2808.4s)]
*  actually have an internal project manager who sort of manages the project internally. We have someone [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2813.28s)]
*  who's the liaison with the client. And then they work collectively to make sure we have consistent [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2818.4s)]
*  and frequent communications. I believe in the case of life, there's a weekly call where they keep up, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2825.6800000000003s)]
*  especially in times of heightened manufacturing or development. They may change cadence times [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2833.04s)]
*  depending on different parts of the development. But we try to make sure that we're having [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2838.64s)]
*  regular communications, transparent communications. So if there is an issue, we need them to know [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2843.2799999999997s)]
*  right away. And then we can work through the problem together. One of the worst things you [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2848.24s)]
*  can do as an organization is to go off and try to figure it out and then go tell the client, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2852.16s)]
*  right? That creates just a distrust that nobody wants to manage during it changes the tone of the [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2856.32s)]
*  relationship. So we make sure we try to do that quite openly. We do have a fairly, I think, liberal [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2861.6s)]
*  PIP program, which is a person in plant. We do encourage our clients to be here during major [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2868.88s)]
*  operations and view the process. We have angles you can actually watch visually. There's camera [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2874.3199999999997s)]
*  angles, like we have in closed circuit cameras to watch. But it gives them the ability then to [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2881.36s)]
*  observe and see us in action, how we work, ask questions, and be there when we're live during [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2886.72s)]
*  very critical parts of the process. I get that. Being a CEO of a small biotech before this, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2893.6s)]
*  you really want to be close to where your critical risk points are. So we obviously make sure we can [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2900.72s)]
*  give that option to clients to be able to do that. And then we try to meet on routine JSCs. I think [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2907.52s)]
*  that's where decisions can be made. It's a bit more formal at the meeting. Formalize the [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2913.04s)]
*  communication of data updates, next steps, how they are working together, feedback for forage, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2918.32s)]
*  the things you like to see done better. That's a great place for me and the CTO and the CRO to [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2924.16s)]
*  really sit and listen and hear about how the relationship is growing. Or if there are really [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2929.7599999999998s)]
*  good things, take that learning and use it in other clients. So it's a great way for us to learn [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2933.36s)]
*  more about interactions with our trusted partners that come in. So that's the format that we try to [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2937.68s)]
*  work with clients and try to maintain that. As I mentioned, it can evolve over the course. If [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2944.24s)]
*  they're in the middle of their trial and they're dosing patients and we're really not on the hot [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2951.04s)]
*  plate for the moment, we may need on a little less regular basis, but we do keep in touch during those [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2956.0s)]
*  times as well. Make sure we're just fulfilling the needs of the program. And then we also [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2961.52s)]
*  give those opportunities to ask, do you have a next program? And if you're interested in working [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2967.44s)]
*  with Forge again, let's start some pre-planning there because you know how it is, queues can be [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2971.04s)]
*  long sometimes, there could be some opportunities. So we like to get ahead of those and try to make [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2975.76s)]
*  sure we're meeting their needs for timing and their boards and their investors needs as well. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2979.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Do you have anything to add there? No, I just, because I've been part of the joint [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2984.4s)]
*  committees and what's nice, it is more formal and you're giving project updates. And so in [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2991.04s)]
*  addition to our SVP CMC, we have our CSO, our chief scientific officer there and myself as the [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=2996.16s)]
*  CEO. So it's a business update, it's a process update. And what's nice, even in those situations, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3002.24s)]
*  I think the last time we were there, we were able to identify a challenge that was on the table. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3008.16s)]
*  And it just organically turns into a brainstorming session. Our chief scientific officers, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3012.48s)]
*  very, very good at problem solving. And before you know it, she and John were having a discussion. And [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3019.52s)]
*  I think within a day we saw that ended up not being much at all, right? So, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3024.88s)]
*  because you're constantly running into, this is the nature of our business in biotech, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3030.4s)]
*  whether it's clinical development, whether it's HR, whether it's manufacturing, it's constant speed [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3033.44s)]
*  bumps and questions and challenges that we have to solve. And yeah, you build a better relationship [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3040.16s)]
*  that way. So I think that's a, I'm not sure that's only forged doing that, but I think it's an [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3045.7599999999998s)]
*  important part of the process. And if I were to speak to other execs, it's important that you [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3052.32s)]
*  invest the time and energy to build those relationships and keep yourself involved at that [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3056.56s)]
*  level. That, like you gave that specific challenge example, is the ability to come together and [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3062.48s)]
*  tackle a challenge, we'll continue using the word challenge and not call it a problem. In a client [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3070.8s)]
*  contractor relationship, you can easily call things problems. Is the approach to addressing [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3077.92s)]
*  challenges inherently baked into the fact that we're in a scientific industry and everyone wants [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3086.56s)]
*  to collaboratively and civilly solve scientific problems, or is there more to that story? Like, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3092.96s)]
*  you know, is it just baked into your head of CMC and your chief scientific officer, Jerry, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3099.84s)]
*  they just know that they're going to see things over there at Forge that confound them. And we're [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3105.52s)]
*  going to have to get together and figure them out. We're not going to get mad about it. We're not [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3111.84s)]
*  going to be displeased with our service. We're not going to be displeased with their subject matter [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3114.88s)]
*  expertise. We're going to solve the problem because we're scientists and that's what we do. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3119.12s)]
*  Yeah. I will say this, Matt, and I'll turn it over to John. I would get nervous if we don't see [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3122.8s)]
*  challenges in our day-to-day operation. If a week goes by and we don't have some issue that comes to [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3128.08s)]
*  the forefront, whether it's in manufacturing or in clinical development or an assay or you name it, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3133.36s)]
*  right? It would be surprising to me. That's the nature of our job. Keep making forward progress [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3137.92s)]
*  while solving problems along the way. And so I think it's expected. I think you nailed it. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3143.2000000000003s)]
*  It's the nature of our business where we have hypotheses around science and technology and [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3148.32s)]
*  we're moving them along in the process. So it's constantly an examination of, you know, an [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3154.88s)]
*  examination of the business and also looking at potential speed bumps along the way. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3161.84s)]
*  Yeah. I'll add to that, Matt. It's why I mentioned to connect quickly and transparently with the [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3169.28s)]
*  client. Those are two more brains that we get to now access to talk about the challenge. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3176.96s)]
*  And of course, we make sure we collect the right data so we can have a call and walk through what [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3182.08s)]
*  we found, make sure the data is clear and engage on a solution. We also like to come with solutions [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3186.48s)]
*  to those meetings. So we usually pretty rapidly meet and say, okay, here are two or three options [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3193.28s)]
*  that we can do. One might be one path that might take a little longer, but maybe a little more [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3198.56s)]
*  straightforward from a documentation standpoint. One might be quicker, but you know, have to get [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3203.92s)]
*  some reads from the quality units to see their comfort levels. You know, generally we always [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3207.92s)]
*  make the right decision for, you know, quality, safety, and that's really, you know, and potency [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3212.48s)]
*  as we're thinking about drugs, but it's best to do those collectively with the client and make sure [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3217.6s)]
*  everyone's on the same page. Luckily, a lot of our clients are very seasoned scientists in the [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3222.64s)]
*  cell and gene therapy space. Now we do have some clients who don't have that, unfortunately. That's [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3228.8s)]
*  why Jerry's advice for hiring CMC internally is a very good piece of advice for early organizations. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3233.68s)]
*  Sometimes they're small and they're in their seed grounds and they're looking for some early advice. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3240.16s)]
*  We try to come with solutions and advice with those as well. And you know, that's sometimes a [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3244.24s)]
*  little bit more of a challenge, but we always love the luxury of we're actually working with a really [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3250.16s)]
*  great technical team on the other side here. Let's get together and walk through these now, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3254.16s)]
*  make sure they hear what we're sort of being challenged with, and then use our expertise to [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3258.96s)]
*  try to self-collect. Yeah. We're going to run short on time here, guys. You okay for a couple more? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3263.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, sounds good. All right, good. And the next thing I want to ask you about, I hesitate to ask [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3269.6s)]
*  you about, I love to talk about culture and we've hinted at it. There's been a thread of culture [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3275.68s)]
*  throughout this entire conversation. And I love talking about culture and cultural match and [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3284.4s)]
*  cultural fits, but at the same time, it's a hard thing to quantify, right? It's a hard thing to say, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3290.3199999999997s)]
*  well, because we have this tight culture and it works out, that's why we're going to save or make [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3297.44s)]
*  money, right? You can't connect those dots easily. But I do want to stop there for a minute and talk [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3303.76s)]
*  about this because I do think it's important for our listeners again, who perhaps are seeing some [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3311.04s)]
*  of this for the first time or about to, to understand what the value of a good cultural [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3316.32s)]
*  fit is beyond, you know, Jerry thinks John's a pretty fun guy to have a beer with, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3321.7599999999998s)]
*  but he's not necessarily real good at running an outsource manufacturing company. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3326.72s)]
*  So to whatever degree you can, you know, reflecting on the past year working together, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3332.72s)]
*  can you point to any anecdotes or examples of, you know, the value of a good cultural fit? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3338.96s)]
*  I know it's a, it's a hard question to be like, yeah, I can ascribe a specific value to that, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3347.04s)]
*  but you get what I'm going for. Yeah. I mean, maybe I'll start Matt, just a little bit, because [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3352.88s)]
*  there's sort of two aspects. One is internal culture and Forge, because I can't generate a [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3360.0s)]
*  culture with a client unless I have a good internal culture here. And we, over the last [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3365.7599999999998s)]
*  two years have grown to 370 plus people. So, you know, maintaining culture when we were 100 people [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3371.28s)]
*  is a challenge as we grow this side. Interestingly enough, taking over, I started working on some [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3378.1600000000003s)]
*  internal culture philosophies around how we actually interact, not only internally, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3384.0800000000004s)]
*  but with clients. So really establishing some new pillars and Forge of what's important to us about [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3388.6400000000003s)]
*  how we work together, work with, you know, our clients. And ultimately at the top of these [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3393.76s)]
*  pillars are patients, which is why we're on the call here talking about why these relationships [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3397.84s)]
*  are important, because we ultimately want to help really sick people, you know, get better. So in [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3402.7200000000003s)]
*  there we're talking, you know, these pillars have to do with keep my people internally, making sure [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3407.28s)]
*  they're in a great environment where they have growth and well-protected, safe environment, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3412.08s)]
*  but also room for its growth in their own careers. And then operational excellence, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3417.36s)]
*  so clients are actually receiving high quality product in the time they believe that they need [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3421.92s)]
*  them and moving forward. Quality is another pillar we're really focused on making sure quality [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3426.64s)]
*  mindedness is a big part of our organization. And then clients, because we are in an organization [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3431.2s)]
*  where we have to service our clients and make sure they have the attention and the sort of, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3436.96s)]
*  you know, part of Forge they need to make sure their products are being moved forward. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3441.52s)]
*  So that's what I'm using going forward to create this more, you know, operational feeling at Forge [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3445.7599999999998s)]
*  as we move in the late stage commercial. So then take that back to like working with Jerry and his [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3450.7999999999997s)]
*  team, you know, if we can't even communicate properly on a call, we don't have the same values [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3456.16s)]
*  that sometimes does make a really difficult working situation. And if, you know, if the client is just [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3462.64s)]
*  ready, wants to move forward and, you know, we're worried about like, you know, this is not a real [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3469.12s)]
*  world example, but I'll give you a, for instance, if a client had a program where I felt it was [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3473.52s)]
*  unsafe, you know, that's something that we would have to have that conversation. That might not be [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3478.08s)]
*  the right culture to work with that particular client, right? Innovation teams like Jerry's, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3481.84s)]
*  that's where we all meet together. And I think that's why we have such a good working relationship. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3487.6000000000004s)]
*  Jerry, I hope you don't mind, but like, I went to one of their quarterly meetings to talk about [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3492.6400000000003s)]
*  Forge and introduce it to his staff in Philadelphia. And that's an access for me that I really enjoy. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3497.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, I want them to know I got a chance to listen to their team and listen, watch how they [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3504.1600000000003s)]
*  work together. And it's just, that's something that I think creates another level of a relationship. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3510.24s)]
*  And I think it's really important in our industry, quite frankly, to make sure we're all rolling the [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3514.7999999999997s)]
*  boat the same way for helping patients and kids. Yeah, that's good. I've seldom sort of [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3519.4399999999996s)]
*  contemplated the cultural aspect. I spend all my time talking to sponsors, very, very little [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3525.04s)]
*  talking to outsource manufacturers. I seldom contemplate the fact that you have the right, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3529.8399999999997s)]
*  John, to say, you know what, your culture doesn't fit with this facility. So [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3534.0s)]
*  better go find somebody that does, right? Yeah. Jerry, anything to add? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3539.68s)]
*  Well, I think it's, well, so that example of John coming to our company, we pride ourselves and we [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3544.48s)]
*  have an initiative and mission to be a learning organization, whether you're in, you're a technical [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3550.4s)]
*  expert or not. And so at our, we have quarterly all hands meetings, we're bringing the whole [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3554.8s)]
*  company together for a couple of days. And we always dedicate a meaningful amount of time [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3559.68s)]
*  to learning. And that learning could be an ophthalmologist coming in and talking about [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3565.12s)]
*  glaucoma, could be a gene therapy expert. In this case, we have our legal team, our finance team, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3568.72s)]
*  the office manager, they know Forge by emails and paperwork, right? And bills, but they don't know [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3577.04s)]
*  John and they don't know what's under the hood. And we thought it'd be a great idea. And John was [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3583.6s)]
*  very eager and agreed to come and give us a dimension, help them understand further. That [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3588.48s)]
*  Forges the relationship, no pun intended, even further. When you have not only our head of CMC [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3594.64s)]
*  and our chief scientific officer and myself who spend more time with John and his team, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3601.04s)]
*  but the rest of the organization, they become more invested, they understand. And once again, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3605.2s)]
*  it's such a critical component to us. So it's part of the organization being learning. And then we [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3610.64s)]
*  have a philosophy, and I'm very fortunate that our senior exec team, and I think it's where, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3615.04s)]
*  frankly, many folks miss, is treat your, quote unquote, we like to say sometimes the entry [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3621.92s)]
*  vendors, but treat your vendors truly, not just as partners, but as part of the team. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3629.2s)]
*  So take the partner out, they are members of the team. You invest time and energy in them, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3633.2799999999997s)]
*  and you'll get more back in terms of mind space and share of their energy and commitment than you [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3639.28s)]
*  could ever imagine. And so if you treat the CDMO, the CRO, your other consultants with a lot of [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3646.32s)]
*  respect and include them in a broader aspect of the company, help them understand more what your [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3652.16s)]
*  challenges are and what your opportunities are, it then, I think, helps them give more back to the [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3656.4s)]
*  organization. So we spend, probably spend a little more sometimes on consultants in some of these [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3663.76s)]
*  situations more time, but for us as a small company that's virtual, I can't imagine doing [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3668.32s)]
*  anything out of the way. It's the only way I think we can operate, have operational excellence. And [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RS3YohL_dE&t=3674.2400000000002s)]
