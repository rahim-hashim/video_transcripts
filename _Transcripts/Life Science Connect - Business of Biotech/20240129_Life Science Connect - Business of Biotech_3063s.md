Video Description: The Business of Biotech took a trip to San Francisco for the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, that most target-richest of environments for those of us who like talking shop with biotech builders. The results of that trip will feed the next several weeks of Business of Biotech podcast programming, and we're kicking things off with everyone's favorite life sciences CFO, Allan Shaw. On this episode, Allan shares what's driving the cautious optimism for biotech's return, pointing to factors like December's flurry of M&A activity, interest rate reductions, and easing inflation as just cause for the bullish sentiment that was palpable at the conference. We also discuss what could shift the tailwinds, namely the election year wildcard, and why biotech could benefit from a metered comeback. Come for the facts, stay for the Shawisms!

*  Biotech is making a comeback. That's the word from San Francisco during JPMorgan Week anyway. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=40.16s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. This is the business of biotech, and I was there to hear it firsthand [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=46.64s)]
*  at what's inarguably the most target-rich environment in the world for a guy who likes [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=51.76s)]
*  talking to biotech leaders. I took full advantage. I racked up well over a dozen [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=56.96s)]
*  interviews with founders and CEOs and CBOs and CFOs, many of whom will feed our podcast lineup [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=62.24s)]
*  for weeks to come. These execs 201 brought facts, names, and numbers to back up their increasingly [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=69.12s)]
*  rosy market sentiments. Easing inflation, the promise of favorable interest rates, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=76.08s)]
*  and December's flurry of M&A activity are just a few pieces of key evidence pointing [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  to biotech's return. And speaking of returns, you know who else is making one? Everybody's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=86.72s)]
*  favorite biotech CFO, Alan Shaw. He was at the top of my list to catch up with in San Francisco, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=92.32s)]
*  and I'm thrilled that he made the time to make it happen. Let's give it a listen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=98.88s)]
*  So Alan Shaw, it's been far too long since you've been on the show, and I'm thrilled that we [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=102.64s)]
*  get to do this one face to face. So welcome back. Great to be back. Always great doing the show with [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=108.4s)]
*  you, and even better doing it in person. This is the first time we're not going through a screen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  I know it. I know it for sure. I'm thinking I need to start taking trips out to New York to record [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  with you so we can do it in person. We can do it on the beach. We can do all our fishing, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=127.76s)]
*  I think with technology, we can really do it almost anywhere. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=132.08s)]
*  We can. Yeah. So it's great to see you here. It's great to see you here in San Fran for JPM. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=134.72s)]
*  When did you get into town? I rolled in on a Sunday morning, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=140.4s)]
*  and I went immediately to a brunch reception. Yeah, right. Hit the ground running. So we've been, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=144.4s)]
*  I came in on Monday, but you've been going back to back, I'm sure, since you got here. What's the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=150.88s)]
*  prevailing sentiment that you're picking up right now? You know, I think first of all, just touching [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=157.76s)]
*  on what you said, JP Morgan has been and continues to be an endurance sport. You know, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=161.92s)]
*  you really almost have to treat yourself like an athlete to get it through the week and take care [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=167.76s)]
*  of yourself and remember to hydrate. You know, with that said, you know, the sentiment has been [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  interesting and I'd say really consistent across the board. You know, I'd say people are generally [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=178.48s)]
*  cautiously optimistic. You know, I would say that everyone would generally agree that the wind isn't [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=184.32s)]
*  in our face as it has been, but it's not necessarily to our back either. There's certainly [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=190.16s)]
*  reasons to be encouraged. You know, I think a lot of people have pointed to, you know, there's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=198.16s)]
*  certainly the rally at the end of the year that turned the XBI, which was almost like 30% down, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=203.6s)]
*  to break over as a positive, which was certainly encouraging. You know, with that said, I haven't [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=208.88s)]
*  found anyone who's kind of stood up and waved their hand saying, I was the one doing all the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=215.28s)]
*  buying. You know, I think there was a lot of short covering, so there's still, you know, but people [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=218.96s)]
*  are definitely warming up. There's evidence that there's more and more buy-side engagement, as one [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=224.8s)]
*  banker put it to me the other day. The buy-side aperture is getting a little bit wider. You know, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=232.72s)]
*  before people wouldn't even read your emails. Now they are reading the emails. So that's encouraging [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=239.84s)]
*  and certainly the fact that there was over 30 billion dollars of M&A in recent weeks has given [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=246.16s)]
*  people reason to be excited, particularly since it does suggest that it certainly reinforces the thesis [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=252.8s)]
*  that Big Pharma has some real pipeline issues that they're really going to have to solve these [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=261.6s)]
*  issues. Given that they're patent cliffs, they're about three, four, five years out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=265.76s)]
*  So there's obviously some aggressive buy-side actions. I think that's, and that money gets [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=270.0s)]
*  recycled typically back into the market. So that should again be a positive indicator and people [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=277.76s)]
*  would continue to look at that as a catalyst for the market to come back. I've heard some anecdotal [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  information that they're expecting almost 30 IPOs this year. You know, I think that's all going to be [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  conditional on the success of the first couple that go out. You know, some of the test IPOs and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=297.92s)]
*  if they trade well, I think, you know, are you going to see people pushing the IPOs out until [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  they break it again? That's what I was going to ask. Do you think if a forecast of 30 is feasible, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=310.16s)]
*  is that a healthy number? Because that constant, like it's just a regurgitation of the same [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=316.88s)]
*  conversation about how we were overpopulated with IPOs and that contributed to the mess. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=322.16s)]
*  I think it is a healthy, if we get there, I'm not sure if we, excuse me, get there particularly in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=328.8s)]
*  an election year. I certainly, I think the other side of the coin, white people are cautious, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=334.88s)]
*  white people don't think we're necessarily out of the woods but are feeling better is, you know, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=339.6s)]
*  is, well, there is a prospect of interest rate cuts and SPED certainly went out there in November [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=344.56s)]
*  and actually indicated there'd be a couple this year. And that really, I think in many respects, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=351.92s)]
*  triggered the short coverage that we saw in the XBI. And I think it's a question of whether or not [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=357.76s)]
*  they materialize. You know, we have low, inflation's getting lower. It's not at the target levels yet [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=363.12s)]
*  and employment seems to be pretty good. You know, people are calling a soft landing. So [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=369.52s)]
*  I'm not sure if you need interest rates to stimulate the economy. The economy seems to be [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=374.48s)]
*  working pretty well. And when you look at interest rates on a historical level, we're right in the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  middle of a fairway. I'm not sure what all necessarily the noise is other than people [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=382.4s)]
*  have been spoiled by free money for over a decade. And I think they want their toys back. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=387.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good way to put it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  I would also say, you know, in terms of the M&A, the other side, you know, where they're there, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=398.32s)]
*  while people are highly encouraged by what's going on, you know, the FTC continually seems to get in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=402.88s)]
*  the way of things. You know, they had blocked the Amgen Horizon trade for a long time. And it really [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  seemed to be misguided. You know, they had issues about the PBMs and drug pricing and how they have [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=416.8s)]
*  products get bundled. And rather than getting in the way of M&A, which is part of the natural [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=423.68s)]
*  life cycle of the industry, they should have been going after the PBMs if they didn't like the way [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=428.32s)]
*  that was working. So, you know, it seemed to me really misguided in terms of how they were [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=433.12s)]
*  approaching it. And then they, you know, they finished the year deciding to pick another battle [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=439.76s)]
*  that made no sense, which caused Sanofi to back away from a licensing deal, of all things. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=443.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, they've got to kind of get their policy on order. And I'm sure with the election [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=451.6s)]
*  coming up, this is the year to expect significant rational behavior from these folks. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=457.68s)]
*  Yeah. You mentioned, you know, the impact of the election. You explained that for me. Like, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=462.24s)]
*  what sort of an impact should we expect or might we expect? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=468.16s)]
*  Now, fair enough. If people can recall back to the, it was like the 20s, 17, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=473.76s)]
*  during the election that Hillary ran against Trump. I forget what year it was now. But if you recall [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=484.64s)]
*  that biotech was having a pretty good run until Hillary hit the Twitter with negative [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=493.52s)]
*  biopharmaceutical sentiment in terms of policy and other things. And it really put a chill [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=501.76s)]
*  in the sector. And we really traded off for the second half of 2015 going into 2016. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  And I know I tried to launch, I did launch an IPO during that period of time. And I'll never [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=518.0s)]
*  forget that the front page of the Wall Street Journal, the day we were seeking board approval [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=523.6s)]
*  was IPO market closed. My son asked me, why are you laughing? I said, you don't understand [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  the day I'm about to have. And this is the narrative. But, you know, we got it done. But [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=532.08s)]
*  it's that political rhetoric. It's the platitudes of the tweets. You know, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  former biotech seems to be the politician's favorite whipping boy, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  which is kind of ironic when you think about the contribution and impact on humanity that the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=550.24s)]
*  industry has provided. Arguably, it's more profound than what all the foreign aid that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  we send and all the military stuff that we send. But nonetheless, you know, and the negative [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=561.76s)]
*  sentiment that we get, you know, we do bring it on when we keep increasing prices on products [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  that have been around for years, annually or semi-annually by three, four percent, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=574.88s)]
*  you know, which is choking the bear in the eye. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. There were there was a panel yesterday. There was a panel yesterday at the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=582.48s)]
*  end of the day on that sentiment. You know, the fact that biotech and pharma are on par [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  in the public purview with tobacco and oil and gas. Right. Like, it's so interesting to me during [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=594.96s)]
*  COVID, you know, when COVID happened, it was like there was the spike in sentiment, a positive spike, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=601.9200000000001s)]
*  and then very quickly that evaporated. How do you like, what are your, that's a general question. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=607.5200000000001s)]
*  What are your thoughts on how an industry sustains, you know, at least a semi-positive [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=611.76s)]
*  public perception? Yeah. You know, it's certainly easier said than done. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=617.84s)]
*  You know, I think we need to be seen more as advocates for the patient population, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=624.4000000000001s)]
*  as opposed to people that seem to be taking advantage of the patient population. And when [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=634.48s)]
*  you're just raising prices and then, you know, and it's all part of the rebate cycle and how [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=639.2s)]
*  you get yourself positioned, you know, the patients are losing in that situation. And then, you know, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=645.2s)]
*  the PBMs and the industry, you know, bringing it on themselves. You know, I think, you know, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=651.36s)]
*  as we start to look at patient engagement, holistic solutions, you know, I could see the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=656.32s)]
*  industry being helpful in that level of engagement. You know, I think there's efforts now to kind of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=663.36s)]
*  cut out the middleman. And I think the cutting out the middleman, like the PBMs and going direct, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=670.08s)]
*  is going to allow us to kind of reallocate things the right way, as opposed to paying the middleman [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=675.28s)]
*  for very little value added at the end of the day, other than it's been the way we conduct business, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=681.52s)]
*  like night follows day. I would say, you know, if you take a step back, a much more holistic look, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  you know, the healthcare spend in the United States is highest in the world. Yet, you know, our [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=694.48s)]
*  outcomes and mortality rates are some of the lowest ones. So, you know, so effectively, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  we're paying more for less. And, you know, I think, you know, we should be advocates for trying to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=711.36s)]
*  make the appropriate changes in the system, because what we got right now isn't sustainable. It's [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=717.2800000000001s)]
*  really broken, you know, and what industry, you know, and I think that's going to result in us [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  taking much more of a risk-based approach to the products that we sell. And as some of these other [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=728.56s)]
*  products become almost like services, you know, when you're looking at gene editing and you're [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=734.4799999999999s)]
*  looking at cell therapy, I mean, you're providing services, you're providing solutions now, and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=738.16s)]
*  you're providing outcomes. And I think that'll be helpful in changing the narrative. But, you know, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  and I think probably highlighting and figuring out how we can educate people on the contributions, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=750.64s)]
*  you know, on the lives that we're saving and the impact on people. And there's a lot of beautiful [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=757.92s)]
*  stories out there. They don't seem to be out there. People aren't really aware of that. So, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=766.56s)]
*  you know, we probably need a new publicist, but I think actions speak louder than words. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=772.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking about our conversation before we started recording. And I was, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=776.16s)]
*  obviously, I want to spend some time talking about your perception of the markets and the industry, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=783.28s)]
*  but with the headwind, you know, allegedly going away, to your point, maybe not at our back [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=787.5200000000001s)]
*  quite yet. I was wondering, what are you and I going to commiserate about if things get better? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=794.48s)]
*  But you're giving me plenty of fodder for that. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=801.36s)]
*  I mean, I think, you know, I don't think everybody's a winner or a loser, you know. I [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=804.96s)]
*  don't think this is necessarily, you know, you're flicking a switch and things are going to go back [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=809.6s)]
*  to the roaring 2020s. I don't necessarily anticipate that. I think people are going to [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=815.92s)]
*  be a lot more discerning. I think we still have a lot of companies that are kind of walking zombies [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=823.92s)]
*  out there. And there's going to have to be, you know, a come to Jesus moment for them in terms [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=830.4s)]
*  of whether or not they'll be able to continue to execute. I think people have to still, I guess, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=835.92s)]
*  take their medicine and those who take their medicine, who skinny down and focus on what they [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=841.84s)]
*  need to focus on, will get to the other end. You know, I think this is a time to be a bit scrappy. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  So as things change, I think it's not going to go back. I don't anticipate it going back to where [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  it was. So it's going to be a lot more emphasis on management teams. You know, I think when, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=862.0s)]
*  you know, we chatted during good times too. I remember talking about the boy bands of biotech [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=868.32s)]
*  as we were marching, putting management teams, a wrap together and newly formed companies and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=873.44s)]
*  pushing them out the door. So, you know, I think it's going to kind of get back to more fundamentals. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=879.52s)]
*  I think that people are going to put more fundamental emphasis on the quality of the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=884.24s)]
*  management team. I think we've seen and I've said this before and I'll emphasize it again, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=887.76s)]
*  that, you know, given the choice between a superior asset and a middling management team [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=893.2s)]
*  or a middling asset and a superior management team, I would always take the later [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=901.36s)]
*  because they'll know how to extract value. As a friend of mine put it, we were talking about this [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=909.2s)]
*  on breakfast today. He says, you know, these assets don't develop by themselves. And you need to be [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=914.0s)]
*  able to navigate the, myriad of different aspects. You know, you need to navigate the science and the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=919.76s)]
*  proof of concept. You need to be able to navigate the manufacturing. You need to manage the accrual [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=928.88s)]
*  rates of clinical trials. You know, I've observed a fundamental difference in the way people execute [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=934.72s)]
*  on these things and I've seen them generate good results and I've seen them not generate as good [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=941.28s)]
*  of a results. So I think it's going to really put more of an emphasis on execution. And I think for [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=946.32s)]
*  good science, for good teams, if you can execute, there'll be an opportunity there, you know, as [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=954.08s)]
*  we've said before in God, we trust in data belief and it's just going to be really getting back to [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=961.36s)]
*  basics. Yeah. Do you see, like if you think about the overpopulation of biotechs pre, you know, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  bubble popping or whatever you want to call it, you talk a lot about, you know, jockeys and [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=976.96s)]
*  executing on management. Do you see like the pool of talent as being in a healthy place right now or [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  an improved place right now given that so many execs and founders have been battle tested? Or, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=991.6s)]
*  you know, what's your take on that? Like, do you think it's a good field of jockeys right now? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=998.96s)]
*  You know, I think we were stressed, stretched, I mean, and maybe stressed in terms of how we were [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1004.64s)]
*  populating these seats. You know, if somebody told me when I was younger, if you can't jump [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1011.84s)]
*  over the bar, you lower it. And I think the bars were lowered in many cases. And I think that also [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1018.0s)]
*  speaks to some of the things we've spoken about in past episodes about the productivity was, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1024.32s)]
*  there was a lot more clinical failures. And I think people were doing things because they could. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1029.76s)]
*  And the flow of money wasn't restrictive. So you were my partner, worry about getting invalidated, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1035.76s)]
*  I'll just do it all. And I think that the inexperience of people thinking that, you know, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1042.96s)]
*  a high tide is going to keep all the boats high, you know, people got caught out. So I actually see [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1048.56s)]
*  this as a period where companies who have the wherewithal, there's an opportunity for them to [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1053.44s)]
*  upgrade their management teams and their organization. Because I think there's still [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1059.3600000000001s)]
*  a bit of a mismatch. I think you still got, you know, a ridiculous number of companies out there [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1068.24s)]
*  that are that are that are under underwater. And as I understand it, additionally, there's at least [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1074.24s)]
*  130 companies that are trying to go public. So even if the 30 of those that we talked about get out, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1081.28s)]
*  what about the other the other folks? And as I think you touched on before someone touched on [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1087.76s)]
*  that now they're making reverse mergers a little bit more restrictive as well. Well, you know, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1091.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't think it'll be a big issue, but it's just not helpful. And, you know, the I think the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1096.64s)]
*  reverse mergers was one way to kind of help clean up the system. You know, the way I saw it is you [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1104.72s)]
*  can do 30 IPOs, but if you got over 100 150 companies that are broken, you know, you should [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1110.72s)]
*  be able to match those up with the companies who want to go public and try to take a little pressure [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1117.0400000000002s)]
*  system. Yeah. But what I've also heard is because of this new discerning environment, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1122.6399999999999s)]
*  that there's a number of companies that have been funded by the fundamental specialist VCs [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1129.84s)]
*  who are the those investors are not re-upping and they're going to let them kind of just hit the [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1136.56s)]
*  wall or take a very soft landing. So I think that speaks to the fact that while that the bar needs [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1141.12s)]
*  to get raised, whether it's management teams, whether it's the science of the companies, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1149.92s)]
*  I think investors have lost a lot of money over the last several years. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1155.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think they're certainly very focused on self-preservation. And on that, and on that, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1159.44s)]
*  speaking about the financing environment, I think a lot of the deals that have been getting done, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1166.0800000000002s)]
*  a lot of these data pipes speaks to that. You know, a lot of companies are given a lot of upside. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1170.3200000000002s)]
*  Usually the play would be to announce the data and do a deal and the stock would re-rate itself. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1177.28s)]
*  Because of the market dynamics, people are now entering into these data pipes where you bring [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1183.92s)]
*  the investors over the wall. They get to kick the tires, see everything before anyone else. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1191.68s)]
*  You negotiate a deal. The deal is going to not necessarily provide the same level of valuation [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1197.84s)]
*  re-rating, but you've now got the money to do what else you need to do. You've got some [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1204.0s)]
*  validating investors in your cap table. And that seems to be the business right now. I think [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1210.08s)]
*  as something to watch as we cautiously approach optimistically the new year is to see whether [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1218.0s)]
*  or not those deals will be as prevalent or whether or not people can get back to doing [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1224.16s)]
*  final offerings without having to transact that way. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1228.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was going to ask you a question about that. Like the deal structure, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1231.68s)]
*  starting with a more scrupulous, I guess, investor base, right? More discerning as we've been saying. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1239.2s)]
*  And then the way that deals have been structured as investors become more discerning. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1245.6s)]
*  When cycles like this happen, what sticks? Like what carries on? Like tranche deals, for instance. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1253.28s)]
*  One, I want to get your perspective on what's been difficult in terms of the way the deals are [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1262.24s)]
*  being done now. But I'm also curious about as cycles like this happen, do terms that happen [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1268.96s)]
*  and down cycles tend to carry on or do they go away when things get better again? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1275.04s)]
*  Yeah. I think in a nutshell, it's really about supply and demand. And when you have a lack of [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1280.48s)]
*  supply, it's really a buyer's market and they can drive the terms. And I think looking at [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1287.12s)]
*  flow of funds will be really important, the return of the M&A dollars. Fund flow will dictate the [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1295.36s)]
*  demand side of the equation. And that keeps people honest. When you do any sort of [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1303.92s)]
*  market deal, you want demand. If you can drive demand, you can drive the terms. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1309.52s)]
*  If you don't have demand, the terms will be driven to you. So I think the terms right now are, again, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1313.68s)]
*  I think more in the side of the investor. But I would say it's there, but nothing's guaranteed [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1321.44s)]
*  in life. So that's the risk. So what I've been seeing on these deals is that you generally get [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1332.88s)]
*  funded to an initial inflection point and then you'll put warrants on it that'll be tied to a [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1340.24s)]
*  success event. So once you have the data, the warrant can be exercised and the data should [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1347.68s)]
*  drive appreciation, which will cause that. So what people are doing rather than writing a check for, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1353.92s)]
*  say, $60 million, and this is going to get you through all your clinical trials. They might write [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1360.48s)]
*  you a check for 20, that'll get you to a study. If that study is good, the warrant can exercise, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1365.6s)]
*  you can take it to the next level. So if you execute, your trials are funded. You don't execute, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1373.84s)]
*  you're going to have other problems as well. So that's the way that people are tranching it. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1381.6s)]
*  It makes intuitive sense, but it keeps people on a short leash. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1388.0s)]
*  Yeah. I want to get back to, we talked about some of the overarching global indicators like [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1392.56s)]
*  inflation and interest rates. What other indicators are you seeing that point either way? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1399.36s)]
*  We'll start with positive indicators. What indicators haven't we discussed that you [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1408.32s)]
*  think are pointing towards improvement? I guess I would build off of the things [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1414.0s)]
*  that we've discussed. The cut in interest rates is certainly good. I think the question is, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1420.64s)]
*  is that a head fake or not? So Jamie Dimon, for instance, when he was speaking at the conference, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1429.28s)]
*  he declared that he didn't believe in the soft landing. He saw too many inflationary [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1436.32s)]
*  issues out there that will keep the Fed rates higher for longer. And then there's other people [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1444.1599999999999s)]
*  saying, we're in an election year. They're going to cut the rates whether they need it or not, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1451.12s)]
*  which is certainly disappointing from an idealistic perspective of the Fed's independence. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1456.72s)]
*  But so I think the macro is going to be really important. Interest rates are going to have a [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1461.8400000000001s)]
*  profound impact. I think the M&A activities are important. And if the FTC continues to do what [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1467.76s)]
*  it does, it's going to be a Debbie downer. But I think that dynamic is helpful. I think there was [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1474.32s)]
*  an M&A deal recently that should give investors some encouragement to perhaps take a little bit [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1481.92s)]
*  more risk. And that's important about taking risk. And that really correlates to the interest rates, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1487.6s)]
*  the higher the rates, the less risk. So for instance, the Harcum transaction the other day [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1493.6799999999998s)]
*  that went off for $23 a share, the company was hurting only as recently as maybe three months ago, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1500.7199999999998s)]
*  and they did a recapitalization at about $5 a share. So those investors that invested at five, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1508.7199999999998s)]
*  they got a fourfold return in three months. So I think positive [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1515.44s)]
*  returns on transactions like that are going to cause people to take a more serious look [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1523.44s)]
*  at other opportunities. Because when you're throwing the baby out with the bath water, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1529.04s)]
*  there's opportunities to really create value relatively easily. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1536.32s)]
*  So really flow of funds, interest rates, M&A, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1540.32s)]
*  from my vantage point, those are really the most fundamental. That's what I'm looking at. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1547.68s)]
*  That's going to drive other investors back into the space. I think there is generally [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1552.48s)]
*  more sentiment that the biotech sector is kind of hit. People are calling it the low has been hit. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1560.08s)]
*  I still think it's a bit of a stock pickers club, but generally the sentiment is good, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1567.3600000000001s)]
*  and I hope it becomes more self-fulfilling as the year goes on. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1573.76s)]
*  Yeah. What do you, election cycle being sort of a wild card, you mentioned it's influence [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1577.52s)]
*  potentially negative. What else are you concerned about? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1585.68s)]
*  You know, drug pricing. I think the drug pricing discussions are going to just, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1589.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, it's the poster child for all the rhetoric. And I think that drives a lot of [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1594.8s)]
*  that the headwinds. You know, we shouldn't be public enemy number one. As we said earlier, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1600.3999999999999s)]
*  it's unfortunate for that for all the good that we do. But you know, we're easy targets. Even [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1607.04s)]
*  when you look at our financial statements, you know, the profitability of these companies are [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1615.28s)]
*  some of the most profitable in the world. So as long as those conditions prevail, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1619.6799999999998s)]
*  I think we remain an easy target. And I think we just kind of brace ourselves for that. You know, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1625.36s)]
*  it's noise. Most of this is just noise. So, you know, it'll argue for people who understand [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1631.04s)]
*  that it's more noise than anything. It's really political theater. You know, I think it actually [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1638.8s)]
*  represents a good opportunity because as the fundamentals are improving, it's actually [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1643.76s)]
*  represents a really good entry point. And I think people are starting to realize that there's an [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1648.96s)]
*  improvement in that. I guess a subtle metric that I would use to track the progress is, you know, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1652.48s)]
*  talking to investor relations firms. You know, one of the questions I've been asking people is the [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1659.2s)]
*  robust nature of their meetings. Are they getting a lot of meetings for their clients [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1665.68s)]
*  in terms of small caps, large caps? And I'd say it varies. You know, the small caps are not feeling [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1670.56s)]
*  as much love and that's going to make it harder. So, you know, I'd say valuation re-rating will be [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1678.48s)]
*  something to look at too, whether or not people recognize, you know, if a harpoon was trading at [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  five and it trades at 23, you know, what other arbitrage opportunities are there? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1690.16s)]
*  What about scientific and technical advances? Like it's been put a lot of conversations about [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1696.4s)]
*  all the great science and great programs that have been shelved for lack of resources as things [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1704.96s)]
*  come back. You know, does that like a revisiting of some of the new science and technology in [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1711.92s)]
*  the space, does that contribute to? Oh, totally. You know, that the different therapeutic areas [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1719.3600000000001s)]
*  and modalities are kind of like platform shoes. They go in and out of fashion. Today's fashion is [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1725.52s)]
*  kind of almost back to the future, you know, between Radio Farmer and ADCs, you know, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1731.76s)]
*  we've gone back to chemotherapy and radiation. Yeah. So in a new form, I would say with the recent [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1737.2s)]
*  acquisitions of Cerebell and Coruna, you know, CNS is an area that people are starting to really pay [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1745.12s)]
*  renewed focus. Certainly, BMS is certainly getting very aggressive there as a real focus area. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1752.0s)]
*  GLP, you know, that, you know, the whole obesity market has captivated the industry last year, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1758.8000000000002s)]
*  and they will continue to dominate a lot of noise. There's certainly a lot of people [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1766.4s)]
*  emulating that and they're looking at oral formulations. And there's different approaches, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1773.2s)]
*  you know, I almost cynically look at that whole hype and build that the old GLP trade is kind of [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1779.1200000000001s)]
*  almost like similar to trip buying or selling Tesla, you know, in a new market, you know, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1786.3999999999999s)]
*  there's going to be other electric car vehicles too. But I think in terms of GLP, I think what [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1792.6399999999999s)]
*  will be interesting too is because there's incredible side effects that people haven't taken into [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1799.52s)]
*  account. You know, when you lose that weight, you're also losing muscle mass. Yeah. And then [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1804.0s)]
*  generally when you rebound and you put the weight back, you're only putting back fat. And you lose [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1809.84s)]
*  bone density too, I understand. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I think that's still got to work its [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1815.04s)]
*  way through. I think there's better mousetraps to be had. I thought one anecdote that somebody put [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1821.2s)]
*  out there was he thinking it's going to become a vacation drug. People are going to take it a [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1827.68s)]
*  couple of months before they go away. A vanity drug, yeah. Absolutely. And, you know, question, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1831.52s)]
*  so I think some of the expectations may be a little bit long on that. I just don't think the [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1839.76s)]
*  durations and the penetration is going to necessarily last. But it'll be interesting to [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1847.1999999999998s)]
*  see how durable that is. I think a lot of buzz that people are looking at is AI. Everybody wants [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1853.04s)]
*  to talk to me about AI. Oh, everywhere. Everybody. Yeah. And it's funny, I was listening to a panel [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1859.04s)]
*  was out here. I said, you know, given everyone's talking about it, I better get smart on this quick. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1864.8s)]
*  And I thought one of the interesting observations I got on one of the panels that I listened to [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1869.84s)]
*  is that, you know, since so much of the data is in the public domain, one of the issues that we have [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1876.0s)]
*  that seems to be getting not glossed over, it's quietly not being addressed, is the fact that [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1881.36s)]
*  you think negative data is not so pervasive in the public domain. People don't generally publish [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1887.2s)]
*  the negative data as much. They publish their positive data. So, you know, so the algorithms [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1894.16s)]
*  and the data that we're basing a lot of these things on are arguably biased to being positive. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1899.0400000000002s)]
*  And we're not learning from the lessons from our failures, which is probably even more important. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1904.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. So, you know, the people on the panel acknowledge that that's a real issue. Yeah. And [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1910.72s)]
*  I don't know if there's necessarily a great solution yet. Figure out how you're going to [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1918.4s)]
*  get people to collaborate and share all of that and how inclusive is it is and is it [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1922.64s)]
*  representational. So that to me suggests that while we're making great advances, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1929.5200000000002s)]
*  there's still a few more things to sort out, but it's definitely going to be impactful. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1935.1200000000001s)]
*  And the other thing that I think came out of what I was hearing was that, you know, while [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1940.72s)]
*  it's the buzz, a lot of people have been doing a lot of machine learning and a lot of, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1944.96s)]
*  in terms of discovery efforts for over a decade. So, you know, it's not necessarily new. It's just, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1950.88s)]
*  again, you know, maybe it's 2.0 or 3.0 of what we're doing and we're getting better in terms of [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1956.08s)]
*  data management, but it really seems to be like data management. Once you have data management, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1962.8s)]
*  I think that will unlock. But right now, the emphasis on data. Are you hearing anything about [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1966.88s)]
*  the impact that AI and ML might have moving forward, like beyond discovery and design? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1972.8s)]
*  That's where like the use cases are right now. You know, accelerated discovery, aiding in [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1979.12s)]
*  molecular design. But when I think like in terms of a biotech moving, you get into [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1984.7199999999998s)]
*  translational and you start moving towards the clinic, that's when things start to get a little [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1993.28s)]
*  muddy. Like what AI and machine learning might contribute to what effectively is the most [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=1996.8s)]
*  daunting, you know, the do or die moment, right? The clinical trials. Are you hearing anything on [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2002.6399999999999s)]
*  that? You know, there's, I guess I haven't paid as much attention to it yet, but my instinct is, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2008.88s)]
*  is that it should be able to pay positively impact patient accruals, you know, access to, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2016.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, medical records. You should, if you're running an AML study, you know, you should be [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2021.3600000000001s)]
*  able to identify everybody who's AML. You know, you should be able to figure out better ways to [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2027.7600000000002s)]
*  recruit patients. I certainly think that, you know, in terms of some of the administrative aspects [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2032.88s)]
*  of clinical trials, it could probably improve efficiency, remove some of the human bottlenecks [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2041.44s)]
*  associated with it. I could see it, you know, as you're processing amendments and the protocols [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2047.2800000000002s)]
*  that can make things much more efficient. Again, I think you need the broader infrastructure to make [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2052.6400000000003s)]
*  that work, but I think it can have a profound impact all the way into the medical services side, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2061.28s)]
*  you know, doctors assistants, you know, I think that's, that's an area where you can probably [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2068.8s)]
*  free things up. You know, you just talk to R2D2 and get your script. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2073.76s)]
*  I think it's an important conversation. I was talking to a guy recently about AI and ML and [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2080.0s)]
*  he was positing that we don't, you know, we're not in a molecular drought. Like, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2085.52s)]
*  there's plenty to work with where AI and ML have had an impact. Now it's time to figure out how to [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2093.52s)]
*  address the real issues. So I think it's an important conversation to have and an [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2100.24s)]
*  important technology to watch. Oh, absolutely. And I think it can also really help in terms of [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2104.24s)]
*  helping us define what is the economic value of drugs, right? You know, that to me is the [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2111.2000000000003s)]
*  fundamental assessment is, you know, hospitalization costs, the cost of treating them, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2118.7200000000003s)]
*  re-treating them, periods of time of how long you can avoid being re-hospitalized. You know, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2124.88s)]
*  I think a lot of these real, we can really take advantage of some real world data and quantify [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2130.4s)]
*  to better understand what the value of the drugs are, how they should be priced and structured, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2135.84s)]
*  whether it should be risk sharing and how much money goes back into the system. You know, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2142.32s)]
*  right now people don't see this as system savings. They're saving money for their P&L or their P&L. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2147.28s)]
*  So there's not a holistic approach, but I think with better information, it can make, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2152.56s)]
*  steer more informed decisions and getting policymakers to get to the right places. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2157.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. What haven't I asked you that I should have? What haven't we hit on here? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2162.56s)]
*  Let me think. No, yeah, we can, I can stitch this back together. We've been bumping around, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2175.68s)]
*  so I don't want to beat any ponies that are already dead. Any questions? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2182.0s)]
*  We can probably talk about the conference, you know, as compared to other years. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2192.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And we can talk about the conference itself. You know, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2197.52s)]
*  there's a lot of people talking about it being moved. How many years have you attended this [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2201.04s)]
*  conference? I've been coming here for well over a decade and I made my first trip in 2023. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2208.96s)]
*  And then I came back about 10 years later. 2003. 2003. And then I came back about 10 years later, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2222.64s)]
*  and this is 12, 13 years. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and then there was that hiatus, right, during COVID. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2232.88s)]
*  I don't have a point of reference because last year was my first JPM. Last year was the first [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2242.4s)]
*  time I came. So I didn't have a point of reference, like what the conference looked like. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2248.64s)]
*  Prior to COVID or, you know, in the heydays, what's your assessment? Like if you take into [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2252.72s)]
*  account what you're seeing here today, this year? The conference has evolved. You know, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2259.04s)]
*  I like the kid that when I come to JP Morgan, I'm coming to hang out with 40,000 of my closest [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2266.08s)]
*  friends. Yeah. I'm not sure if we got to 40,000 this year. The headcount number seems to be [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2271.6s)]
*  a bit lighter. I thought last year we had a little bit of pent up demand given the hiatus [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2277.6s)]
*  we had due to COVID. I think people wanted to get out and about. And I did find it to be lighter [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2283.2s)]
*  than prior years, but it still felt like there was a little bit more intensity. This year, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2289.36s)]
*  it seemed to be less flow of people. I can tell you that when I was at the JP Morgan conference, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2295.52s)]
*  the St. Francis, other than when Jamie Diamond was talking, it was very easy to move around [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  in the building. That was the only time I thought fire would be a problem. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2308.64s)]
*  I would say talking to the folks who run the biotech showcase, they indicated that the numbers [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2314.56s)]
*  were a little bit lighter than prior years. But, you know, when I heard from JP Morgan that they [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2321.6s)]
*  cut their invitations down by about 20%, those guys were doing much better. I would say their [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2327.6s)]
*  numbers were almost flat, which suggests that there was still demand. People are still coming. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2333.12s)]
*  I would say that there is generally a distinction between the companies that present at the JP [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2341.68s)]
*  Morgan conference versus the biotech showcase. I think the biotech showcase does something that's [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2347.68s)]
*  really great. It provides access for companies to investors that would otherwise not have access [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2354.32s)]
*  to investors. It shows that you'd have to drill into it deeper. But I would say on a high level, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2359.92s)]
*  it sounds like there's a lot of companies that are trying to still engage with investors, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2369.92s)]
*  and that's outpacing maybe the headcount decline that we've seen here at the conference. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2373.52s)]
*  Yeah. It's like a cottage industry, right? There's a village of events, of receptions, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2377.9199999999996s)]
*  of meetings, of venues. Has that grown in your JPM tenure? Have you seen sort of that [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2385.68s)]
*  the outward growth and all these different events? Or has it been like that from the start? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2395.44s)]
*  No, I would say that it's definitely been that way for a long time. I would say that when I would say [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2402.4s)]
*  2020 conference was really the inflection point. It was just nuts, the number of different [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2413.52s)]
*  receptions, the number of different events, the number of different people. I found that I could [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2423.44s)]
*  walk down any street and I felt like my life would pass me by the different people that you run into. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2427.84s)]
*  At that point, they were charging me for everything. I expected someone to come up to [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2433.6800000000003s)]
*  me on the sidewalk to start charging me for standing there. I would say that this year, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2437.2000000000003s)]
*  there's been little less interaction like that, but if you stand in place near the St. Francis, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2444.0s)]
*  you're going to see a lot of people in a short period of time. I think that the service providers [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2449.36s)]
*  see this as a real opportunity for them to kind of try to build their book of business to be here. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2456.64s)]
*  I would say that what I like about JPMorgan is it's a great opportunity. It's a very efficient way [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2463.28s)]
*  to be able to reconnect with a lot of people in a very short period of time, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2473.84s)]
*  as well as also expand your circle of friends as well. So I've found it over the years to be a [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2478.8s)]
*  great place for doing business, whether it's your own personal business development, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2484.56s)]
*  whether or not you're looking to raise money and connect to investors, or you're trying to do [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2490.32s)]
*  strategic transactions. But because the nature of the interaction is so superficial, I mean, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2496.56s)]
*  it's really like speed dating. JPMorgan is really all about the follow-up and the success of your [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2502.32s)]
*  year, the success of your time here is really about the follow-up in terms of, it's great you've [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2509.2s)]
*  renewed relationships, but then you want to continue to build on them and stay relevant. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2514.08s)]
*  What the beauty is too, is that you can see somebody that you haven't seen in a half a decade, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2518.96s)]
*  and it's like yesterday. And I think it's a reminder that everybody that sometimes you think [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2523.7599999999998s)]
*  it's been too long, who's going to remember me, people remember, and I encourage everybody to [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2529.2s)]
*  reach out to people and stay in touch. It's a cold, harsh world that we live in, and being able to [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2534.4s)]
*  expand those circle of friends makes it a warmer place. Yeah. Do you see the significance of [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2540.72s)]
*  what goes on at the West and St. Francis, like the JPMorgan kind of nucleus? Do you see its [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2548.48s)]
*  significance, I don't want to say dwindling, but I've had many conversations with biotech execs [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2553.2799999999997s)]
*  this week who haven't set foot in the West and St. Francis, and maybe aren't even here for any [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2561.12s)]
*  of the other ancillary events. They're here for meetings that they've set up, they're doing things [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2567.76s)]
*  on the periphery. Does that significance kind of wane at all, or is there still a great, mighty way [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2572.8s)]
*  to sort of ground zero there? It's a fantastic question, and certainly you're going to get a [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2580.8s)]
*  lot of different perspectives on it. From my two cents, JPMorgan has become norm and cliche [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2588.8s)]
*  for the world's largest healthcare conference in San Francisco, but with that said, it's anchored [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2599.6800000000003s)]
*  by the JPMorgan conference, and there's been a lot of people talking about their disdain for the city [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2606.0800000000004s)]
*  San Francisco, and would love to bring it to a place where you weren't jammed, a poke in the eye [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2613.7599999999998s)]
*  for all the costs, where you didn't have to deal with a lot of the other social issues that are [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2619.8399999999997s)]
*  prevalent here. But I don't think that's going to work. I mean, I think it would be great, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2624.56s)]
*  if you brought this to say Orlando, or if you brought this to Las Vegas, but with that said, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2630.48s)]
*  I think you're actually going to be then marginalizing or commoditizing the JPMorgan [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2637.84s)]
*  conference if you did that, because you've got, I think having it in the St. Francis, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2643.6s)]
*  they control the narrative. There's been a lot of history there. This goes back to HQ back in the [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2649.44s)]
*  90s, and then people still refer to it as the... So there's a lot of history there, and I think [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2654.16s)]
*  for them to be able to continue to control the narrative as they do around the event, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2663.28s)]
*  Jamie Dimon's claiming that he's responsible for all the people that come to San Francisco, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2668.08s)]
*  I think they're going to keep it here, because I think it allows them to, like I said, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2674.32s)]
*  control the narrative of the event. It's their event, even if it is become nomenclature. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2678.4s)]
*  Well, good deal. Anything else you wanted to cover? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2684.1600000000003s)]
*  I guess the only thing I would add is that after having been in what seemed to be a war or a [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2687.12s)]
*  firefight or a storm for a couple of years, I think it's really, really encouraging to see that [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2696.4s)]
*  there's now positive, cautious optimism out there to look forward to. I don't think we're ready to [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2704.64s)]
*  bang the drums yet, but I am encouraged, but I think there's a lot of things that we, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2712.88s)]
*  as an industry, have to navigate, but I think it's back to fundamentals. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2717.44s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we don't want the drums to bang too hard, right? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2722.4s)]
*  I think they were banging too loud before. I think we got to learn from what happened, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2725.92s)]
*  but I think there's great... I mean, at the conference, I was looking at the next wave [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2730.1600000000003s)]
*  of companies in the private sector, and some of the science that's coming out of the world, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2734.6400000000003s)]
*  and some of the science that's around the corner is really, really, really interesting. It's really, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2740.8s)]
*  really, really responsive. And I think the other thing is the industry has pivoted a little bit. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2746.2400000000002s)]
*  There seems to be much more of an emphasis on an evolution more to chronic disease, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2753.36s)]
*  heart disease, and I think that's really, really important because when you've looked at all the [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2759.76s)]
*  ponderance of what's been approved over the last decade, it's very concentrated in [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2765.52s)]
*  often disease. It's very concentrated in oncology, and I've written things in the past that said that [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2770.0s)]
*  there was a lot of economic reasons for why that capital allocation was occurring, but it's nice [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2779.04s)]
*  to see, given the broad populations, that these large modalities or indications are now being [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2786.08s)]
*  addressed, and I think that that's going to really make a positive impact. But it also speaks to the [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2792.8s)]
*  fact that people are looking for bigger markets to invest in now. That seems to be the issue, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2797.92s)]
*  and I think that speaks to the former pipeline. And I say the risk on all of that when people [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2802.88s)]
*  are investing in later stage products or larger indications like that is the hard part now is how [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2810.2400000000002s)]
*  do you continue innovation? And right now, the emphasis on data is so important, and it's kind [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2818.64s)]
*  of a chicken and the egg. How do you start something without the data? And so one of the [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2825.6s)]
*  questions I have going into the year is how well will we proceed in the near term with [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2830.4s)]
*  funding innovation, given that we kind of head bow back so much as an industry? I think the good [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2837.04s)]
*  news is Goldman Sachs just opened up their first fund, I think a $600 million fund. There's been a [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2842.8s)]
*  number of other continued VC financings. I think OrbiMed opened up a couple of funds. So that's [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2848.8s)]
*  pwned well to innovation, but the innovation is going to be driven from the specialists. I think [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2855.6800000000003s)]
*  it's going to be hard for people who are trying to do it outside of the specialist funds, just given [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2861.76s)]
*  the way they're dynamics. And I would point to Peter Kaczynski wrote another piece talking about [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2866.6400000000003s)]
*  his view that the haves and have nots in any, if you look at the success of those funds, and [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2872.88s)]
*  it certainly caused some spirited discussion among folks. It was certainly provocative to [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2880.88s)]
*  say the least. Yeah. Real quick, we talked about a number of indications in markets. We talked about [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2885.84s)]
*  obesity. We talked about oncology. We talked about CNS. I'm curious, related to CNS, what your take [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2892.4s)]
*  is on the anti-aging space? You know, I think as we see the demographic shifting, it's certainly [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2901.2s)]
*  been an area of focus. I've always found it very hard to describe what is anti-aging. I mean, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2909.52s)]
*  it's very subjective. You can attribute a lot of products already in the market that could be [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2916.48s)]
*  arguably anti-aging. I think it's a great market opportunity because you go back to vanity, and I [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHK2maJZEk&t=2921.68s)]
