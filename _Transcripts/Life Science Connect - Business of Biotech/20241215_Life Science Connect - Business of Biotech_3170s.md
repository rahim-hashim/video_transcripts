Video Description: This past spring, Xaira Therapeutics launched with $1 billion in backing, a who's-who mashup of Silicon Valley and biopharma stars led by Marc Tessier-Lavigne in the C-suite, and a mission to develop AI-generated drugs. On this week's episode of the Business of Biotech, we're digging into the company's origin story and its place on the greater techbio landscape with one of the men bearing responsibility for Xaira's launch. Vik Bajaj is Managing Director at Foresite Capital Management (which led Xaira's funding) and Cofounder and CEO at Foresite Labs (which helped incubate it, along with ARCH Venture Partners). He takes us behind the scenes, and shares his worldview on the role of advanced computing technology in drug development.

# A $1B AI Bet With Foresite Labs' Vik Bajaj, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [December 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA)
*  There isn't much in the way of biotech that our guest on today's show has not done. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=0.0s)]
*  Since earning his PhD in physical chemistry at MIT, he's hopscotch across several intersections [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=9.8s)]
*  of the high-tech, life sciences, and financial industries from running point on network incident [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=16.0s)]
*  response at Penn and doing disaster relief work for the American Red Cross in the early [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=22.68s)]
*  years of his career to some great big startups like Google Life Sciences, where he was co-founder [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=27.44s)]
*  and CSO through its transition to Verily and Grail, to academic work at UC Berkeley and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=34.32s)]
*  Stanford to more recently joining Foresight Capital Management and launching Foresight [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=41.56s)]
*  Labs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=47.72s)]
*  He's amassed a collection of experiences that give him a unique perspective on the opportunities [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=49.32s)]
*  that present themselves when science, technology, and money converge. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=54.36s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=60.16s)]
*  This is the Business of Biotech. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=61.24s)]
*  On today's episode, we're digging into that convergence of tech, science, and money with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=62.72s)]
*  Dr. Vic Bajaj, a guy who's got a hand in a startup called Xera Therapeutics out of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=68.24s)]
*  Foresight Labs ecosystem that's got some serious backing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=75.12s)]
*  We're going to get to know Vic and his biotech worldview. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=80.16s)]
*  More specifically, we'll dig into the big bets he's placing on technologies like AI [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=83.12s)]
*  and ML, demonstrated by the mansion, the billion dollar mansion Xera is building in a burgeoning [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=87.68s)]
*  industry full of cottages. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  Vic, welcome to the show. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Oh, thank you, Matt. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=98.84s)]
*  Very nice to meet you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=100.28s)]
*  And I've been looking forward to this conversation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  As have I. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=105.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=106.28s)]
*  And just for the listener's reference, before we started recording here, Vic and I were [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=107.28s)]
*  bantering a little bit about political influence on biotech, which wasn't on the bingo card [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=109.56s)]
*  for today's discussion, but may make its way to our discussion after hearing some of your [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=115.12s)]
*  thoughts and opinions. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=120.72s)]
*  But where I want to start is in the here and now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=121.72s)]
*  As I said, I rattled off quite a list of experiences that you've had in the space from day one. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=124.92s)]
*  And currently, you've got broad responsibility across three distinct, I guess, operating [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=131.24s)]
*  units or divisions or facets of Forsyte. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  So I want to kind of get a lay of the land for the intersection of your work at Forsyte [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  Capital Management, Forsyte Labs, and Xera Therapeutics. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  Am I pronouncing that correctly, by the way, Xera? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=160.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=161.96s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=162.96s)]
*  I want to get a lay of the land of the intersection of those and sort of the chronology of your [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=163.96s)]
*  work in each of them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=167.48s)]
*  Well, let me start by talking a bit about Xera, because I think it gives some insight [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=169.88s)]
*  into how we do things. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=174.44s)]
*  So Xera is something that we launched jointly with my colleague and friend, Bob Nelson at [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  Arch, along with David Baker's group at the Institute for Protein Design. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  David Baker, as you know, was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work last month. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=193.4s)]
*  And our model as investors is a little bit more operational than you would expect from [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=201.08s)]
*  an investment firm. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=209.28s)]
*  So we have an incubator, Forsyte Labs, where we help to stand up and get these companies [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=210.28s)]
*  off the ground, bringing the pieces together, making sure that they're launched with the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=216.32s)]
*  right operating infrastructure, and contributing where we can some elements of scientific platforms [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=221.84s)]
*  and other things that we've spent years developing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=228.08s)]
*  But our model then is to essentially hire our replacements and make sure that we can [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=231.56s)]
*  move on quickly to the next thing while the company is in the hands of its permanent management, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=236.92s)]
*  in this case under a brilliant CEO, Marc Tessier-Levin, and a team that includes both some of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=243.92s)]
*  the most accomplished AI developers and practitioners and some of the most accomplished drug developers [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=252.72s)]
*  in the world. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=260.74s)]
*  So that is in very good hands. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=262.36s)]
*  Bob and I, as representatives of Arch and Forsyte, are on the board. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=266.16s)]
*  But the company is now run by the Stellar management team, and we try to help them where [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=272.12s)]
*  we can. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, I'd like to get some... [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  So let's go back to Forsyte Labs then, because I'd like to dig into some of the, I guess, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=285.88s)]
*  the main at Forsyte Labs that produces companies like Zara. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=290.76s)]
*  As I understand it, you correct me if I'm wrong, as I understand it, Forsyte's sort [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  of focus is on developing companies around these core technologies. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=303.2s)]
*  You mentioned technologies like AI and ML. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=307.28s)]
*  And I can make inferences looking at your LinkedIn profile. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=310.44s)]
*  As I said, Google Life Sciences, verily, like, yeah, this guy's coming at it with a bit of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  a tech bio bend or bias. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=320.24s)]
*  But tell us why rationalize that for us, because I tried to make a play on words in the intro [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  around building a mansion in an industry full of cottage, right? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=330.08s)]
*  A little play on the cottage industry thing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=333.64s)]
*  We see this cottage industry right now of small players, just a highly fractionalized [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=335.84s)]
*  industry of super small players that are not nearly as well funded as Zara, coming at molecular [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=340.74s)]
*  discovery and design from an AI angle. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=348.14s)]
*  You might even look at it and go, you know, nascent borderline saturated. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=352.34s)]
*  Are we looking at like, where's the value? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=356.84s)]
*  So I'm curious about your take on that and what differentiates the approach. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, besides dollars, what differentiates the approach that you guys are taking around [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=367.14s)]
*  building companies around this foundation of AI and ML? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=373.14s)]
*  Long winded question, I know. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=376.44s)]
*  No, but a good one. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=378.24s)]
*  First of all, we're broadly focused on things that actually accelerate product development. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=380.34s)]
*  I don't have to tell or remind your audience, but it's worth remembering that our industry [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=387.44s)]
*  is very peculiar. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=393.14s)]
*  We have a 10 year product development cycle that is characterized by late stage failures. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=394.44s)]
*  You know, it's not for the faint of heart. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=402.74s)]
*  And part of that is really governed by our resort to empiricism at essentially every [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  stage of the process. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=414.04s)]
*  And there have been exceptions to that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=417.54s)]
*  The transformation of oncology from an entirely empirical discipline where broadly cytotoxic [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=419.74s)]
*  therapies were tested in broad patient populations to a completely different practice of precision [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=426.6s)]
*  oncology, where we understand the molecular and genetic drivers of cancer. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=434.5s)]
*  We produce drugs that are precisely targeted to those drivers and we both test and eventually [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=439.4s)]
*  deploy them in patients whose tumors actually harbor those drivers. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=444.4s)]
*  That's an example of a transformation of the industry from something that is very empirical [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=449.7s)]
*  and artisanal to something that is not quite but increasingly engineering like in the sense [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=454.65999999999997s)]
*  that there are predictable modular elements and predictable outcomes when those modular [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=460.3s)]
*  elements are employed, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=465.4s)]
*  So what we're broadly interested in is how can you accelerate drug discovery, drug development [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=468.0s)]
*  and even healthcare delivery? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=473.3s)]
*  We can come back to that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=474.7s)]
*  That is the whole infrastructure that consumes 20% of US GDP and increasing with miraculous [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=476.5s)]
*  outcomes but still nowhere near good enough. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=484.0s)]
*  So breaking that down, part of it is the long process, sometimes decades long, of understanding [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=488.3s)]
*  disease biology, understanding what targets cause disease rather than just are associated [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  with disease. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=504.7s)]
*  Those are the best drug targets. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=505.7s)]
*  The second part of the process is actually making molecules of whatever kind that engage [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=507.8s)]
*  targets in ways that reverse their malfunctions or induce a function that counteracts the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=512.0s)]
*  disease process. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=519.9s)]
*  Then given that drug against a target that we believe to be real and causal in disease, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=522.5s)]
*  you have to test the drug in clinical trials and you want to do that in a patient population [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=529.0s)]
*  that's as small as possible so the trial is as fast as possible and where the success [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=534.7s)]
*  rate is high. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=540.1s)]
*  Then you'd like to deploy that in a healthcare system ideally that's tuned to the needs [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=542.1s)]
*  of the individual patient. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=547.6s)]
*  In oncology, we now have at least scientifically the ability to manage the entire patient journey. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=549.2s)]
*  We can measure who is at risk for cancer. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=555.8s)]
*  We can target, as we did at GRAIL, people at highest risk for screening that is increasingly [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=558.7s)]
*  sophisticated. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=566.4s)]
*  Once we find the cancer, we can measure other properties of the cancer to target therapies [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=567.7s)]
*  to it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=573.9000000000001s)]
*  We can watch those therapies succeed or not and then we can even watch for recurrence [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=574.9000000000001s)]
*  using increasingly sophisticated assays. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=580.2s)]
*  Again, turning to oncology, how can we accelerate that product development cycle and how can [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=582.7s)]
*  we do something similar for all disease? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=589.3000000000001s)]
*  That's the question we're asking. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=592.2s)]
*  In the ideal case, that would be precise, tailored to the needs of the individual and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=594.2s)]
*  it would also allow us to intervene in disease early, maybe ideally preventing it before [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=599.7s)]
*  the harm is done or at least preventing the most deleterious consequences. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=604.7s)]
*  In that framework, we are convinced, I'm convinced, have been for a long time that the methods [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=610.5s)]
*  of modern large-scale computation at first and now machine learning in the last five [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=618.2s)]
*  years or more are maturing to the point where they promise to do for our product development [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=623.1s)]
*  cycle what they've done in the technology industry, in the finance industry, and other [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  parts of industry that have been thoroughly transformed. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=637.5s)]
*  That's what we've been really engaged with and the question is to understand when are [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=641.0s)]
*  those tools mature? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=646.5s)]
*  When are the data sets even, when do they exist? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=648.5s)]
*  When are they mature enough that those tools can be built? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=652.5s)]
*  And then finally, how do you arrange that toolkit in a company that's actually capable [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=655.8s)]
*  of doing product development? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=661.2s)]
*  Otherwise you have to wait five, six, seven, eight years to understand if your toolkit [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=663.1s)]
*  is even working. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=666.5s)]
*  Those themes are ones that we exercised in detail at Zara because the idea was to create [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=669.5s)]
*  a vertically integrated biopharma company whose mission from the beginning is to use [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=675.5s)]
*  this new and emerging toolkit to accelerate product development. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=682.0s)]
*  And the pillars of Zara, the people in Zara, the funding structure reflects all of that. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=686.7s)]
*  We brought into Zara at inception efforts that, like David Baker's, that have a 10-year [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=693.8s)]
*  legacy of validation or the Illumina intramural programs in data generation using perturbative [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=699.34s)]
*  experiments, functional genomics that were also very advanced. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=709.14s)]
*  And we did that so that these tools and technologies, as much as they'll contribute to a future [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=714.74s)]
*  pipeline of machine learning models, they're mature and ready to contribute to product [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=718.7800000000001s)]
*  development today. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=723.38s)]
*  And so we also brought into Zara really seasoned product developers like Debbie Law from BMS [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=725.78s)]
*  who truly understand how to harness this infrastructure and turn it into drug programs that benefit [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  patients. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=740.22s)]
*  So that was the model and kind of set of themes that led to the model. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=741.22s)]
*  What's the stage of, I don't know, maturation that we're at in terms of people like her [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=748.54s)]
*  who understand the ecosystem, the tools, and have the capability to bring it all together? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=755.9399999999999s)]
*  And I ask that question because I get the sense when you put your ear to the ground [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=761.62s)]
*  and listen to groups of scientists and biotech in forums, for instance, you go on the biotech [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=766.6999999999999s)]
*  forum on Reddit, the subreddit, the biotech subreddit. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=778.2s)]
*  You ever do that? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=782.0400000000001s)]
*  No, I try to avoid that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=783.4000000000001s)]
*  But I'm guessing that you're about to tell me why I try to avoid it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  But yes, what? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=791.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, because I'm wondering where the where the gap is, right? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=792.12s)]
*  Like, you know, if you if you put your ear to the ground and like I said, pay attention [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=796.08s)]
*  to some ground level chatter around AI and machine learning and biotech. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=799.3000000000001s)]
*  There remains a lot of skepticism and and much of that is surprisingly, maybe not not [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=806.68s)]
*  surprisingly around a younger cohort, you know, who who maybe haven't been around the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=812.92s)]
*  block in industry as much gives me the sense that industry is driving much of this innovation [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=820.0s)]
*  as opposed to academia. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=824.92s)]
*  I'm wondering if academia is still kind of stovepiped and it's in its approach to professing, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=826.4s)]
*  teaching and preparing, you know, tech, tech, bio workers. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=832.52s)]
*  You tell me, like, what does that landscape look like? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=836.66s)]
*  What's the funnel look like for companies like Xera and other companies that foresight [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=839.02s)]
*  labs is going to is going to turn out there, rely on people who understand this, these [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=842.42s)]
*  intersections? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=847.3s)]
*  Well, there's a lot that to unpack in the in the question. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=848.3s)]
*  Yeah, I ask these long winded multi point questions. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=854.78s)]
*  No, but let's take it one at a one at a time. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=858.54s)]
*  One is you don't have the freedom to construct an organization from a hypothetical training [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=862.62s)]
*  pipeline that takes 20 years to create. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=869.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=872.38s)]
*  And one thing I learned at Google in the life sciences program there, which we should come [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=873.38s)]
*  back to because it's like an AT&T Bell Labs environment that I feel really laid the foundations [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=878.92s)]
*  for a lot of what you're seeing in the space now is how difficult it is to get different [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=884.16s)]
*  kinds of people to work together. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=890.66s)]
*  And why? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=892.84s)]
*  What are the problems you have to solve to do that? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=893.84s)]
*  So I remember at Google at one point after we had launched the first clinical study and [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=896.6s)]
*  there were a couple of hundred people on the team, a mixture of wet lab scientists, software [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=903.36s)]
*  engineers and other kinds of engineers and clinicians. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  I surveyed the team and I asked them this question. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=913.68s)]
*  When do you think the first result of this study will impact clinical care of patients? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=917.36s)]
*  And of course, the clinician said, well, this is an observational study. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=926.12s)]
*  You know, we'll learn something from here. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=930.76s)]
*  It's going to lead to discoveries. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  Those have to be tested. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=934.42s)]
*  That's a decade, two decade long cycle before there's any impact. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=935.92s)]
*  And scientists are more optimistic. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  They're thinking about biomarkers, molecular factors, things that could impact product [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=942.84s)]
*  development. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=946.96s)]
*  They thought, you know, maybe in five years we'd have some novel endpoints for a clinical [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=947.96s)]
*  trial or biomarkers from these observational studies. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=951.8000000000001s)]
*  Software engineers thought that this would happen in a matter of months, that we would [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=956.0600000000001s)]
*  derive insights from an observational clinical study that were going to be transformative [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=960.0s)]
*  in health care. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=964.44s)]
*  And you know, what that reflects are the different product development cycles of each of those [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=965.88s)]
*  disciplines. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=971.0s)]
*  Their culture, their instruction, their training. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=973.0s)]
*  We talk about bilingualism and all of these things. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=978.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=981.32s)]
*  That's important. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=982.32s)]
*  But most important is to understand that in biotech and health care, we literally have [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=983.32s)]
*  a decade long product development cycle. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=987.76s)]
*  And for software engineers, that cycle is measured in weeks and months. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=990.44s)]
*  So getting those people to work together requires bridging those worlds, understanding the best [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=994.56s)]
*  of each, not sacrificing scientific rigor, but also not changing the way that software [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1002.0400000000001s)]
*  engineers work. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1007.96s)]
*  In fact, importing that process much more into the practice of science. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1008.96s)]
*  So now the second question you asked was about the training environment or how people are [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1013.8000000000001s)]
*  trained. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1021.52s)]
*  That's changed a lot too, right? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1024.08s)]
*  When I was in grad school, in the quantitative disciplines, people had software engineering [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1026.4s)]
*  experience, but it wasn't really in the quantitative physical science disciplines. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1035.88s)]
*  But it wasn't really rigorous in an engineering sense, unless like, you know, a subset of [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1042.48s)]
*  us, you had worked outside of science in the software world and been exposed to that in [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1049.16s)]
*  some way, right? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1053.96s)]
*  That was normal. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1055.24s)]
*  Today that's not normal at all. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1056.8s)]
*  In people in biological AI, people in fields of statistics, biology, computer science [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1058.84s)]
*  that are touching machine learning. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1066.1200000000001s)]
*  Actually, this generation of scientists has a understanding of all of the tools that industry [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1068.04s)]
*  uses for software engineering and software development. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1075.28s)]
*  That the mission to release tools that other people can use, they understand the open source [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1078.64s)]
*  They understand to some extent and they're receptive to rigorous software engineering [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1083.4s)]
*  practice, release cycles, release calendars, requirements based development, testing based [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1089.4s)]
*  development. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1095.92s)]
*  So that's changed. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it's probably taken 15 years for that to change. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1098.1200000000001s)]
*  So I think the workforce that is coming in now today is way more informed in the disciplines [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1104.24s)]
*  that we need. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1110.0800000000002s)]
*  And that actually, to your third point, reflects the practice of science in academia. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1111.34s)]
*  You know, it's no accident this year that two Nobel prizes in two different disciplines [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1117.9399999999998s)]
*  went to AI and ML. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1123.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, when I came to Google a long time ago, he was giving an all hands meeting and [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1125.1799999999998s)]
*  I mentioned to all of the Google employees that, you know, the best scientists, they [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1130.58s)]
*  attracted to environments where they have new tools to accomplish their science because [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1138.42s)]
*  as scientists, it's not just what we find, but even the very questions we ask, the exploration [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1143.8999999999999s)]
*  you can conduct is circumscribed by the tools that you have available, at least as experimentalists [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1150.08s)]
*  to understand the world around you. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1155.34s)]
*  And it was clear then that the tools that Google had developed for completely different [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1158.42s)]
*  purposes were going to be the best scientific tools of my generation of scientists. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1162.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's why we all went there. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1167.0s)]
*  That's played itself out in academia. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1169.26s)]
*  So there is no part of academia today which doesn't use that toolkit to accomplish science. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1171.64s)]
*  And we could go into 20 examples of that. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1179.32s)]
*  But basically, academic science is aligned with the kind of themes that we were discussing [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1182.54s)]
*  before. The training environment reflects that. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1190.0s)]
*  So there's a robust pipeline of people who understand that that are coming into companies [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1194.3s)]
*  that we've started like Sarah. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1200.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1202.22s)]
*  I get the sense that in the time that you've spent since earning that physical chemistry [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1203.22s)]
*  degree, time spent at Google and elsewhere, you now lean decidedly into the software engineer [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1209.02s)]
*  mentality camp where, you know, five months ought to be a... [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1216.3s)]
*  Maybe five months is aggressive, but you get my point. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1220.26s)]
*  If you had to pick, where does Vic Bajaj live right now in terms of reality, product [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1226.64s)]
*  lifecycle development, product development timeframes versus where we want to be? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1232.08s)]
*  So this goes to, I think, something you mentioned before was implicit in your last question, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1239.12s)]
*  right? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1245.68s)]
*  When is any of this stuff actually going to accelerate product development? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1246.68s)]
*  Think about it now. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1251.5600000000002s)]
*  We have to hold ourselves to the utmost standard of evidence. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1253.72s)]
*  Let me give you an example of what we did at GRAIL, right? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1256.8400000000001s)]
*  GRAIL is running now one of the largest clinical trials ever attempted. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1261.44s)]
*  I think probably the largest outside of vaccine trials, right? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1267.68s)]
*  Why does the trial have to be that large? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1271.78s)]
*  Well, the goal of our product at GRAIL was to develop a blood test that's capable of [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1275.72s)]
*  screening for many, many different cancers. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1285.6s)]
*  That means that you need to show that you can detect all those cancers and also it would [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1290.1599999999999s)]
*  be unconscionable to tell the patient that, well, you have cancer somewhere in your body. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1295.04s)]
*  We don't know where it is. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1299.3799999999999s)]
*  Now you have to do some kind of workup to find it. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1300.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, that would be very unconscionable. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1303.36s)]
*  So it also has to be exquisitely precise about the site of origin. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1305.48s)]
*  Now if you want to do that for 20 different cancers, you are faced with two facts. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1309.72s)]
*  One is that every cancer is slightly different and you have to study all of them because [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1315.68s)]
*  you have to be able to tell them apart. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1320.22s)]
*  So it is not one disease, but dozens of diseases that are related but different. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1322.46s)]
*  So that immediately means that you need a much larger patient population because you [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1328.82s)]
*  have to have a representative number of all of these cancers. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1333.66s)]
*  Second, we want to see, to prove that the product works, healthy people get cancer that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1337.0600000000002s)]
*  the test can detect earlier. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1345.1000000000001s)]
*  Now cancer kills an enormous number of people. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1348.14s)]
*  It's a sad fact, but the reality is the chances of any healthy person getting cancer in a [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1352.14s)]
*  year are exceedingly low. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1357.8600000000001s)]
*  So that means now you have to enroll even more people because you have to have statistical [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1360.12s)]
*  power. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1367.1599999999999s)]
*  You have to anticipate that you will see this number of healthy people get cancer and 20 [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1368.6399999999999s)]
*  different cancers in a reasonable clinical trial timeframe, which in this case is three [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1374.76s)]
*  years. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1380.7199999999998s)]
*  So those things that I've all recited are scientific facts about statistics. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1382.04s)]
*  There's scientific facts about human biology that it's very unlikely that machine learning [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1387.8s)]
*  can impact or change. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1392.68s)]
*  And we can't pretend that this toolkit will absolve us of the responsibility to generate [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1395.32s)]
*  the most reliable evidence for interventions that are incredibly expensive economically. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1403.8s)]
*  We're always going to have to generate that evidence. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1410.24s)]
*  So one question that we're asking is how can you systematically accelerate the generation [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1412.6599999999999s)]
*  of medical evidence? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1416.86s)]
*  There's many ways to do that. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1418.4199999999998s)]
*  There's many ways that machine learning can be applied to do that. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1420.04s)]
*  There's also many ways that just business model innovation can be applied to do that [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1425.26s)]
*  as well. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1429.6599999999999s)]
*  And that's equally important. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1430.6599999999999s)]
*  But you can never shrink that. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1432.58s)]
*  I mean, never say never, but with no foreseeable data set, no foreseeable technology, could [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1435.2199999999998s)]
*  you shrink that to a five month process and be sure that it's safe and effective, which [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1441.4199999999998s)]
*  is ultimately the responsibility that we're held to. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1446.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1450.82s)]
*  That may be an interesting foray to touch on some of the discussion we were having before [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1452.94s)]
*  we hit the record button around political influence. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1457.26s)]
*  Because I'm curious, as you describe this, some of these, I guess, facets or factors [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1460.22s)]
*  that play into the development time when you're running a biotech business, I'm thinking about [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  the fact that we're at an inflection point, at least seemingly, we're at an inflection [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1473.22s)]
*  point looking at the next four years around the way that agencies like the FDA conduct [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1477.54s)]
*  business. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1483.02s)]
*  Like there's, based on some of the appointments we've seen in the last few days, there's [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1484.02s)]
*  a likelihood that at least there's going to be a strong influence for change. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1487.6200000000001s)]
*  Can one, do you see that as an opportunity? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1492.46s)]
*  Do you see that as an opportunity for HHS and FDA and CDC to kind of take a look around [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1494.74s)]
*  and say, what can we be doing differently to enable, at least work in lockstep with [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1503.18s)]
*  the efficiencies that we see coming out of industry? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1510.1000000000001s)]
*  So another two-part question. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1514.3400000000001s)]
*  One, do you see an opportunity there? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1515.6200000000001s)]
*  And two, do you think, do you have reason to hope or speculate that those agencies, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1518.0600000000002s)]
*  particular, and it's the role it plays in drug development, do you have reason to believe [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1529.7s)]
*  that they can enable some of these, embrace even some of these efficiencies? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1534.98s)]
*  Because this is revolutionary technology. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1540.9s)]
*  We see it play out over the next several years. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1542.9s)]
*  It could have very real implications on how fast you expect a company that you're investing [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1545.26s)]
*  in like Zara to go through the clinic. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1549.5s)]
*  So I mean, I'll try to lay out the positive potential and then maybe talk about some things [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1552.98s)]
*  that would impede that. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1557.78s)]
*  So one is that as much as we complain about the regulator at times, what the regulator [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1559.9s)]
*  does, especially in the United States, is largely focused on what it's supposed to focus [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1565.94s)]
*  on, safety and efficacy. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1571.94s)]
*  And the arguments that the regulator invokes are not unlike the arguments that I was reciting [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1575.7s)]
*  in relation to Grail's clinical trial size. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1584.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1587.0600000000002s)]
*  There's a quantum of evidence that's needed to prove a claim. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1588.0600000000002s)]
*  And that quantum of evidence is not totally independent of how you generate the evidence, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1592.02s)]
*  but you have to satisfy that. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1598.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1601.7s)]
*  And that's what the regulator does. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1602.7s)]
*  And for the most part, if you have innovations, take cancer biomarkers, basket trials in cancer, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1603.78s)]
*  we could recite a lot of examples. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1611.5s)]
*  There's a path to convince the regulator that what you're doing is reasonable, that it represents [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1614.46s)]
*  a well-defined patient population, that you are causing much more good than harm by doing [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1620.86s)]
*  whatever it is that you're doing that's innovative. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1626.66s)]
*  The regulator doesn't care if we use machine learning to automate the drudgery of preparing [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1630.7s)]
*  the materials that go into clinical trials. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1638.1399999999999s)]
*  In fact, those things reduce errors and there's a path to include them that's relatively straightforward. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1642.42s)]
*  If we have novel clinical trial endpoints, time and time again, there are paths to include [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1649.98s)]
*  them that are appropriately difficult, but they're not opaque. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1655.26s)]
*  They're not mystical. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1659.66s)]
*  That said, there's also areas where the regulator can improve, can accelerate. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1662.18s)]
*  And there we should take comfort that there's been bipartisan set of individuals who are [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1668.98s)]
*  committed to that principles, all of them. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1676.3000000000002s)]
*  I'll name two that I work with personally. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1679.26s)]
*  One is Rob Califf, who is dear friend and was a mentor to me when he was at Google. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1682.66s)]
*  He is extremely committed to the idea of accelerating the generation of clinical evidence [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1688.26s)]
*  without sacrificing rigor in every way possible. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1693.18s)]
*  There's probably no human on the planet who's run more large clinical trials than, I'm sure, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1697.3s)]
*  Califf has and Rob has, but he's very committed to innovation at every step of the process. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1703.7s)]
*  And the other one, Scott Gottlieb, different party. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1710.98s)]
*  He's someone who we work with at Zara. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1716.1s)]
*  He is equally committed to innovation, creating paths for these new tools and technologies [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1719.1799999999998s)]
*  to come forward, actually creating business incentives to work with the regulator in unique ways. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1725.22s)]
*  So I'm kind of comforted that there's this whole bipartisan infrastructure set of individuals [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1732.06s)]
*  that start with the basic scientific premise that we have to prove these things are safe. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1737.06s)]
*  We have to prove they're effective. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1742.82s)]
*  And then let's pull every lever. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1745.26s)]
*  Let's consider any innovative path to demonstrate those two things more and more quickly to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1747.94s)]
*  just accelerate how much we learn. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1753.3799999999999s)]
*  And as long as they start from that scientific premise, broadly speaking, I can't even really [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1756.78s)]
*  tell the difference overall between people from different parties who've held that role [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1763.98s)]
*  because they're all committed to the same things. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1772.3s)]
*  Now, what happens if that premise is challenged? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1775.06s)]
*  That is no longer science based. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1778.22s)]
*  There are some other principles that are being served, that are mixed up in the regulatory process. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1780.82s)]
*  That's what I worry about, because the outcome there is not something that I could predict. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1786.06s)]
*  And it's not clear that then people would be following the same incentives and rules. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1792.22s)]
*  And in that framework, it's not clear how the professional staff at the FDA would even [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1799.3000000000002s)]
*  react to different kinds of incentives and pressures. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1806.5800000000002s)]
*  So that I'm worried about because it's so unpredictable. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1810.0600000000002s)]
*  But what is predictable is if you start from that patient centered science based premise, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1813.18s)]
*  that people of radically different political persuasions all find ways consistent with [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1820.02s)]
*  their politics and their worldviews to make the process more efficient. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1825.86s)]
*  So many should have such a, I don't want to say rosy, but a bipartisan and tempered approach. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1832.9399999999998s)]
*  Well that's what we've had until, well, we don't know what we have today. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1841.9799999999998s)]
*  We don't know what we have for sure until today. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1847.2199999999998s)]
*  Don't know what we have, don't know what we're getting. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1850.1399999999999s)]
*  We'll know that tomorrow. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1852.34s)]
*  We'll know that the next day. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1854.1799999999998s)]
*  So getting back to foresight labs and foresight capital management, we've had this discussion [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1855.46s)]
*  around the importance of the sort of tech core of companies that you're interested in [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1862.06s)]
*  and funding and Zara. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1868.06s)]
*  What other criteria do you apply? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1871.06s)]
*  And you can answer this from either perspective as a capital management company or the foresight [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1874.38s)]
*  labs perspective. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1880.3400000000001s)]
*  What other criteria do you apply to the determination of companies, modalities, technologies that [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1882.1s)]
*  you're interested in investing in? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1889.4199999999998s)]
*  Is it modality specific? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1892.8999999999999s)]
*  Is it indication specific? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1893.8999999999999s)]
*  Are there geographic sort of guidelines? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1895.3799999999999s)]
*  Just give us some sense for the MO there in terms of your investment criteria. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1898.6999999999998s)]
*  So it depends on the kind of company and the criteria for company creation and investing [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1904.1s)]
*  in companies. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1908.58s)]
*  They overlap, but the emphasis is different. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1909.82s)]
*  So one thing I think that distinguishes our practice at foresight capital, and it's something [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1912.38s)]
*  that the founder of our firm and my colleague, Jim Tannenbaum, has emphasized from the beginning [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1918.1000000000001s)]
*  long before I was here, is measurable product quality. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1926.1000000000001s)]
*  And so for example, we have a very robust therapeutics team led by Michael Rome and Dorothy [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1931.38s)]
*  Margulski, and they are among the world's experts at evaluating the quality of a product [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1938.1s)]
*  as it's nearing a clinical experiment, predicting how will it work, seeing all of the dimensions [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1948.4199999999998s)]
*  from the molecular to the clinical to even the commercial, connecting those to understand [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1955.2199999999998s)]
*  is this a product which will fundamentally benefit patients and are there any barriers [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1961.2199999999998s)]
*  to its adoption. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1966.36s)]
*  So that product orientation, which is in the firm since its founding, infuses even some [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1968.32s)]
*  of the more long range speculative things that we create and we do, including big idea [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1978.56s)]
*  companies like Zara, because in the end, there's this foundation of accountability to the patient, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1985.48s)]
*  which is driven by knowing exactly what criteria you have to satisfy for a drug to be good. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=1992.8799999999999s)]
*  So we've never lost touch with that. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2000.52s)]
*  And that definitely animates everything that we do, even in the big ideas that you wouldn't [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2003.9199999999998s)]
*  think are grounded in that kind of product logic, but increasingly they are. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2012.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2017.08s)]
*  Regarding the point I made earlier about the cottage industry of companies that are coming, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2018.08s)]
*  biotech companies that are coming up with an AIML bend or AIML companies who are attempting [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2025.84s)]
*  to break into even as a service, right? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2033.48s)]
*  Like service providers who want to serve biotech companies that are doing molecular discovery, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2036.6399999999999s)]
*  target identification design. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2042.8s)]
*  How do you see that shaking out? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2044.76s)]
*  It's a big broad question and maybe it's early to say, but I asked this question fully aware [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2046.28s)]
*  of the juxtaposition of a billion dollar investment in a company like Zara, right? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2054.24s)]
*  You've got Zara, you've got the recursions of the world. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2061.72s)]
*  You've got these big giants right now, big players in the space, but then you've got [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2064.2s)]
*  this sea of small players who are trying to get a piece of the pie. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2068.92s)]
*  What do you see happening there? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2074.08s)]
*  So it's tough to say, but we could again discuss some general principles and make some guesses. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2075.84s)]
*  So one thing that Chris Gibson and of course now Najat Khan is there as well. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2082.44s)]
*  One thing that all of us agree on is the need for companies like this to generate data in [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2089.6800000000003s)]
*  their domains. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2095.88s)]
*  Daphne Koller would also agree with that, right? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2098.48s)]
*  These are almost founding principles behind those three companies that I would highlight [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2102.44s)]
*  as really principled in their approaches, Recursion, Incitro, and now Zara. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2107.04s)]
*  I know that sounds either silly or obvious depending on your perspective, but actually [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2116.0s)]
*  there is a misunderstanding about the amount of biological data available and the importance [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2122.64s)]
*  of such data in training models to answer questions that are actually relevant for product [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2129.16s)]
*  development. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2135.7999999999997s)]
*  And let's look at some examples. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2137.24s)]
*  You know, in the technology world, the reason that models of larger and larger scale can [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2138.24s)]
*  be trained is because there is a amount of data available that continues to grow. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2146.4s)]
*  It may be plateauing now, but it has continued to grow in the past. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2151.96s)]
*  And that's because as consumers using devices like this, whether we want to or not, we generate [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2155.6s)]
*  data which is then harnessed for the next generation of models. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2160.96s)]
*  Whether those are new model architectures or they're just larger models using existing [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2167.56s)]
*  architectures that are working, there's actually no emergent or discontinuous behavior there. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2171.7999999999997s)]
*  Their properties and their internal training metrics are essentially continuous properties [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2177.04s)]
*  of the amount of data and the size of the model. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2182.0s)]
*  In biology, we do not have data of that scale. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2186.2s)]
*  In the places that we do take the PDB, the Protein Data Bank, this is a database that [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2190.88s)]
*  has atomistic accuracy, right? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2197.08s)]
*  Which is really unusual. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2199.44s)]
*  And it's been curated by four or five generations of scientists literally since the mid 1950s. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2201.44s)]
*  So that's a very unusual data set in its accuracy, breadth, historical completeness. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2207.2799999999997s)]
*  There's very, very few data sets like that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2214.6s)]
*  So one of the reasons that we're just scratching the surface in biological machine learning [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2216.8399999999997s)]
*  and things like, on the other hand, solving the protein structure problem or creating [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2221.56s)]
*  approaches to design proteins, there's a gulf between those two, is the quality of data [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2229.2999999999997s)]
*  available. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2235.6s)]
*  So our thesis and many others is that you actually have to create those data. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2236.94s)]
*  The world is not creating them. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2240.86s)]
*  Pharma companies are not creating them, maybe with the exception of Aviv Vergev and her [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2242.44s)]
*  collaboration with Recursion. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2247.12s)]
*  Nobody's creating those data at a scale that's needed to train biological models that would [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2252.06s)]
*  actually answer useful questions. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2256.3s)]
*  So what's an example of a useful question, just to be really concrete about this? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2258.62s)]
*  So in human genetics, we use to establish causal relationships between targets of drugs [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2263.06s)]
*  and disease. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2270.34s)]
*  And we can do that because genetics are kind of like a randomized control trial or the [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2272.94s)]
*  closest thing that we have to that in that genetic variation is random between two individuals. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2277.18s)]
*  So you can look at many, many millions of people ideally, and you can see what these [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2283.16s)]
*  random experiments of nature are doing to their disease risk or to biomarkers in their [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2291.14s)]
*  body that are associated with disease. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2295.38s)]
*  And because that's kind of random, like a randomized control trials, it allows you to [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2297.74s)]
*  make statements about causation, causality rather than just association. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2301.82s)]
*  So it's incredibly powerful. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2306.54s)]
*  But evolution selects against deleterious things. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2309.1s)]
*  So it's also quite limited, even in the limit where we have now a couple million people's [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2314.9s)]
*  individual's data available, one form of genetics or the other, we're still highly data limited. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2321.46s)]
*  So one question is, how can we discover new targets without observing them in human beings? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2327.9s)]
*  And that requires that we ideally do a lot of experiments where we introduce perturbations, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2333.22s)]
*  and we model changes, pings into cells and to animals and to model systems and put them [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2340.54s)]
*  all together. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2345.18s)]
*  These are things that we can't observe in nature. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2346.18s)]
*  They're too rare. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2348.54s)]
*  And understand how does that relate to the human experience of disease? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2350.5s)]
*  So that's kind of a grand challenge of machine learning for which the data are so limited [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2355.18s)]
*  that it's only been possible to solve in narrow corner cases. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2360.74s)]
*  One of the things that Zara is doing is creating more data of that kind in a single quarter [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2364.62s)]
*  than the whole world has created so far. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2370.14s)]
*  And we think that experiments of that scale are necessary. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2373.2599999999998s)]
*  The world isn't going to produce the equivalent of the protein data bank on its own in the [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2377.66s)]
*  short term. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2382.1s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2383.62s)]
*  It means that these companies that have a SaaS type business models or business models [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2385.54s)]
*  where they're not generating data, but they're working on models, they have to stay ahead [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2390.02s)]
*  of all of the model generation activity in academia, which is very hard. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2395.0s)]
*  There's a lot of creativity there and they have to somehow access these data sets. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2399.74s)]
*  If the data sets come into existence, they come into the public domain or they'll be [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2405.22s)]
*  able to access it and they can stay ahead of the academic community, then perhaps they [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2408.7799999999997s)]
*  could generate a lot of value actually. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2414.14s)]
*  If they don't, then it will be companies like Zara who are trying to generate data and harness [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2417.18s)]
*  the value of actually developing products that succeed. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2423.54s)]
*  And my prediction is in the steady state, all kinds of companies will exist because [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2428.46s)]
*  there'll be a lot more public data. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2433.2200000000003s)]
*  There'll be many, many models and more people who are able to really generate specialized [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2435.38s)]
*  model architectures for particular problems. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2441.46s)]
*  And there'll be many companies like Zara, which are harnessing all of this infrastructure [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2444.42s)]
*  for product development. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2447.96s)]
*  In the short term, our bet is that the data generators are most likely to succeed because [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2450.02s)]
*  the data simply don't exist. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2454.5s)]
*  I'd point to even in the technology LLM space, there are companies that are worth many billions [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2456.94s)]
*  of dollars whose sole purpose is to organize the data that's freely available on the internet [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2462.7400000000002s)]
*  and make it available to those companies that are training large models. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2469.3s)]
*  So even there, it's not as easy as I was suggesting. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2473.28s)]
*  In biology, it's exceedingly hard. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2477.86s)]
*  In clinical medicine, it's even harder. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2480.4s)]
*  So that's why we think data generation is a prerequisite for all of this to be useful. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2483.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2488.22s)]
*  Give us a sense for the execution of data generation. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2489.22s)]
*  Give us an idea how that happens. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2496.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, there's generally two or three models. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2498.22s)]
*  So one is this PDB type model where there are individual investigators or large institutions [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2502.9399999999996s)]
*  that are generating data and they pool it in databases for the good of the public. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2510.7s)]
*  You've seen many projects like that in oncology, for example. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2515.9s)]
*  You've seen many, well, the Cancer Genome Atlas, the DepMap project, the CCLE before that all [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2520.14s)]
*  at the Broad. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2527.82s)]
*  In single cell biology, there's been similar projects to create a single cell Atlas. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2529.22s)]
*  That's a project that Aviv Rigaven, Sarah Teichman started and ran. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2535.86s)]
*  CZI has made major contributions to that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2540.58s)]
*  So that's one model where consortium of academics over a decade generate a lot of data or over [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2543.7400000000002s)]
*  many decades and they pool it. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2549.7200000000003s)]
*  So another model is the model of nation states producing large cohort data. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2552.6s)]
*  That's happened in the UK. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2564.94s)]
*  I'm on the board of Genomics England, for example, and the UK remains, believe it or [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2567.54s)]
*  not, the world's largest data generating entity. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2571.26s)]
*  Most of the useful biomolecular data that we use comes from the UK, not from the United [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2574.5s)]
*  States because there's a rich tradition of that. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2580.78s)]
*  Variants of that include companies like Regeneron or Amgen, which have sponsored very large [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2586.34s)]
*  projects to generate those data over which for a short time they may have exclusivity, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2591.74s)]
*  but eventually it ends up in the public domain. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2596.66s)]
*  And then there's a third and emerging category of companies that are generating their own [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2600.46s)]
*  data and meaningfully sized data sets. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2605.3799999999997s)]
*  That's happened in genetics, 23andMe, Ancestry, Decode Genetics, Kari Steffensen's effort [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2610.7s)]
*  in Iceland. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2617.58s)]
*  But there's very few examples of that. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2618.7s)]
*  And there's even fewer examples of companies that have generated large scale laboratory [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2620.46s)]
*  data to train machine learning models. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2624.94s)]
*  But there are a few, including Incitro, Recursion, and Genentech now, and Xera. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2628.1800000000003s)]
*  So that's generally three ways that data get generated. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2637.3s)]
*  I think the last one is going to be very important in the next five years. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2642.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2648.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2649.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2651.86s)]
*  We're going to run short on time, so I got a couple more for you. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2652.22s)]
*  Sure. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2656.46s)]
*  I want to get back to that billion. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2657.18s)]
*  Billion dollars is a lot of money, Vic. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2660.54s)]
*  It's a lot of money. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2663.18s)]
*  What's the plan for that? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2665.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, what is that funding? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2667.2999999999997s)]
*  How many more Xeras can Foresight Labs put out? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2670.86s)]
*  Well, there's two or three separate questions there. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2675.74s)]
*  One is, what is the right amount of money for an idea like this? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2682.3799999999997s)]
*  And the answer is that you need a quantum of money that actually allows you to test [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2686.4599999999996s)]
*  the hypothesis. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2691.1s)]
*  Of course, the hypothesis has to be compelling enough that a whole community of people will [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2692.2999999999997s)]
*  join with you in sharing the risk. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2697.3399999999997s)]
*  That's what we've achieved at Xera. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2700.7s)]
*  It's a very big idea. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2702.3799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of optionality. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2703.8999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of ways in which it could be successful, many more than there are ways [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2704.7799999999997s)]
*  in which it won't succeed. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2709.98s)]
*  So that's how you assemble something of that magnitude. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2711.58s)]
*  It's that the idea merits it. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2716.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, again, going back to Grail, another example with Bob Nelson, where I was the chief [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2718.8599999999997s)]
*  scientific officer, Bob was the founding investor. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2725.58s)]
*  You can't test that out. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2729.98s)]
*  Investor, you can't test that idea with a small amount of money. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2731.18s)]
*  If you were just sitting, drawing on a napkin, the idea of detecting cancers early, you would [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2735.5s)]
*  conclude within a short amount of time that you need a very gigantic clinical trial. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2742.46s)]
*  And that costs what it costs. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2747.66s)]
*  So some ideas, the impact on health care are so great that they're worth testing. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2749.58s)]
*  And then the goal is to generate optionality so that those very large scale experiments, where [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2756.14s)]
*  you need that amount of money, that they're not binary. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2762.54s)]
*  They don't succeed or fail, but rather there's optionality, there's early success, there's [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2765.1s)]
*  tactics to make sure that the risk is managed and mitigated. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2769.74s)]
*  But you cannot get around the amount of money it takes to accomplish transformational things. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2774.14s)]
*  And when you do, you actually introduce a risk which is greater than the sum of all of the [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2779.66s)]
*  scientific and execution and engineering risk combined. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2786.62s)]
*  And that's simply that you're not resilient to the natural failures in any discovery process. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2789.9s)]
*  Those are not failures. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2795.58s)]
*  Those are things that abort unproductive paths and allow you to focus on paths that can work. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2796.54s)]
*  If you run out of money before you learn all of that, the consequences are far worse. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2803.18s)]
*  So I think the argument for funding these big ideas in that way, it's an argument that [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2809.66s)]
*  Bob and others have always advanced for decades now is absolutely correct. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2817.42s)]
*  I didn't mean to be too speculative. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2827.5s)]
*  I spend so much time in the biotech world where a billion dollar acquisition of a 10-year-old, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2829.18s)]
*  well-developed phase two clinical product is big news. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2836.14s)]
*  So to come out of the gates with that kind of money, I'm just a little bit starstruck by it. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2839.66s)]
*  That's all. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2843.74s)]
*  No, I understand. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2844.7799999999997s)]
*  But the reality is that big ideas need that kind of support. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2847.5s)]
*  And our job is to make sure, first of all, that we're excellent stewards of that capital. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2852.06s)]
*  So it is not a proxy for making sharp and sometimes painful decisions. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2857.1s)]
*  And also that we preserve a lot of optionality. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2863.42s)]
*  So there's many paths to success. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2866.7s)]
*  And that's a hallmark of these big ideas. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2869.66s)]
*  And then you asked, are there more like that coming? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2871.34s)]
*  Yes, there are more like that coming. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2874.06s)]
*  One that we are really interested in now is understanding how our [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2876.46s)]
*  deep scientific understanding of disease can actually impact healthcare delivery. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2885.42s)]
*  The gulf between what we can accomplish in the laboratory, what we can understand about [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2890.94s)]
*  an individual and an individual's experience of disease and risk for disease and what's [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2895.82s)]
*  in clinical practice, that is growing and growing and growing every year. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2900.3s)]
*  And we'd like to understand the architecture of a healthcare system that can seize all we know [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2905.9s)]
*  about science and apply it to maximum benefit, where right now there are enormous barriers to [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2912.2200000000003s)]
*  accomplishing that, very few of them scientific. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2920.54s)]
*  So that's an example of things to come. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2923.5s)]
*  That's a tantalizing hint you dropped out there. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2928.22s)]
*  I'm trying to put pieces together, but I don't want to get ahead of myself. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2933.2599999999998s)]
*  I just had this conversation, the episode that we'll drop prior to this one, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2939.18s)]
*  the drop the listeners heard last week was a conversation with Alan Shaw, where we talk [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2942.7s)]
*  a lot about that inefficiency, the fact that the United States of America in particular, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2947.58s)]
*  I know you're looking at things on more of a global scale as well, but we've got a $4 trillion [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2952.14s)]
*  healthcare problem and we don't perform very well in terms of outcomes. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2959.2599999999998s)]
*  Am I picking up on the hint that perhaps this, what you just described might be an element of [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2963.2599999999998s)]
*  a solution to that challenge? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2969.74s)]
*  Yes, that's our hope that we'd understand how to harness all of this science [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2971.5s)]
*  and technology to produce a kind of radical personalization of the healthcare product [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2977.26s)]
*  to the needs of the individual. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2983.5800000000004s)]
*  And the science is there to do that. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2988.46s)]
*  Yeah. All right. We need to wrap things up here, Vic. I feel like I could talk with you all [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2992.2200000000003s)]
*  afternoon. I've got so many more questions for you, but let's just end on this. Can you offer [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=2997.9s)]
*  our listeners, many of whom are new biotech leaders, new biotech builders, early stage [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3004.62s)]
*  companies, your best advice on approaching the marriage of high tech and bio in their endeavors? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3013.8199999999997s)]
*  My best advice is to make sure that the marriage of those two worlds, particular manifestation of [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3023.66s)]
*  that, there's a way to measure whether or not a product development process is being accelerated [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3034.46s)]
*  or some unique insight is being generated. It's a way to measure that so that if you don't have [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3041.02s)]
*  that, if you don't have the crucible of product development, you don't have the ability to [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3047.02s)]
*  product development within a company, then it's not just that you don't know whether you're [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3052.86s)]
*  succeeding or not, but actually the questions that you begin to ask are not related to what's [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3058.1400000000003s)]
*  needed in the end. In the end, we want to produce better drugs that alleviate the suffering of [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3064.1400000000003s)]
*  disease and eventually cure disease. And a measure of that has to be built in [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3070.1400000000003s)]
*  at every stage of the process. If it's not, the process can be easily misdirected. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3076.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Sound advice. Vic, thank you for joining me. As I said, I mean, I feel like we just scratched [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3083.3399999999997s)]
*  the surface here. I think what we're going to have to do is invite you back and maybe do a multi-part [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3090.22s)]
*  series because I feel like you've got a lot to offer our community and I appreciate what you've [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBz7KWbL7eA&t=3096.06s)]
