Video Description: Dr. Tal Zaks is back, along with Advancing RNA's Anna Rose Welch, for part 2 of "Story Time With Tal." On this week's episode, we turn from his time navigating medical affairs as CMO at Moderna during the COVID 19 pandemic to learn about his latest venture, an mRNA startup called Exsilio Therapeutics. We cover the foundational aspects of the company's start, from the science it's developing, who's been recruited to the team, and how Exsilio charted its way to an $82 million Series A co-led by Novartis Venture Fund and Delos Capital, with participation from OrbiMed, Insight Partners, J.P. Morgan Life Sciences Private Capital, CRISPR Therapeutics, Innovation Endeavors, Invus, Arc Ventures, and Deep Insight.

# Biotech Story Time With Tal Zaks, M.D. (Part 2)
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [January 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0)
*  Welcome back to the Business of Biotech, where last week we left you dangling off of a cliff [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=0.0s)]
*  on the edge of your seat with a to-be continued conversation with current Exilio CEO and Orbitmed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=9.08s)]
*  partner and past Moderna CMO, Dr. Tal Zaks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=16.72s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=21.68s)]
*  And I'm Anna Rose Welch. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=22.68s)]
*  And when you last heard from us, we were testing Dr. Zaks on his philosophy that it's not unmet [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=24.36s)]
*  medical need, but instead curiosity that drives innovation in biotech and more specifically [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=30.88s)]
*  in the mRNA space. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=36.2s)]
*  And on that note, if you're tuning in today, but you haven't listened yet to last week's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=38.66s)]
*  episode, stop what you're doing right now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=43.28s)]
*  Listen to last week's episode. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=45.72s)]
*  Dive right into that one first. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=47.84s)]
*  Unless you find yourself confused even more so than you usually are trying to following [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=49.8s)]
*  along with one of my rambling interviews. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, Anna Rose, we definitely want to give them more context of you as well before they [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=59.76s)]
*  listen to this part too. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=66.72s)]
*  Just an interloper. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=69.32s)]
*  Creep on in here and there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  So let's jump right back into the interrogation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=73.2s)]
*  I was going to ask you, this is where we were going the last time we spoke. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=78.12s)]
*  I was going to ask you in this industry where we see so often that money and to some extent [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=80.56s)]
*  regulatory favor reward those who chase unmet needs and big bonus that those unmet needs [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=86.48s)]
*  are in big market opportunities. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  How do you go about convincing people instead, per your commentary the last time we spoke, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=98.32s)]
*  to fund and back curiosity? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=104.72s)]
*  Well, Matt and Anna Rose, first of all, thank you for having me back in the program. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=107.64s)]
*  It's wonderful to be with you again and I look forward to the conversation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=112.56s)]
*  I think the answer is you have to paint a path to value for people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=117.32s)]
*  We don't fund curiosity for the sake of curiosity. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  That's an academic pursuit and the basic sciences, that is something that we all contribute to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=128.28s)]
*  as citizens, that's a public health, the NIH is notable in the US for doing that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=134.46s)]
*  I think when it comes to a return on investment in sort of the commercial economics sphere [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=141.22s)]
*  in which I live, what you have to do is create a vision whereby you will, if that curiosity [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=147.18s)]
*  pans out, you ask yourself the what if question. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=156.62s)]
*  What can you do with it that's of value? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  Show the path that people can actually sign up to say, yeah, we can get it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=163.58s)]
*  We realize it's risky. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=169.34s)]
*  We realize you don't know anything, everything, but if you can do this, here's what it looks [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=170.34s)]
*  like at the end and the end game is of concrete value to patients out there in the world. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=176.4s)]
*  I think that's what garners the investment. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  You're fortunate, switching gears just for a second because you asked on regulatory. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=189.2s)]
*  The US is very unique and a very part of our regulatory system. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  Not many people realize this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  When you go to FDA and you say, hey, I think this works, they basically tell you, show [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=202.1s)]
*  me the data and I will do my own analysis. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=208.62s)]
*  When you go to outside the US, usually people don't have the same depth to do their own [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  analysis, so they ask me, okay, prove it, and then they ask you questions trying to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=218.28s)]
*  poke holes at it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=221.96s)]
*  But the FDA is unique in the depth of the competencies that they have. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=223.68s)]
*  I think all of us as consumers should be really proud of it, especially in the US. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  It's one of the reasons that most of the rest of the world looks to the US FDA for approvals [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  and as a basis for making judgment. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=240.68s)]
*  Going back to the curiosity angle, when somebody comes to me with an idea, back in the day [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=246.24s)]
*  when we were starting this with mRNA, the critical question was not will it work? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=253.16s)]
*  Can you make mRNA translate a protein to human body? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=259.56s)]
*  The critical question was, if it could work, what would you do with it that would be of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=262.08s)]
*  value? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  I think that's where a lot of our energy went in the early days and that's where a lot of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  investor sentiment came in back then. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=271.96s)]
*  Germany is famous for having raised successive rounds that were unprecedented at the time [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=274.64s)]
*  because of the potential value that we saw in it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=282.44s)]
*  Switching gears today, when we look at investments, we look at things that are cutting edge usually [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  and the question is always, okay, what is the medicine at the end of the rainbow and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  Is there a credible path to get there within the financing that you're trying to raise? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  The company I'm leading now, Exilio, started with an idea that is based in curiosity. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  It basically looks at one of these elements in our genome, these genes that can go from [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=309.58000000000004s)]
*  place to place in the genome. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Think of them as really early primordial viruses. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=316.56s)]
*  If our concept of a virus is a piece of genetic material that goes to infect somebody else, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  another genome, well, these primordial viruses or parts of viruses are sort of, we call them [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=326.16s)]
*  jumping genes at a certain stage. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=334.24s)]
*  They actually evolved to try to jump within our own DNA and because of that, they have [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  unique ability of where they can go and what they can do, but also evolution has constrained [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  their ability to jump. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  Otherwise our genomes would be junk and we wouldn't be here. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=347.36s)]
*  Again, for full disclosure, you are now speaking with somebody who believes in evolution. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=351.84s)]
*  When the company was started, the question was, well, if these indeed occur and if you [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=360.08s)]
*  map our genome, and we can do that now, have been doing it for several years, almost half [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=366.32s)]
*  of our genome is remnants of various kinds of these genes trying to jump about, then [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=371.28s)]
*  it's pretty clear that some of them still have that ability to jump a little bit, but [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=376.72s)]
*  evolution has constrained that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=381.44000000000005s)]
*  Otherwise they'd wipe us out. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=382.72s)]
*  So can we find one of those elements and now using modern tools of engineering, actually [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=383.92s)]
*  make them better and start to use them as a platform for fixing genes, for inserting [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=389.12s)]
*  a gene where somebody is born with an error where they don't have the gene for that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=394.72s)]
*  That's the frequent cause of rare genetic diseases. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  That was the idea. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=403.28s)]
*  I became excited because the team that came together actually was marrying two avenues [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  of research. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=414.24s)]
*  One of them is mRNA and lipid nanoparticle. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=414.96s)]
*  We spoke about that at length. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=417.76s)]
*  The other one was gene therapy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=419.44s)]
*  We already have some gene therapies approved and we've been using really cumbersome ways [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=425.6s)]
*  of getting these foreign genes or these fixing genes, if you will, into our genome using [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=430.8s)]
*  what are called viral vectors, so bits and bobs of viruses that are really hard to make [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=436.8s)]
*  and have a whole host of challenges associated with them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=442.8s)]
*  When you can do that, you can only do that once because the immune system then immediately [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  recognizes that you can never give that gene again. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=451.12s)]
*  So you got to get it right on the first shot. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=453.68s)]
*  The whole gene therapy industry has evolved to this mantra of a one-time dose, once and done. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, it turns out that once and done is actually a bug. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=462.96s)]
*  It's not a feature. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  We can't do it more than once even if we needed to. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=468.55999999999995s)]
*  What this team that formed Exilio actually came up with the notion that if we could get this [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=472.08s)]
*  to work, if we could leverage what's already in nature but improve upon it, we can then use [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=478.32s)]
*  mRNA and lipid nanoparticle technology to deliver it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=483.92s)]
*  And the beauty is that mRNA and LNP technology is not immunogenic. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=487.68s)]
*  You can give it with repeat dosing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=492.24s)]
*  And so now I don't have to be once and done. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  I can actually repeat dose and get to the exact gene level I need [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=497.68s)]
*  to get a therapeutic benefit and potentially even a cure. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=501.68s)]
*  That's what got me excited. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  And so this is early stage. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  The team is super curious. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=508.48s)]
*  They're engineering. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=510.0s)]
*  They've got these structures up using machine learning, AI, all the usual buzzwords. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=511.76s)]
*  But the critical piece is at the end of it, you can paint a path to actually curing somebody [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=517.36s)]
*  with their disease. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=523.6s)]
*  And that's where you get rewarded. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=524.4s)]
*  I think that's a really good point. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=527.28s)]
*  And that's something too that I've started to hear more of in the mRNA space in particular, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=528.56s)]
*  in a redosable space. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=533.04s)]
*  We're following in the footsteps of treatments that have been sort of alluring, I think, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=534.72s)]
*  in terms of that one and done notion commercially, partially because they are so expensive. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=540.8s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think that one of the value propositions that hasn't really [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=549.52s)]
*  been seized upon yet by the mRNA space is that ability to redose. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  And that can really, I think, open up the space to a whole host of advantages, both [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  especially with patients too that are probably more familiar with that level of treatment, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=564.88s)]
*  chronic treatments in the biologic space, for example. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=569.76s)]
*  It's a risk versus benefit profile that they're more familiar with per se than one and done. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  But I'm really curious too in terms of, as you're looking at all of this curiosity [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=579.92s)]
*  in the space and in the mRNA world, how the funding journey has been. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  Have you had to sort of reiterate this story of overcome that sort of allure of the one [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=592.48s)]
*  and done treatment in the gene therapy space as you're working in the mRNA world? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=599.28s)]
*  And what are you finding is being more rewarded in terms of curiosity in the mRNA space today? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=605.6s)]
*  Well, I think that there's been a fundamental shift in funders' and investors' willingness [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=614.16s)]
*  to entertain the conversation based on the success of Moderna, Pfizer, and BioNTech. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=624.0s)]
*  Because what that success has demonstrated is that it is doable to give a human being mRNA [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=630.0s)]
*  and an LNP and go make a protein that will have a therapeutic benefit. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=635.92s)]
*  And you can do it at scale and it is safe. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=639.28s)]
*  And so a lot of things that would have probably taken us a decade or two to get to, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=642.88s)]
*  were actually accelerated to the benefit of this technology by the utilization of these vaccines. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=650.0s)]
*  I think where you see the conversation today, many companies and many investors are looking [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  to invest in sort of next-gen, okay, what can we do with this technology? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=662.48s)]
*  And of course, the space that I'm in, and there are competing companies like CRISPR, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=668.96s)]
*  beam, et cetera, that are also trying similar approaches, trying to get away from traditional [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=674.8s)]
*  viral vectors for gene therapy, but actually leverage what the capabilities that have been [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=684.9599999999999s)]
*  demonstrated mRNA and LNP can do and bring them into the gene therapy world. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  It's going to take some time, but between that and the new technologies that are emerging, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=697.76s)]
*  I'm very optimistic that we will see new medicines come about that leverage [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=704.48s)]
*  sort of both streams coming together. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=710.88s)]
*  Just to say one last thing, I think it's long been recognized that actually [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=716.4s)]
*  progress is not really the Archimedes in the bathtub moment of aha, but it's more like [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=723.28s)]
*  people taking things that have matured to a certain point from different fields and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=730.16s)]
*  bringing them together. And that's where you get sort of true innovation. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=734.7199999999999s)]
*  One example for me that I'm super always happy to discuss and proud of is the journey of the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=739.92s)]
*  cancer vaccines. I started my career as a postdoc working on that eons ago. When I joined Moderna, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=746.24s)]
*  I sort of realized that between what we now understood about cancer and what the immune [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=753.76s)]
*  system recognizes, between our ability to do sequencing that we never had before of every [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=758.32s)]
*  person's tumor and our ability now to use mRNA technology to create a very particular type of [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=763.2s)]
*  vaccine that stimulates just the right part of the immune system to go after cancer, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=768.96s)]
*  we should be able to put together a personalized cancer vaccine. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=773.7600000000001s)]
*  And we did. We started it back towards the end of 2015 when I was at Moderna, and the results of a [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=778.1600000000001s)]
*  randomized control trial have recently shown that it looks like that personalized vaccine can [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=784.4s)]
*  actually prevent recurrence of melanoma almost half the time if given in the right setting. So [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=789.92s)]
*  it's these strands that all come together. For exilio, it is the understanding of sequencing [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=796.8s)]
*  evolutions, these jumping genes, and what you can do with modern protein engineering tools, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=802.24s)]
*  and then what you can bring from mRNA and lipid nanoparticle. And everybody talks [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=808.48s)]
*  about AI and machine learning as the next enabler, and we're starting to see how that's [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=814.16s)]
*  accelerating our ability to do discovery in almost every place you look as well. So it's these pulling [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=818.48s)]
*  on different strands where curiosity has given us new tools and how you put them together to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=826.48s)]
*  actually create new medicines. That's what's fundable. Have you found that from an education [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=832.9599999999999s)]
*  standpoint when you're talking to investors and working with the investor community that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=838.88s)]
*  there has been any sort of education that's been needed to sort of help ease that transition from [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=843.6s)]
*  we know what mRNA LNPs can do in a vaccination context to now here we are exploring [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=850.96s)]
*  therapeutic cancer vaccines. We're looking into protein replacement, gene editing [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=858.0s)]
*  with mRNA and LNPs predominantly. Have you found that narrative, that education, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=863.0400000000001s)]
*  that awareness is needed in certain areas more so than others or are people pretty up to speed? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=870.9599999999999s)]
*  I think there's been a dramatic shift in terms of people understanding of the basic technology. Now [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=880.48s)]
*  that being said, and investors by and large, especially the biotech ones who are in this [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=887.28s)]
*  space, they're a pretty savvy bunch. But education is, you can never do too much of it. And the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=892.08s)]
*  fascinating thing about it, for me at least, and it goes back to my route as a physician, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  the biggest challenge every physician has and the one that we most often fail at is our ability or [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=907.5200000000001s)]
*  the need we have to explain similar pathophysiology processes of what the disease is [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=916.24s)]
*  to different people in different language coming at us from a different viewpoint. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=923.6s)]
*  And everybody has the experiment of going to a physician and not understanding [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=927.6s)]
*  what is it that they are actually saying. And trust me, the physician understood what they were [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=931.92s)]
*  saying, but the problem is they didn't figure out how to relate it to the patient. And it's on us to [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=936.4s)]
*  learn how to explain things in different language. And it's true in pharma as well. You have people [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=941.12s)]
*  with different expertises, you have the engineering folks, the research folks, the clinical folks, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=949.84s)]
*  even the finance folks, and they all kind of have their own language. And the fascinating thing is, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=955.84s)]
*  it turns out it's actually inbred into our culture. When I was a medical student, I read a [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=962.32s)]
*  fascinating book. There's a Canadian philosopher called John Ralston Soule, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=969.44s)]
*  and he wrote a book called Voltaire's Bastard, and the subtitle is The Tyranny of [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=973.9200000000001s)]
*  Reason in Western Civilization. And basically he sort of claims that reason doesn't lead you [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=979.44s)]
*  necessarily to morally correct choices, which is fair. And one of the subplots there that caught [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=985.2s)]
*  my attention is this notion that ever since the Middle Ages, when we started to specialise, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=993.12s)]
*  every specialty started to sort of enshroud their knowledge in their own language. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=997.84s)]
*  And that was a barrier to other people because your power was your knowledge, and so you wouldn't [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1005.04s)]
*  share it except with the cognoscente of your trade. And so you started to speak in lingo that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1010.96s)]
*  nobody else could perceive. And boy, do we still have it. By the way, physicians are the absolute [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1016.48s)]
*  worst offenders to this. And I'll give you a simple example. A patient can come to the office [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1021.52s)]
*  and their platelet counts are low. I have no idea why, but because they're low, they will have a [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1027.36s)]
*  certain type of skin rash. And the patient sits there, and the next thing you do is you tell them, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1032.32s)]
*  well, sir, you've got idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Well, I just told them that you've got [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1037.52s)]
*  a low platelet skin rash for reasons that I don't know, except I said it in Latin. Idiopathic, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1045.76s)]
*  I don't know, purpura, skin rash, thrombocytopenia, your platelets are low. And so every profession [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1050.64s)]
*  sort of has that. And the fun for me has been to sort of try to decipher what the other guys [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1058.4s)]
*  actually mean when they use that, and that's within pharma. But when you're speaking about [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1064.0s)]
*  what it is you do, my PhD mentor, the late Shraga Segal, pulled me aside once and said, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1068.5600000000002s)]
*  Tom, if you can't explain what you're doing to somebody in kindergarten, you don't really [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  understand what it is you're doing. And so I think on all of us, it's incumbent, those of us who are [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1078.24s)]
*  fortunate enough to be doing the cool stuff that we are, we have to be able to translate that to [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1084.24s)]
*  everybody, to a language that everybody can understand. Otherwise, what we do will be [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1090.32s)]
*  for none. And that's frankly where you guys come in as well. And I'm so happy to be here, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1095.1200000000001s)]
*  because for me, it's an opportunity to share with you and with you with the rest of the public what's [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1101.92s)]
*  so cool about the stuff that we do. Yeah, it is cool. And we appreciate it too. And I'm realizing [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1107.6s)]
*  that you've throughout the course of the conversation, parts one and now that we're, you know, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1112.1599999999999s)]
*  20 minutes into part two, you've alluded to Axelio and the curiosity of the people there. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  And we haven't gotten to how Axelio came together. So I want to hear the origin story. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1123.76s)]
*  So it started with a really smart investor within Orgumid, Roy Amarillo, who was a principal in our [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1128.0s)]
*  office. And he thought that, you know, he was trained as a geneticist. And he realized that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1138.4s)]
*  there was an opportunity here to kind of pull these two strands together. And the strand that [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  says I can do something with mRNA lipid nanoparticle, and I can insert a whole gene doing [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1151.28s)]
*  gene therapy based on these primordial elements, if I can engineer them better. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1156.08s)]
*  And so he went and talked to some academics who were working in the space, and he managed to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  get a few to kind of talk to him and start to kick the idea back and forth. And then they hired [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1166.8799999999999s)]
*  a few people. Orgumid is a venture firm, backed him in this idea and gave them some initial seed [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1170.96s)]
*  funding to go hire some folks. And, you know, we initially hired somebody who does this [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1178.32s)]
*  bioinformatics thing where they go and look at genomes of various species. The interesting [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1183.6s)]
*  thing about these elements is that they evolve in different species, but because they're limited [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1188.0s)]
*  to a species and they don't jump between species, then they will look very different if they're in [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1192.7199999999998s)]
*  a fish or in a bird or in a mammal or in a human being. But if they exist in areas that are [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1198.0s)]
*  conserved in our genome, then you can actually take an element from a butterfly or from a fish, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1204.8799999999999s)]
*  and you can actually put them in our genome, and it's going to work because the landing pad [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1210.88s)]
*  of the sequences are actually the same. And so he started to put these folks together, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1216.64s)]
*  hired some very creative and talented team, started up a lab, and started to explore, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1222.3200000000002s)]
*  can I find these sequences? Can I improve upon them? And I was about 18 months into, or yeah, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  about 18 months after the company was formed, I was visiting the area and they said, you know, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1236.4s)]
*  you're a partner, why don't you come and hear the pitch? And I'm thinking to myself, oh, this is [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1242.0800000000002s)]
*  great, right? I can just go around, why don't I hear the pitch? And then we'll go out for lunch, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1247.3600000000001s)]
*  I'll make some new friends, I'll sate my curiosity, and that'd be the end of it. Because 99% of the [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1251.2800000000002s)]
*  pitches I hear, you know, most of the time I don't even get lunch, but at least I get my curiosity. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1255.8400000000001s)]
*  It's always the food that brings someone to the table. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1260.8000000000002s)]
*  Right. And so we sit down and they start to tell me about this story. And I'm like, you know, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1263.2s)]
*  this evolution angle really spoke to me. And I'll tell you why in a minute. And it goes back again [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1268.08s)]
*  to Moderna. But I'm thinking to myself, this is really a neat idea, because you're taking [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1273.52s)]
*  something that you find in evolution, you figure out what is it that you can tweak about it to [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  actually make it better and get it to a level of potency that you can now use it as a therapeutic. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1282.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay, tell me more. And then they keep going. And an hour turns into two, at a certain point, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1289.1200000000001s)]
*  part I said, you know, forget lunch, we're not going to get to the restaurant. Let's just keep [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1293.68s)]
*  talking. They get the scientific founder on the phone. And by hour three, I was hooked because [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1297.1200000000001s)]
*  I realized they've actually reduced it to practice. They had some initial data to show that they can [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1301.68s)]
*  indeed do this. They can find such an element. They can improve it to the point that I could see [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1305.92s)]
*  a path to a medicine. And they tell me, don't worry, just give me funding for another year, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1310.24s)]
*  and I'll keep improving it. And I'm thinking to myself, yeah, you can, you know, you can go keep [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1315.44s)]
*  improving it. But can we please make a medicine out of this? This is this is good enough. Let's [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1320.56s)]
*  get started down the road and making medicines. And so they looked at me and said, Yeah, okay. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1324.8s)]
*  What do we do? These are, you know, a bunch of early research guys. And, and so I basically [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1330.16s)]
*  joined and took it upon myself to raise more money and start to build the what we call [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1336.72s)]
*  developments to take the research and translate it into what could be development candidates [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1341.84s)]
*  so that we can see a path to making medicines. And we're, we're, we're now well into that journey. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1347.92s)]
*  We're, we're, we still need to hire, still need to build a team, still need to find a CEO that's [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1355.2s)]
*  better than me. We'll get there. But in the meantime, the companies continue to make progress. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1359.28s)]
*  Like they said, when I joined them, they indeed have continued to improve on that potency. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1364.0s)]
*  While in the meantime, we've hired a couple people who can start to do the experiments [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1369.2s)]
*  and animals to start to show what this thing can actually look like. Yeah. Take me through [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1374.0800000000002s)]
*  the thought process that at that point, like you know, you've come off an incredible experience [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1379.6000000000001s)]
*  at Moderna, you know, you're, you're, you're doing, you have this, you have this really unique perch [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1384.24s)]
*  at Orbomed where you've got the lay of the land and access to all sorts of companies, MRNA and [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1389.92s)]
*  otherwise, right? You would more than likely be anointed the leader of any MRNA company that chose [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1396.32s)]
*  to have you, given your experience. And yet you choose, maybe you answer the question and sort of [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1404.8799999999999s)]
*  your, you know, your, your, your description of how things came together and you're intrigued by [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1413.28s)]
*  the curiosity. But why, like take, take me through the thought process, like why join this company [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1417.9199999999998s)]
*  and choose to lead it that is starting so early stage, you know, so when you could probably step [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1424.0s)]
*  into a super cushy position with a company that's far closer to, you know, commercial viability and [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1430.24s)]
*  perhaps putting a product on the market, just take me, I'm just curious to get inside your brain, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1435.6s)]
*  like when you're making this decision. Yeah. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1440.4s)]
*  Casey just made some amazing. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1447.36s)]
*  I'm trying to think. Look, I have an answer to that, but whatever that answer is, I can tell you, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1449.28s)]
*  my wife was not convinced. So I'll give it another shot. You know, I'm super proud and, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1456.56s)]
*  and feel fortunate to have joined Orbomed and that they accepted me as, as an investing partner. For [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1465.6s)]
*  me, you know, at this stage in life to kind of learn by doing, you know, with full immersion [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1470.6399999999999s)]
*  in a place and a team that has this phenomenal track record of success, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1476.8s)]
*  success of successful investment in life sciences companies. I take it as a privilege and [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1481.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm not that long into the tenure here. And I don't know, I don't think any leadership of any [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1489.44s)]
*  company is a cushy position, no matter what stage the company, I think being an operator is always [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1496.8s)]
*  challenging and, and especially being a CEO. I, this wasn't, if you will, a choice that I did [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1501.68s)]
*  because I thought, aha, the next thing in my career, I need to go tick that box. You know, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1511.76s)]
*  as I alluded to in our previous conversation, I'm sort of done with a box taking part of my life. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1517.8400000000001s)]
*  And now it's about, okay, where can I add value by virtue of what I know? I think what happened, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1522.0800000000002s)]
*  honestly, is that I just saw an opportunity to translate what I thought was a fascinating bit [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1527.76s)]
*  in science and to push it along outside of the research slash curiosity domain into the, let's [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1535.2s)]
*  put it on a path to making medicines domain, the path that is fundable, the path that, the path that [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1542.96s)]
*  should align with a return on investment. And I felt that I was sort of uniquely qualified given [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1548.4s)]
*  my experiences to go help this company in that next leg of its journey. And, you know, with that [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1557.44s)]
*  experience and the privilege of having done what I've done and the luck to have been able to do [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1566.24s)]
*  what I've done, I feel comes a certain responsibility to actually make good on that. So if you see [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1571.92s)]
*  something like this and you think, okay, you think you believe you've got some experiences that are [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1579.2s)]
*  relevant, uniquely relevant here, and you can help this group of folks in this bit of science to go [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1585.52s)]
*  on the next leg of journey towards making medicine. Well, that also carries an obligation to do that. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1591.28s)]
*  And I sort of felt compelled, again, my goal, neither for the short run nor the long run, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1598.16s)]
*  frankly, is necessarily to be the CEO of this company. But this company right now in this bit [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1606.0s)]
*  of science has the potential to translate into medicine. And, you know, I'm in a position, I think, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1611.52s)]
*  to contribute to support doing that. So I'm obligated. Yeah. Speaking of your contributions [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1617.84s)]
*  to that. And you told us a story on part one of Storytime with Hal about you told us a story. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1623.68s)]
*  Hal's tall tales. Yeah, that was it. That was the one. You told us a story about the balance between [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1631.12s)]
*  IP protection and getting published to attract capital. And the story was the one where you told [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1637.36s)]
*  us about the journal Nature Review juxtaposing Moderna at the time with Theranos, you know, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1641.84s)]
*  using the two in the same sentence. And so that story being on the record, I want to push you a [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1649.6s)]
*  little bit more on that story and maybe extract what that experience because here Exelio is in [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1655.6799999999998s)]
*  a position where there is no, you know, stated pipeline, but there is IP. So coming off of that [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1661.68s)]
*  experience, and I'm sure other experiences like it, how is it informing what you're doing now in [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1667.52s)]
*  terms of your management of an early stage company that has IP but doesn't doesn't have a, you know, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1673.2s)]
*  quote unquote, you know, publishable pipeline? Well, I think that, you know, to go back to, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1679.68s)]
*  if you will, that story, and I don't know if we shared it with the public, but it goes back to the [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1689.6s)]
*  to the importance of aligning doing good in the world, being ethical, and getting a return on [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1696.9599999999998s)]
*  investment. And so for me, where thou must publish is when you're in clinical trials. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1703.36s)]
*  And even though technically in phase one and healthy volunteers, you don't need to, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1712.6399999999999s)]
*  my personal philosophy is you have to publish everything you do in mankind full stock, you have [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1718.72s)]
*  to publish it in peer review journals. And if you agree with that logic, then actually it also means [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1724.4s)]
*  you have to publish the preclinical basis for any clinical experiment. So if I want to treat another [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1731.92s)]
*  human being with a medicine, then the science behind that, why that is credible, needs to be [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1737.44s)]
*  published in a peer review journal. That's my personal belief. It's not written, I don't think, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1743.92s)]
*  in any regulation. And you can get regulatory approval without publishing your papers, but I [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1748.8000000000002s)]
*  think it's incumbent upon you to have that sort of public scrutiny on what it is you're doing. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1754.88s)]
*  Earlier than that, though, you have to contend with the competitive nature of our business and [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1760.24s)]
*  wanting to actually give your investors a return on their investment, which means if you're ahead [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1768.96s)]
*  of the competition, then you can't enable them. And so you publish really when you need to [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1776.32s)]
*  be credible. And the question is, well, okay, why do you need to be credible? And you need to be [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1786.32s)]
*  credible because you want to attract talent, you want to attract capital. Well, if you can [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1790.8s)]
*  do that in a confidential manner, which as a private company you can, you can attract [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1796.3200000000002s)]
*  capital as a private company, then you don't necessarily need to publish. And you can hire [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1801.8400000000001s)]
*  people if you have them sign CDAs and you show them data in confidence, that's common. And so [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1807.04s)]
*  you don't actually need that public sort of imprint that what you do actually holds up. Now, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1814.0800000000002s)]
*  that being said, it does mean that investors and potential employees who need to join you [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1821.3600000000001s)]
*  need to do their due diligence. They can't rely on proxies in the public domain to say, yeah, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1828.08s)]
*  some two peers who shall remain anonymous have vetted this, even though we know often that [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1834.24s)]
*  doesn't necessarily replicate. But I think this ecosystem is stringent enough and the good [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1839.52s)]
*  venture capital firms, the ones that are known have a reputation and they're also careful to vet [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1848.08s)]
*  their investments and not put their money behind things that are nonsense. And so I think where [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1852.56s)]
*  Exilio is today, there is no immediate need to publish and probably a hindrance to publish. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1858.4s)]
*  Where Exilio will be hopefully tomorrow, we will start to have a need to publish to justify the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1866.4s)]
*  clinical experiment that we're about to undertake. And at that point, we absolutely will. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1873.36s)]
*  Tomorrow, we're going to take that literally, right? Tomorrow. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1878.56s)]
*  Tomorrow. They're poised, guys. This is getting serious. That actually ties really beautifully [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1881.84s)]
*  into my question. So you had mentioned that from a career trajectory standpoint, at some point, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1888.0s)]
*  you hope that there will be someone else to sort of take over the leadership of Exilio. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1892.56s)]
*  But in the meantime, as you are about to embark into the clinic tomorrow, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1898.48s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of challenges, I'm sure, ahead of you. Where are you looking that you think [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1904.08s)]
*  you're going to be spending most of your time in the next year, right? In terms of leading this [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1910.56s)]
*  company, what are you expecting to be challenged by the most? And keeping in mind, too, that this is a [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1915.84s)]
*  nascent scientific space as we're moving mRNA into the therapeutic world. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1923.84s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me correct two assumptions just for clarity, since we're on the record here. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1928.4s)]
*  It's not going to be tomorrow that we're in the clinic. And I have, while I hope to find somebody [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1936.0800000000002s)]
*  better than me as a CEO, this is an open-ended commitment on my side. I'll be here as long as [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1942.5600000000002s)]
*  it takes to get the best out of this platform. The challenges, you know, I think they're sort of [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1947.2800000000002s)]
*  in three buckets. The first is, as any young company, our science is nascent and we need to [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1958.4s)]
*  continue the balance between exploring our curiosity and doing the stuff that will get us [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1966.08s)]
*  the actual product, if you will. Because any time you hit sort of a roadblock when something doesn't [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1973.44s)]
*  work as expected, and every young company has those, then it takes a bunch of curious, smart [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1980.8799999999999s)]
*  people to start to poke around the edges and figure out, well, how do we get around this? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1986.16s)]
*  Right? And so there's always that balance, and getting that balance right is always challenging. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1989.28s)]
*  If this were to follow a logical step of progression, oh, to solve that, you do this, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=1995.6000000000001s)]
*  it wouldn't be what it is. You know, it actually, it takes me back. My late father was a mathematician, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2003.44s)]
*  and I never fully understood everything he did, but I understood enough to know that for every, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2014.08s)]
*  you know, the greatest mathematicians are known not necessarily by the answers they gave, but by [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2022.0s)]
*  the questions they posed. And so they were able to pose a question, how do you prove this? I think [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2028.48s)]
*  this is right. Can anybody prove it? And, you know, the better the mathematician, the longer it took [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2034.16s)]
*  for somebody to actually answer that question. And if you think about it, even in mathematics, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2040.48s)]
*  which is the epitome of logical thinking, proving something new, writing a new paper, actually takes [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2046.24s)]
*  some sort of associative thinking that comes out of left field, because if it were just a logical [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2053.84s)]
*  progression, it wouldn't be tough to do. I think the corollary in our space, and I'm taking you back [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2058.64s)]
*  to the challenges that we face, it is making sure that we get the balance right within the company [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2065.6s)]
*  as we navigate our way forward from this nascent science and technology into actual products that [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2071.36s)]
*  we think can work for people. There's a lot of work for us ahead on that. The second challenge is [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2076.32s)]
*  finding the right people. This is a team sport, and every time I'm in a meeting, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2083.36s)]
*  if I'm the one giving the answer to the question, I know that I've got a problem. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2092.56s)]
*  We're not in a good place if I'm the one giving the question. Now, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2101.8399999999997s)]
*  given the answers, the answers may be okay. Most of the time, they won't be. The problem is I won't [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2104.56s)]
*  know if they are or not, right? So building up the team with the right level of experience [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2108.96s)]
*  and the right competencies to take this company forward is absolutely my number one challenge [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2114.8s)]
*  these days as we continue to grow the team and make progress. The final one, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2122.48s)]
*  which goes back to the investment thesis, balancing the books in the sense that balancing [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2129.2000000000003s)]
*  the spend on a monthly basis versus what you have in the bank versus what is actually creating value [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2138.7999999999997s)]
*  that you can show investors your one step further down the path. No, I'm still not in that clinical [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2146.24s)]
*  experiment that I promised on a rose I'll be tomorrow, but I'm one step closer to it. Therefore, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2152.0s)]
*  the value has increased. Therefore, it's time for another funding round. How do you manage that [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2158.08s)]
*  with the actual burn? If you will, your financing strategy is absolutely critical for success. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2164.16s)]
*  And that's part of the equation here. Yeah. Well, to the extent that you can, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2171.44s)]
*  I hate saying unpack. Let's unpack that. That's a common word. Yeah, that's cliche. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2177.84s)]
*  I find myself using it all the time. But I'm going to say it. Let's unpack that a little bit. How do [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2183.68s)]
*  you think about return on investment? It's an interesting perspective that you have because [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2187.04s)]
*  as an investor, you know, in your roles at OrbamentMed, you're the man, you know, holding [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2192.24s)]
*  expectations. And as the CEO at Exilio, you're the man managing expectations. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2197.2799999999997s)]
*  Walk us, you know, take us down that tightrope. Do you get into fights with yourself? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2204.72s)]
*  Well, the biggest arguments are always between the right side in the brain, the left side of the [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2212.56s)]
*  brain. If only they would talk to each other more, they'd figure it all out. Right. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2215.92s)]
*  I think that to answer it seriously, the world of biotech investing has changed in the last few [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2222.64s)]
*  years with the macroeconomic changes that we face. Realize that people who invest in us [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2232.2400000000002s)]
*  can invest anywhere. They don't need to invest with us. So we're competing for those [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2240.88s)]
*  investment dollars with tech, with biotech, with other investment opportunities at some [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2245.6s)]
*  level with treasuries. When interest rates go up, then a long-term investment suddenly becomes less [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2255.52s)]
*  palatable. When you live in a zero interest rate world, then somebody's got a hundred bucks and [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2262.56s)]
*  they need to figure out what to do with it. Well, if nobody gives them any interest on it, then they [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2269.28s)]
*  can sit on a hundred bucks and in 10 years that hundred bucks will be a hundred bucks. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2273.76s)]
*  If they come to me and I say, look, I'm going to make you three times that money, but it's going [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2277.76s)]
*  to take me 10 years, then they say, great, because now I can make a hundred into 300. It's okay, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2281.84s)]
*  because time doesn't cost me. But if we're in a world of a 5% interest rates, then in 10 years, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2287.44s)]
*  that hundred bucks is already 200 if I do nothing else with it but buy treasuries. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2293.36s)]
*  Our hurdle rate, what we call the level that we need to justify as a return on the investment, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2298.2400000000002s)]
*  has suddenly become challenging and that's had an effect on a lot of very early stage [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2305.04s)]
*  platform biotechs. Managing the time to value creation is critical while managing how much [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2309.92s)]
*  investment you absolutely need and don't get more money than you absolutely need to get to the next [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2319.76s)]
*  step. And that's a little bit different than what it used to be. It used to be that, well, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2326.08s)]
*  as soon as you can get money, go get money, right? Now you're going to have to justify a higher [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2330.16s)]
*  valuation for getting more money and that's becoming more and more challenging. And so you've [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2336.24s)]
*  seen the effects kind of in the ecosystem and I think one of the jobs I have is to thread that [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2341.2s)]
*  needle, is to make sure that the capital that the investors have given me is deployed wisely, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2347.44s)]
*  deployed efficiently and meeting the milestones required to demonstrate progress on that path to [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2353.2000000000003s)]
*  making the medicine. I'm not sure how you can impact it more except to say that you kind of [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2360.0s)]
*  you watch very carefully what it is you're spending money on. You try to give people some freedom but [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2369.04s)]
*  you know, I'll give you a concrete example at Exilio. We've made the decision to outsource the [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2375.52s)]
*  messenger RNA and lipid nanoparticle for the animal work that we need because we thought it [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2382.0800000000004s)]
*  would be more capital efficient. I've very much constrained the size of the team because, you know, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2386.8s)]
*  as we move things further along, the guys who are doing the early discovery, well, you know, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2393.44s)]
*  guess what? They want to keep doing early discovery and at a certain point I have to say, yeah, no, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2398.5600000000004s)]
*  you keep doing what you were doing yesterday and I need to do new stuff, that means I need to go [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2403.36s)]
*  hire more people. Well, we're actually going to constrain the size of the organization until we [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2407.2s)]
*  get to sort of our next milestone so I need you to do less of that and go over here and help your [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2412.2400000000002s)]
*  buddies who are kind of trying to move the ball down the field. Does Exilio have a CFO yet? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2417.92s)]
*  We have a CFO who's actually a venture partner with Orbit Met still and is a consultant to us [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2425.92s)]
*  as a company so I think our entire C-suite is pretty much consultants at this point which, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2433.6800000000003s)]
*  again, allows me to keep the cash burn lower. Yeah, yeah, fractional leadership approach, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2442.8s)]
*  so to speak, right? Well, yeah, I mean, if 80% is my time, then yes, you nailed it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2449.92s)]
*  It's an obtuse fraction. Well, this might seem a little bit like a non-sequitur of a question to [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2460.56s)]
*  ask but I actually think it's really essential because I think earlier on you were saying that [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2467.2000000000003s)]
*  without greater understanding of mRNA medicines, of any medicine in general, right, and being able [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2472.64s)]
*  to speak that same language, that your patients need to understand, that physicians need to [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2478.24s)]
*  understand all of the work that you're doing at Exilio and that the entire industry is doing [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2482.24s)]
*  today to bring mRNA therapeutics to market is going to be for naught, right, if people don't [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2487.9199999999996s)]
*  understand what they're doing. So, you know, kind of leaping from that commercial return of investment [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2492.8799999999997s)]
*  concept into the world of commercializing an mRNA therapeutic, right, you've emphasized the importance [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2500.64s)]
*  of that education and publications are one way to do that but we've also seen a couple of things [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2507.84s)]
*  happen in the past couple of weeks. We saw Moderna just released, I think, kind of the first of its [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2513.36s)]
*  kind, right, a free course on mRNA medicines to start educating the public about what these [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2518.56s)]
*  products are and what mRNA can do. Maybe should have done that three years ago. Just one idea. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2524.7200000000003s)]
*  Might have been a little good, you know, better around the time of the vaccine but here we are, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2530.8s)]
*  right, and we are still working ahead with that. But, you know, as someone that's now heading up a [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2535.68s)]
*  company in the mRNA therapeutic space, how do you think we should as an industry and individual [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2540.3999999999996s)]
*  companies, company leaders, be educating the public today about what these medicines are and [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2546.7999999999997s)]
*  even more importantly what they are not? What they do versus what they do not do? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2554.64s)]
*  Yeah, I honestly wish I had a good answer so I thought the answer was me talking to you guys. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2560.7999999999997s)]
*  You're telling me it's not? Well, it's part of the answer for sure. I mean, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2566.72s)]
*  part of the answer for sure. My mom, let's put it this way, my mom doesn't listen to this podcast [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2572.8799999999997s)]
*  so she's one of the ones who needs some education. That's true. So I'll raise you one. My mom does [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2577.2s)]
*  listen to this podcast and listen to everyone I do so. She's gonna be so proud when she hears you [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2584.16s)]
*  made two parts of the business of biotech, back-to-back episodes. But look, I think that [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2589.6s)]
*  it's incumbent upon us, upon all of us, to use whatever venue and resource we have in order to [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2596.16s)]
*  do that. I give Stefan Maderna a lot of credit for what they've done. I think Stefan's been a [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2602.96s)]
*  visionary from the get-go in educating the public and speaking about it in terms that are easy to [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2607.2799999999997s)]
*  understand in making sure that Maderna invested in those resources. And frankly, if you look at [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2614.56s)]
*  the history of Maderna, starting with educating the Maderna workforce about everything that they're [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2622.88s)]
*  doing. And I have a lot of admiration for his leadership in those regards. I think that [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2630.16s)]
*  there's not a one-size-fit-all here. I've tried to do it in whatever academic opportunities I've had. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2638.56s)]
*  When I think one of the things that scare people when it comes to nucleic acid technology, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2646.96s)]
*  mRNA, DNA, gene therapy is, are we messing with creation? And that's sort of a slippery slope. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2654.2400000000002s)]
*  Because everything you do around us is not as found by nature. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2665.68s)]
*  And I think what's important to explain to people is why we believe what we're doing is safe, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2674.3199999999997s)]
*  and why do we think it's got a benefit to people. And that's why we, who are at the forefront of [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2682.48s)]
*  why we, who are at the forefront of developing novel medicines, feel we have a moral imperative [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2689.76s)]
*  to develop novel treatments that are safe and effective. This is probably particularly [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2696.1600000000003s)]
*  relevant for gene therapy. And I can tell you, for many years when I was at Maderna, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2704.1600000000003s)]
*  I looked at a lot of the approaches. And I was on record at saying, as a medical oncologist, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2711.0400000000004s)]
*  some of those things scare me. And mRNA, the beauty of mRNA as opposed to gene therapy is that [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2716.88s)]
*  mRNA is very transient, does not integrate with the genome. The effects are gone in a day or two, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2723.36s)]
*  at least as far as protein production. And there's no longstanding effect. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2728.32s)]
*  And I have to tell you, Axelio is the first company that I'm sort of personally investing [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2737.6s)]
*  in both time and capital. And the primary reason for me to get involved here [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2743.12s)]
*  personally, beyond the curiosity and the path to medicine, is the sense that there's a potential [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2750.96s)]
*  for differentiating safety. The elements that, the specific elements that the folks described [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2756.48s)]
*  and discovered in our engineering are elements that live within our genome in places that are [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2764.2400000000002s)]
*  very safe. We have hundreds of repeat elements, and they're nowhere near any cancer-causing gene. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2769.68s)]
*  And so if our elements can really live specifically only in those places, then I'm much more [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2777.44s)]
*  comfortable as a medical oncologist that I can go and put a new gene in one of those places, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2782.96s)]
*  and it'll be fine. And so far, the specificity, that exquisite ability to only be there, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2787.7599999999998s)]
*  is maintained. And what got me confident is not sort of because we engineered it to be that way, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2795.36s)]
*  but because when the team started looking at these elements, they looked at nature across the tree [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2802.48s)]
*  of life, and they could only find them in that very specific area that's not close to any cancer- [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2807.68s)]
*  causing gene. And that gave me the confidence that these elements are indeed within a safe harbor [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2813.52s)]
*  location, and therefore if we go make a gene medicine based on this, it should indeed be safe. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2821.2s)]
*  Now, you know, we have to prove that, and we're developing the tools to prove it, and the onus [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2827.04s)]
*  of proof is of course on us. But if that holds true, then I feel very comfortable as a medical [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2832.48s)]
*  oncologist to say that I believe this should be both efficacious and safe to develop for patients. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2838.8799999999997s)]
*  It's the same framework that the FDA uses. It has to do with safety and efficacy, right? And [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2845.92s)]
*  the bar is probably different if you're- well, for sure it's different if you're talking about [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2856.48s)]
*  a cancer patient, or you're talking about a healthy person trying to get vaccinated against [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2860.6400000000003s)]
*  an infectious disease that they might not even get. And I think one of the things I've enjoyed [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2866.32s)]
*  most and learned most was the stark difference between the two and how it makes you think about [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2873.52s)]
*  medicine as a whole. You know, it's interesting, and people much smarter than me have spoken about [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2880.72s)]
*  this. The medicine as I practiced it, as I learned it, is treatment of sick people. And [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2888.56s)]
*  few people are sick as cancer patients with late stage disease. And so, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2897.92s)]
*  my goal is to take a person who's sick and cure them, right? Make them better. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2906.56s)]
*  Okay, my vision for that patient is actually their past. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2913.12s)]
*  The best I can hope for them is that they will be a few days before when they didn't have cancer. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2921.84s)]
*  We as physicians don't try to take healthy people or people who are clinically well [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2927.12s)]
*  and think about how do we make them healthier, how do we make them better? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2934.8799999999997s)]
*  That is something that we leave for- you know, that's an engineering mindset of continuous [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2938.56s)]
*  improvement. Physicians, we don't think about it. I'm a medical oncologist. I'm a serious physician. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2943.2s)]
*  I treat with serious illness. I don't make healthy people healthier. I mean, if you come to my office [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2948.08s)]
*  and you're healthy, well, get out of my office. What am I going to do for you, right? The people [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2953.52s)]
*  who make healthy people healthier, oh, we leave that to the yoga instructionist and the nutritionist. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2957.2s)]
*  Well, really? I mean, what did I do? I developed a vaccine that took healthy people and made them [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2964.96s)]
*  healthier when you think about it, right? And so, it kind of made me step back and think about [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2972.16s)]
*  what is it that we're trying to do as physicians? And I think that concept of benefit risk [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2979.52s)]
*  has to be put in the context of your health and what the benefit is that you anticipate. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2987.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Wow. That's it. I know. Yeah. You just opened up. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2994.8s)]
*  My mind is- I see the great time. It's all part three coming. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=2999.2s)]
*  There are like fireworks going off in my brain right now. I have no words. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3004.64s)]
*  I'm going to- we'll do that. Down the road, we'll do that. But I'm going to let you off the hook, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3010.4s)]
*  Dr. Zox, because you've given us so much of your time already. But I don't want to let you off the [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3016.64s)]
*  hook without giving you an opportunity to share with us a little bit about what is next on the [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3020.8s)]
*  immediate horizon besides finding a new CEO to replace you when you're- [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3026.4s)]
*  When you're ready. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3031.52s)]
*  When you're ready, when your contributions are- [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3032.32s)]
*  Far into the future. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3034.48s)]
*  Your contributions are waning. No, but seriously, what are sort of the next, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3035.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess, inflection points for Exilio? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3041.52s)]
*  I think for Exilio, it's to develop a technology to the point where we can [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3047.2s)]
*  start to show the utility in preclinical models of disease. That is sort of the next [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3053.12s)]
*  immediate milestone for us. For me, it's to build a company and to continue my journey at [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3058.8s)]
*  OrbiMed. I think as the fields, and we didn't touch on this, watching new technologies start [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3065.28s)]
*  to abut and make inroads into our industry, AI is the buzzword that everybody's using. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3073.84s)]
*  There's several stories I can share on where that stands today. That's been a fascinating thing for [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3079.92s)]
*  me to watch and learn and start to be part of. As I said, we're using some of those tools already [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3085.44s)]
*  at Exilio, but we're just in a very fortunate moment of time from a translating science into [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3090.8s)]
*  medicine perspective, given all the progress that's happening and accelerating in the world of [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3098.7200000000003s)]
*  science. I'm just super jazzed to be able to be part of translating all that into actually people [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3104.0s)]
*  feeling better and living longer. Yeah. Yeah. The AI angle is one, I think, for another, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3111.84s)]
*  fodder for another day. It is fascinating to me, and I'm super interested in your perspective on [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3118.24s)]
*  that, given your perspective, right? You're a physician, you're a scientist. A lot of folks in [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3123.9199999999996s)]
*  your community are skeptical. I think the most in-depth and convincing conversations I've had [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3133.2799999999997s)]
*  with companies that are playing with AI have come from AI companies who just happen to be [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3138.7999999999997s)]
*  working in our industry or perhaps developing a demonstrable pipeline based on that technology. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3143.68s)]
*  When I talk to the hardcore folks, there's all sorts of skepticism. I would like to open up [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3150.16s)]
*  that conversation with you sometime, but again, we need to wrap things up here today. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDi22UVLhE0&t=3156.0s)]
