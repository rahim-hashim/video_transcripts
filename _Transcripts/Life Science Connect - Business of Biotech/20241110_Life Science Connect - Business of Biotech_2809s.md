Video Description: On this episode of the Business of Biotech, Bill and Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute's Dr. Claire Wagner joins us to share insights into her work as head of Corporate Strategy and Market Access there. She shares the development of her North Star while working with the incomparable Dr. Paul Farmer in Rwanda, and how that experience translates to the growth of a biopharmaceutical company taking big swings for grossly underserved populations. We discuss the nuances associated with setting strategy and enabling product access in a unique not-for-profit setting, and how, perhaps counterintuitively, the Institute's work fits synergistically into an ultra-competitive for-profit biopharma landscape.

# Serving The Underserved With Gates MRI's Claire Wagner, M.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4)
*  The Bill and Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute, well known as it may be, does not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=0.0s)]
*  get a ton of ink in the biotech business trades, in part because there's no trading going on. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=9.28s)]
*  Gates MRI is a non-profit biotech launched in 2018 and funded by the Gates Foundation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=17.3s)]
*  As such, there's no dramatic story of a hard fought and oversubscribed Series A during [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=23.28s)]
*  COVID times. There's no plans to IPO in a bear market. There's no clawing its way back from [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  the brink of bankruptcy. But the things that Gates MRI does have in spades and the things [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=34.52s)]
*  that more traditional public and private biotech companies can learn from it are many. It's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=41.2s)]
*  got drug development partnership deals with companies like GSK, Merck, Novavax and others. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=47.28s)]
*  It's got an all-star leadership team. Astute listeners will remember that Gates MRI head of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=53.72s)]
*  CMC, Dr. Piper Trelstad, joined me on episode 132 of the podcast. And Bioprocess Online followers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=59.68s)]
*  might recall my recent profile of the juggernaut chief operating officer, Deborah Weiss. Perhaps [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=67.44s)]
*  most importantly, Gates MRI has a carefully curated pipeline of candidates, custom-built [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  to address unmet medical needs, primarily affecting women and children in underprivileged [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=80.8s)]
*  parts of the world. And those candidates are moving fast. Its B. Infantis candidate is in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=85.56s)]
*  phase three. Its tuberculosis vaccine just entered phase three. And it's got four or five additional [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  clinical programs at various stages in shigella, tuberculosis and malaria, and a handful of pre [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  clinical programs beyond that. Central to the global humanitarian mission at Gates MRI are its [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=104.48s)]
*  people, many of whom have more than just hands-on in the lab experience, developing new medicines, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=111.92s)]
*  but also boots on the ground experience, building the life sciences industries in underserved parts [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=118.48s)]
*  of the world. I'm Matt Piller. This is The Business of Biotech. And my guest on today's show is [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  exemplary of that persona. She is Dr. Claire Wagner, head of corporate strategy and market access at [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=129.64s)]
*  Gates MRI. And on this episode of the podcast, we're going to get to know her. We're going to get to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  know her work and the broader impact of Gates MRI in the business of biotech. Dr. Wagner, welcome to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=140.83999999999997s)]
*  the show. Thanks, Matt. Great to be here. And thank you for very kind and generous introduction. It's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=146.92s)]
*  really lovely to be part of your show. It's super lovely for you to be part of our show. You know, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  I was excited at the opportunity to have you on the show and talk with you in large part because [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=159.16s)]
*  of your super rich experiences even prior to coming to Gates MRI. And I want to start there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=164.84s)]
*  I want to start by sort of getting a sense of who Dr. Claire Wagner is. And I'm going to give our [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=172.52s)]
*  listeners just a little bit of background on you to set that conversation up. You followed up your [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=180.04s)]
*  Dartmouth undergrad in anthropology with a Harvard Medical School, MD and an MBA. And when I look at [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=186.52s)]
*  that mix and I think about the current position that you're in at Gates MRI and the Gates mission, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=193.08s)]
*  it seems like that was a carefully curated foundation for the role that you play today. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=199.08s)]
*  I'm sure it wasn't though, because there were a lot of stops along the way that we're going to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=205.24s)]
*  learn about today. But if you take us back to that time, like coming out of Dartmouth, going to med [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  school and kind of thinking about what you wanted to do professionally, what were your intentions? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=214.44s)]
*  I mean, assuming that you weren't carefully curating this role prior to Gates MRI even being a thing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=221.16s)]
*  No, I think that's right, Matt. There is, as with many people's careers, maybe everybody's careers, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=228.52s)]
*  it's really quite nonlinear. And I would say a lot of the decisions that I ended up being able [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=234.84s)]
*  and having the privilege to make from a career standpoint and an education standpoint came from [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=245.56s)]
*  some luck and the identification and seizure of that luck and so seizing of that luck. And so [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=252.52s)]
*  I, after college, I had the incredible opportunity to take a role working in Rwanda. It was supposed [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=260.68s)]
*  to be a 10 month role. It ended up being a three year full time in Kigali role, a couple years [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=270.12s)]
*  after that back and forth. And as my now late mentor, Paul Farmer used to say, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=278.52s)]
*  there is no post Rwanda. There is no time in your life where you won't be connected to this place [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  that will give you so much. And that was really true from my experience there. And the five years [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=293.32s)]
*  I spent doing work in Rwanda and with colleagues in the global health space after college, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=300.76s)]
*  those were the years and the experiences that ultimately drove me to pursue medicine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=309.56s)]
*  And then later to pursue business. And I actually had, as you said, there wasn't much [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=315.08s)]
*  strategic to it. I did not have an intention to be in this role. Certainly this organization [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=323.79999999999995s)]
*  didn't exist. I hadn't even done pre-medical training. So part of going to med school for me [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=329.24s)]
*  meant going back and doing physics and chemistry and organic chemistry and biology. The classes [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=336.12s)]
*  you usually take when you're 18, 19, I was a decade beyond that. And I'm grateful that I had [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=343.0s)]
*  the opportunity to go back and do those studies and pursue the advanced degrees that I then was [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=351.96s)]
*  able to do in service of the values that were instilled in me during my experiences in Rwanda. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=359.48s)]
*  Yeah. So we're going to get into that. And I've got some questions for you about Dr. Farmer. I've [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=371.32s)]
*  read up on him and watched some of his interviews on YouTube. And I've formed an opinion of the man. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=377.24s)]
*  I want to ask you about yours before I offer mine. But before we get to that, the opportunity to go [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=386.2s)]
*  to Rwanda, how did it present itself? And why was this even a thing on your radar? Why was it an [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=391.72s)]
*  option? My kids are doing amazing things. I've got a 20-year-old and an 18-year-old. I've got [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=398.52s)]
*  a 20-year-old son. If someone came up to him and said, hey, I have an opportunity for you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=403.4s)]
*  You can go to Rwanda for 10 months. He'd be like, yeah, that's really not on my bingo card. So [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=408.28s)]
*  what at the time, why was that an appealing move for you? I suppose some of it was part of growing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=414.12s)]
*  up in a very international home where my parents, that was part of my childhood, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=423.8s)]
*  was being at the dinner table surrounded by colleagues and friends of theirs from all over [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=429.88000000000005s)]
*  the world. My dad does international education work, was in the Peace Corps in Morocco in the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=434.76000000000005s)]
*  60s, still works in Morocco to this day. And so I had a lot of exposure to global oriented things [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=439.0s)]
*  from an early stage and ultimately realized that, and as I went through my studies and then in [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=447.8s)]
*  college, knew that I wanted to make a contribution to global issues in some way, shape, or form. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=456.2s)]
*  And it was during college that I was exposed to what is called or has later been called global [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=465.64s)]
*  health, which is really a catch all phrase and maybe doesn't describe the field perfectly, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=473.16s)]
*  but those were some opportunities that I had while I was in school to work and do research. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  I did research in Tanzania and also did some work in Mali when I was an undergraduate and knew that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=489.24s)]
*  I was interested in being part of global health efforts, broadly speaking. And that a very [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=495.72s)]
*  fortuitous thing happened and the president of Dartmouth College in my senior year became [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=502.28s)]
*  Jim Kim. He was hired to be the new president and he had founded Partners in Health with [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=508.84s)]
*  Paul Farmer and Ophelia Dahl. And so suddenly there was this influx of global health enthusiasm [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=515.88s)]
*  and excitement on campus. And it was through Jim who became a mentor to me and still is a mentor [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=522.68s)]
*  to me that I had the opportunity to meet Paul and meet the, who would be the future minister [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=530.04s)]
*  of health of Rwanda, Dr. Agnes Beneguajo, and be aware of and then apply for the opportunity to go [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=536.92s)]
*  work for Dr. Agnes and Paul in Rwanda. So that's really the kind of long story of how I came to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=546.28s)]
*  be aware of that opportunity. But it was a one-line job description. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=555.24s)]
*  So I didn't know exactly what I was going to be doing. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=562.44s)]
*  Give us the Cliffs Note. You don't need the Cliffs Notes on a one-line job description. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=568.2s)]
*  Do you remember the exact line? What was the line? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=572.76s)]
*  Yeah, I remember the moment I opened the email and all of the rest. There's an opportunity to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=575.16s)]
*  be the research assistant to Dr. Agnes Beneguajo full-time in Kigali, Rwanda, period. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=580.04s)]
*  And you're like, yeah. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=588.28s)]
*  I said, yeah. I had applied to a bunch of other jobs, rescinded my applications, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  and a couple months later I was on a plane to Kigali. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=594.92s)]
*  So the Dr. Farmer connection was established with Dartmouth. Did you know at the time that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=600.5999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Farmer was kind of a big deal? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=607.8s)]
*  Yeah, it was right around the time, or it must have been after, but there was a book written [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=611.2399999999999s)]
*  about him and he was a legend already then in my head and in many people's heads. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=618.28s)]
*  Let me interrupt you real quick because I also happen to know that he too was an anthropologist [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=626.92s)]
*  turned medicine maker. Were you aware of this? Was this alignment part of your calculus? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=634.76s)]
*  Oh, there was no calculus, but it was definitely the inspiration and drive. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=645.7199999999999s)]
*  I thought the world of him, I think the world of him, and I also was really curious through [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=651.96s)]
*  the experiences that I had as a kid about international education through my dad, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=665.8s)]
*  about global issues through coursework. I had the opportunity to take on [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=672.36s)]
*  and really knew that I wanted to contribute in that way. So having the opportunity to learn [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=680.52s)]
*  through the lens of anthropology made a lot of sense to me. It just clicked for me that approaching [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=689.88s)]
*  an opportunity to contribute with the lens of curiosity, engagement, respect, those are all [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=701.4s)]
*  part of the kind of tools that you learn when you're studying anthropology, how to ask questions [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=708.76s)]
*  in certain ways or others, how to engage in a community in certain ways or others, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=716.2s)]
*  how to be respectful of cultures and how to embed yourself in a new environment that might be [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=722.5200000000001s)]
*  unfamiliar to you. I got a lot out of that kind of mindset and training. It just clicked. It was [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=731.8000000000001s)]
*  certainly the inspiration of Paul and Jim having done that. It also was how I was brought up. I [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=743.48s)]
*  think it worked in my mind. My mom is a psychologist and my dad is in international education and [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=753.1600000000001s)]
*  anthropology is a good way to approach learning in a global environment. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=760.12s)]
*  So tell us, and I feel bad for our listeners because if you're not familiar with the work of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=774.12s)]
*  Dr. Paul Farmer, we're about to make you, I'll be briefly familiar with who he is and what he did. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=779.16s)]
*  So I want two perspectives from you, Dr. Wagner, on Paul. One, just share with our audience who he [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  was from a professional standpoint. And then two, I'd like you to share a little bit about who he [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=794.04s)]
*  was to you on a professional and personal level. So we could spend an hour talking about all the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  professional things. I'll interrupt you again real quick. We'll give you the Cliffs Notes for [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=807.2399999999999s)]
*  real this time. Just hit YouTube. I mean, there's so much fascinating content featuring Dr. Farmer [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=814.44s)]
*  and his work. So Paul co-founded, as I mentioned, Partners in Health with Ophelia Dahl and Jim Kim [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=820.44s)]
*  in 1987. Partners in Health has then become a very major global health organization around the world [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=827.32s)]
*  with sister organizations in many countries around the world. And in addition to that work that Paul [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=834.6800000000001s)]
*  did, he taught for many, many years in the Harvard Medical School community courses in global health, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=840.04s)]
*  medical anthropology, and so forth. And I think there are a lot of pioneering, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=847.9599999999999s)]
*  there was a lot of pioneering work that he did and a huge number of changes that he ushered along [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=858.28s)]
*  and fought for in the global health community that we can look back and say, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=865.4s)]
*  yes, that was Paul. That was Paul's work. In addition to the [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=869.88s)]
*  innumerable ways that he changed the global health landscape and global health architecture, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=878.68s)]
*  he also brought up many, many people. And I am a very fortunate one of those many, many, many people [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=886.92s)]
*  who he took under his wing. And he made every mentee that he had feel like they were the only [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=898.52s)]
*  mentee of his. And it was a remarkable thing. And I feel very fortunate to have [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=906.52s)]
*  been mentored by him for the years that I was. This guy had access. He had access into the upper [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=915.88s)]
*  reaches of important people in global health. And yet, I get that sense. I was going to say, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=927.88s)]
*  I wanted your perspective. And then I was going to share just mine from a million miles away. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=934.28s)]
*  I think those YouTube videos I reference are a great example. Go check them out. You get the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=939.0s)]
*  sense that this guy's presence, like his presence with you, with the person who's asking him [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=943.4s)]
*  questions, with the person he's working with, is uncommon. It's uncommon for a person to have that [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  kind of presence and engagement in a meaningful way with the person that they're speaking with. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  And I get the sense that he took that with him wherever he went. And it didn't matter what color [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=962.84s)]
*  the person was that he was working with. It didn't matter what language they spoke. He was [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=968.68s)]
*  engaged for humanity. He was. He was. And on our badges here at Gates MRI, we have the phrase, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=973.64s)]
*  all lives have equal value. And he lived that every day. He would spend the same amount of [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=983.0s)]
*  deep quality conversation time with the head of the WHO as he would with the person who was [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=991.0s)]
*  in charge of sanitation in one of the hospitals that he helped found. He knew the names of [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1002.12s)]
*  all the patients on the way. It was just incredible when I would round on patients with him in Rwanda, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1010.28s)]
*  which wasn't often. He knew every patient's name, every patient's parents name who was there with [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1014.92s)]
*  them. He knew he just, he just had this way about him, just like you said, of being so deeply [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1021.08s)]
*  connected and embedded in the community that he was in and having the presence with each individual [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1028.92s)]
*  in a way that I think is quite unusual. Yeah. So how did that sort of inform you? You know, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1035.96s)]
*  you said you went into it with international and cultural curiosity. How did that experience [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1044.6000000000001s)]
*  kind of form up your next steps? I mean, I'm assuming you kind of doubled down, right? Like, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1052.1200000000001s)]
*  how did that experience kind of inform what you did next? And we'll talk about those positions [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1058.8400000000001s)]
*  that you took between then and Gates MRI. Yeah. So much of my time in Rwanda was working with Paul. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1065.0s)]
*  Also much of my time in Rwanda was working with the minister of health, Dr. Niaspen Nguajo, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1075.64s)]
*  who is, we could spend a whole nother podcast talking about her career and the pioneering work [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1080.28s)]
*  that she did and all that I learned from her. And I have a colleague who says every day with [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1086.52s)]
*  her was like getting a master's degree and I would stand by that. And the changes that she made to [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1091.24s)]
*  the global health architecture are also too numerous to count. And she and Paul were thick [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1100.6s)]
*  as thieves in doing the work that they did. And so one of the things though, during those years [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1105.0s)]
*  that I was there, I did have the opportunity to, on my personal time, shadow in a public referral [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1113.72s)]
*  hospital in Kigali. That gave me a lens that was quite different from working in the public sector [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1119.96s)]
*  at the level of policymaking and product introduction. Here I was in a pediatric unit, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1127.56s)]
*  specifically shadowing physicians who were taking care of kids who had heart disease and cancer. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1134.1200000000001s)]
*  And what I observed at the time there was a setting that some described as being like HIV was 20 years [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1141.96s)]
*  before, 10 or 20 years before, where patients go to this ward, the pediatric cardiology ward, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1154.76s)]
*  basically to die. There was no solution. There were no oncology products being procured in the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1162.68s)]
*  public referral hospital at that time. And so I witnessed through the patients that we rounded on, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1169.88s)]
*  unfortunately, many of whom did pass away during that time and watched as the physicians tried to [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1177.64s)]
*  pool their funds to source drugs on the private market to try to treat these kids with cancer, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1182.92s)]
*  for example, that there was this gap between technology and products and people who needed [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1191.64s)]
*  them. It is pretty obvious, right? It's not a big, profound realization, but the fact that that gap [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1199.0s)]
*  felt so, this is not really a word, but unapproximatable, right? It was very difficult, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1209.3200000000002s)]
*  almost intractable to approximate the product with the patient in those settings. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1218.28s)]
*  I got really curious about that and I applied to medical school because of that. And I applied [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1225.16s)]
*  to business school because of that, because I am driven by this idea that it doesn't have to be [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1232.2s)]
*  that way, that the products are out there, the money is out there, the people are out there, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1241.0s)]
*  and the patients are out there. And if we can get the right kind of architecture set up between all [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1248.6s)]
*  of those stakeholders and resources, we can make a big difference. And that is why I set out on the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1255.96s)]
*  journey to go back and do all of the schooling and then ultimately what led me to Gates MRI, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1266.12s)]
*  because of the mission that we have here to develop products for diseases that have a [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1274.04s)]
*  tremendous burden in low-income settings, low- and middle-income settings, and the opportunity to [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1281.56s)]
*  build out how we are going to ensure access, affordability, equitable distribution of the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1291.08s)]
*  products that we develop in those marketplaces. That is what makes me excited every day to go to [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1300.44s)]
*  work. Yeah. With your credentials, your experiences, your background, you could, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1307.88s)]
*  I'm going to pose the question like this, you could have very likely taken a position with [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1319.24s)]
*  any number of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, even biotech companies that [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1326.04s)]
*  profess the mission toward the democratization of medicine. There are a lot of them. There are a lot [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1334.6s)]
*  of companies out there that are, yeah, we want to make them more affordable, more distributable, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1342.36s)]
*  more equitable. We want to democratize access. Why Gates MRI? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1347.96s)]
*  Well, first up, so Gates MRI, we are a six-year-old organization, six-plus-year-old organization, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  and we get to be at this intersection of big global health problem and commercial approaches [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1366.68s)]
*  to solving that problem without the need for a return on investment. That means that we have [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1378.68s)]
*  the privilege, it's really a privilege, to make certain decisions on access, on addressing target, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1383.96s)]
*  on creating target product profiles, on addressing different characteristics that the WHO will look [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1390.28s)]
*  for, for a policy recommendation, for example, that other entities may have more constraints on. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1395.96s)]
*  We don't have shareholders per se that we are answering to in quarterly earnings calls. We have [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1403.08s)]
*  a very different set of metrics that we are accountable for, and those have to do with [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1409.72s)]
*  developing products that are aligned with major global health disease burdens [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1416.92s)]
*  and that can be accessible in the marketplaces that we serve. I do think, though, that [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1424.12s)]
*  I'm glad there's competition. I hope there's competition. One of the great outcomes of the [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1434.9199999999998s)]
*  Gates MRI as a, let's call it an experiment of the Gates Foundation to found us six and plus years ago [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1443.96s)]
*  would be that there's more Gates MRIs. That would be a great outcome in my view. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1451.96s)]
*  And having other biotechs and pharmaceutical companies take on roles in the global health [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1458.12s)]
*  ecosystem through their charitable foundations or through their commercial branches in their [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1468.44s)]
*  global health groups, and we work with some of those groups, and they're fantastic. And I think [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1475.08s)]
*  the more the merrier, and even Paul would say that, right? More people around the table [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1481.32s)]
*  to do this work. And another element of our business model that I think is [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1489.24s)]
*  another privilege that we have is this opportunity to collaborate. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1497.24s)]
*  Our ability to work through and with and in partnership with both commercial partners, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1501.9599999999998s)]
*  philanthropic partners, and downstream partners that will help us ensure access to our products [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1509.48s)]
*  in low and middle income markets. That's another element that really drew me into this organization [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1518.84s)]
*  and is a big part of what we do at Gates MRI. Okay, yeah. So walk me through this. I [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1528.52s)]
*  use the term that I've read this before. Explain to me like I'm 11. How you can rationalize? So [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1539.48s)]
*  like, if I dumb this down to the lowest common denominator and I say, well, a capitalist would [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1547.08s)]
*  suggest to you, Dr. Claire Wagner, that running a business that moves product, regardless of need, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1551.88s)]
*  anywhere without any expectation of return on investment is not sustainable. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1560.52s)]
*  So that maybe, I mean, I learned something in business school and that may be not untrue, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1570.2s)]
*  right? But so you need, there has to be some [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1578.2s)]
*  generation of money in the bank, right? You've got to bring in financing to do the work that you do, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1585.64s)]
*  because it's expensive work. If you look at any of our press releases, you will see how many zeros [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1592.52s)]
*  are in the dollar sign of how much it costs to do the studies that we do. So [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1597.72s)]
*  our own goal at Gates MRI is not profit. We are a non-for-profit. Our goal is impact and we're [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1605.8000000000002s)]
*  fortunate that our funders are looking for that, right? That's what they're looking for. So when we [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1614.68s)]
*  go to our annual meeting with our funders and when we have our governance meetings, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1622.84s)]
*  that's what we're accountable for is impact and potential for impact through the products that [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1628.6s)]
*  we're developing. I think in a normal, in a sort of in the biotech, biopharmaceutical ecosystem, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1633.0s)]
*  it is quite different, as you say. You do have a different set of metrics by which you're being [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1641.08s)]
*  measured. Cost of capital is not cheap for many young companies trying to do big things. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1646.92s)]
*  The financing world is evolving to address some of those problems and there's a lot of new types of [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1660.04s)]
*  non-dilutive financing that are out there. But I see it as a real opportunity for us to play a big [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1667.8000000000002s)]
*  role in this ecosystem because we get to be measured by impact and that's a special thing. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1675.08s)]
*  Mike For sure. Yeah. When you joined Gates MRI, you joined as chief of staff, is that correct? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1683.08s)]
*  Like you didn't come on in your current role, although it seems like you were, you know, kind [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1691.0s)]
*  of custom cut for the current role that you're in. What was the opportunity as chief of staff? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1695.8s)]
*  Dr. Mildred Just like any other organization, we have grown and we've evolved. And four and a half, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1701.6399999999999s)]
*  four plus years ago when I joined, we looked quite different. We had a different set of things that [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1709.48s)]
*  we were doing. We had a different composition and it was COVID. So we weren't even in the office. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1714.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't think I met anyone until about a year in. And so what I really think is [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1722.52s)]
*  a great part about being with a young organization is the opportunity to identify a business need [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1735.56s)]
*  and start to test out how to solve that business need. And so at the time when I joined, the [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1741.96s)]
*  business need was chief of staff. And as I continued on here at Gates MRI, and as we evolved and [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1748.2s)]
*  our portfolio grew and the products in our portfolio advanced to later stages, we identified this new [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1754.2s)]
*  business need to really think about access and how are we going to work with our partners at the [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1763.0800000000002s)]
*  Gates Foundation and with our other commercial and philanthropic partners to ensure access and [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1771.56s)]
*  impact. And so that was then the business need. And I'm fortunate to have been able to grow here [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1777.32s)]
*  to address some of those business needs. And I do feel that it draws on the many different types [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1784.04s)]
*  of product introductions that I had a chance to be a part of in Rwanda, working with the WHO and the [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1791.6399999999999s)]
*  essential medicines list, working with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and a number of different roles. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1797.96s)]
*  This really is, I am able to bring in a lot of prior experience to this role. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1802.44s)]
*  Scott Payne Yeah, yeah. And that role, I mean, as we said, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1810.76s)]
*  head of corporate strategy and market access, it occurs to me that looking at the mission at [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1815.24s)]
*  Gates MRI, there are multiple things that are super central to that, like the legs of the stool. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1821.72s)]
*  Like we need to produce in volume, vaccines and therapeutics that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1828.84s)]
*  address these unmet needs in these places. We need to get them there. That's central. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1838.1999999999998s)]
*  We need to get them there in a timely and efficient manner. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1843.32s)]
*  That element of your job, like figuring that out seems like everything. I mean, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1850.76s)]
*  not everything, but it's one of the things that has to happen for Gates MRI to address its mission. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1857.32s)]
*  What does that feel like? It feels pretty like a heavy responsibility. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1868.4399999999998s)]
*  So I guess I'm going to get to a question here. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1873.3999999999999s)]
*  What does that responsibility feel like and what are you doing to meet it? What does that look like? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1878.84s)]
*  I mean, you say you're drawing a lot of a lot of these experience from your past. And [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1884.2s)]
*  when you, I guess, scale those experiences up from, you know, a hospital that Paul built in Rwanda [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1889.0s)]
*  to a global mission, what are those responsibilities look like? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1897.88s)]
*  So terribly worded question. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1903.48s)]
*  No, no, no. I gotcha. So our portfolio spans different disease areas, TB, malaria, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1906.52s)]
*  infant malnutrition. It also spans product types. So in TB, for example, we have a TB vaccine, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1919.8s)]
*  we have a TB treatment program, we have, and in malaria, we have a malaria monoclonal program, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1929.4s)]
*  monoclonal antibody program, as well as a, as you mentioned at the start, a program [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1936.52s)]
*  to address infant malnutrition called our B Infantist program, which is a probiotic. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1943.16s)]
*  Each of those being at various stages of development requires a different lens in terms of [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1949.0s)]
*  so-called market access. And when I refer to market access, I'm talking about this, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1956.36s)]
*  the suite of activities that are required basically to get a product from, let's say, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1960.12s)]
*  R&D to a patient. It's very broad. It's used in lots of different ways and different functions, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1965.1599999999999s)]
*  and it can take on lots of different meanings. But in this particular setting, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1970.52s)]
*  let's take that as our example. So for an earlier stage product, or let's say a product that you [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1975.1599999999999s)]
*  haven't quite brought into your portfolio, that might look like doing things like a global policy [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1981.4799999999998s)]
*  landscape, developing a value proposition, demand forecast, and so forth. And as you move through, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1985.96s)]
*  as you're refining some of those vantage points on the actual product, you're going to start [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1991.48s)]
*  looking at your cost of goods. You're going to start developing your end user segmentation, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=1997.16s)]
*  your business plan to get this product to market. And for example, in our TB vaccine program, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2005.56s)]
*  the M72 AS01 program, we're now at the phase where we're deep into the enrollment of this trial. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2011.96s)]
*  It's a really exciting time. This is a product that is for the prevention of active pulmonary [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2018.92s)]
*  tuberculosis. A quarter of the world's population is thought to be latently infected with TB. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2025.48s)]
*  That is a lot of people. Our vaccine is designed to prevent the conversion to active TB. It's a [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2032.8400000000001s)]
*  very expensive study. It takes a long time. And yet we haven't had a new vaccine for TB in over [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2040.28s)]
*  a hundred years. And so the opportunity that the Gates Foundation saw to bring this into Gates MRI [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2049.08s)]
*  and have us usher forward the phase three development was just an incalculable opportunity [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2056.44s)]
*  for public health impact. So the work that we get to do now in collaboration with our [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2064.68s)]
*  commercial partner, GSK, as you mentioned earlier, as well as our partners at the Gates Foundation [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2073.3999999999996s)]
*  and Welcome that are our funders, but also our collaborators on a lot of the actual work that [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2079.8799999999997s)]
*  we're doing to think about access, advocacy, policy engagement, new product introduction. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2085.96s)]
*  This is a new product class. There is no adult vaccine for tuberculosis out there. The only [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2092.2s)]
*  vaccine that I mentioned earlier over a hundred years ago, but that was developed over a hundred [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2098.2799999999997s)]
*  years ago is for kids. It's not for adults. So our studies, which are being run all over the world [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2102.12s)]
*  and in seven countries in Africa and Asia are really designed to answer the question of, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2116.2s)]
*  could this vaccine be efficacious and have the kind of public health impact that we [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2125.56s)]
*  hope it could have? To your specific question about the work that we're doing now to make that [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2132.68s)]
*  a reality, I'll come back to one of the words that we were talking about before around collaboration. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2138.7599999999998s)]
*  It is really through collaboration, both with the set of our core partners, so our philanthropic [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2145.16s)]
*  and commercial partners, but also ultimately the future payers, the future users, the procurement [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2150.2799999999997s)]
*  agencies. There are many, many different types of stakeholders that our being have been, will [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2158.8399999999997s)]
*  continue to be, and will ultimately be collectively engaged in ensuring this product gets to market. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2167.3999999999996s)]
*  The work that we get to do now is on really access and launch planning. How will that look? What are [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2173.48s)]
*  the different types of financial architecture that will need to be stood up? What are the different [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2182.2s)]
*  policy recommendations that are on the critical path? How do we set ourselves up for success with [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2188.2s)]
*  a commercial partner to commercialize the actual product? We will not be the entity on the label. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2198.04s)]
*  It will be another company. Some of the work has to do with that, commercial engagement, due diligence. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2207.0800000000004s)]
*  The suite of activities under market access is quite long, and we could spend a lot of time [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2217.48s)]
*  talking about it. I think the core of it is going to be around [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2222.04s)]
*  implementing the values that the Gates Foundation has around all lives having equal value, and that [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2232.2799999999997s)]
*  Welcome has around equitable access, and about capacity building and engagement with clinical [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2240.2799999999997s)]
*  trial leaders in the countries where we're working. We are not a human capital development [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2246.68s)]
*  organization, but everything that we do is through brilliant leaders and clinical trialists all over [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2258.44s)]
*  the world. Through that, we get to have this opportunity for bidirectional learning and [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2265.24s)]
*  engagement and capacity building in the settings where our clinical trials are being done. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2271.56s)]
*  If you could just reflect for a couple of minutes, I know we're going to run short on time here, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2283.0s)]
*  and I've got a couple more important questions I want to get to. The complexity, you talk about [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2286.36s)]
*  the payer landscape. Usually when I'm talking to a biotech exec who's talking about the payer [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2291.7999999999997s)]
*  landscape, they're talking about the payer landscape in the United States of America, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2296.12s)]
*  or in Europe, maybe in Asia. You're talking about a payer landscape that has a global payer [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2299.24s)]
*  landscape with all sorts of different facets and crevasses and things to negotiate. Between that, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2306.2s)]
*  the clinical landscape operating on a global scale as you are, it sounds like it would take [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2315.7999999999997s)]
*  an entire practice at Gates MRI to manage the logistics and complexity of those things. How [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2320.7599999999998s)]
*  are you going about that? This would also be worthy of a whole- [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2327.32s)]
*  We're going to need to book a lot more time with you, Dr. Wagner. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2336.36s)]
*  Really through the partnerships that we have established. In our organization, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2341.6400000000003s)]
*  we look similar to a pharmaceutical company in that under the hood, you'd find all of the same [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2348.52s)]
*  functions, right? CMC, regulatory, clinical development, clinical operations, and so forth. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2359.08s)]
*  But we maintain a pretty lean setup so that we can be agile to address the needs of the- [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2365.1600000000003s)]
*  address to conduct the work that we need to do and address the public health needs. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2375.16s)]
*  In that kind of setup, which is a certain type of business model, right? In business school, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2382.04s)]
*  you learn about all kinds of build, buy, borrow models that you can implement in any organization. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2387.3199999999997s)]
*  That's the same for us. This is the model that we have chosen to work around or to work with. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2392.3599999999997s)]
*  And that kind of model, though, means that you are set up to work on [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2397.48s)]
*  efforts with your partners. And that has to be a core capability, is engagement with your partners. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2408.36s)]
*  And so I would say that the very short answer to what your question was is that we can't do it all. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2414.92s)]
*  We don't do it all. We work through our partners and collaborators to do it. And we rely on [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2422.76s)]
*  our partners and collaborators and on ourselves to be mission driven. And that [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2434.28s)]
*  you're coming to the table because you have a passion to do this work. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2441.0800000000004s)]
*  And I subscribe to the idea that the world runs on passion. Okay, the world also runs on money, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2445.1600000000003s)]
*  but the world also runs on passion. And I think that we see that a lot here at Gates MRI. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2451.72s)]
*  The many nights and weekends and intense hours that are put in by all functions, all members of [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2457.0s)]
*  our organization to get this work done is reflective of the kind of mission orientation [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2468.3599999999997s)]
*  that is attracted to this type of organization, including myself. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2475.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, so in the time that we have left, one more question for you. And that is, as you can tell, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2481.72s)]
*  I mean, throughout the course of the conversation, I've been trying, I've been attempting to draw [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2487.16s)]
*  parallels between the nonprofit nature of Gates MRI and the for-profit nature of public and private [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2490.52s)]
*  biotechs that comprise the bulk of our business and biotech audience. And you've done a fantastic [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2498.2799999999997s)]
*  job, by the way, of exposing the valuable lessons that whether you're for-profit or not, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2504.04s)]
*  Gates MRI is setting, the examples that Gates MRI is setting. So we've been kind of doing that [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2512.52s)]
*  as we go. But if I were to ask you point blank, like, what's your opinion on the takeaway or two [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2519.64s)]
*  that you would like to impress upon biotechs of all stripes, you know, mostly the for-profit guys. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2528.6s)]
*  What would you like to impress upon them that the Gates MRI is doing and doing well and can be, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2537.4s)]
*  you know, replicated or at least considered in those companies' access and distribution models? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2544.6s)]
*  Thanks, Matt. Great question. One of the elements that I've seen play out from a number of different [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2550.76s)]
*  lenses that I've had the opportunity to have over time, both in Rwanda with working with the WHO and [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2562.5200000000004s)]
*  now at Gates MRI is that it's never too early to start thinking about access. From the very earliest [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2569.6400000000003s)]
*  stage of product development, when you're just thinking about a product, you should be thinking [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2578.84s)]
*  about access. What are the different characteristics that need to be fulfilled in your target product [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2584.6800000000003s)]
*  profile for this product to have a bigger market? What is the critical path for this product to get [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2591.4s)]
*  to XYZ markets around the world? We are so very focused on the US, the EU5, Japan, and so forth. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2599.08s)]
*  We haven't quite from a very, very early stage yet looked at access with a more global landscape. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2609.72s)]
*  I say we, putting myself in that bucket, I think we can always do a better job of doing that. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2622.36s)]
*  Where I would really encourage us all in the global biotech ecosystem to look at more is, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2630.84s)]
*  what are those very early decisions that you can make from the ideation phase all the way through [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2640.76s)]
*  phase three that will ensure equitable access to a product in global markets? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2647.96s)]
*  I know we're short on time and you need to leave. One last question, and you can make it a super [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2656.36s)]
*  quick response. You seem happy in this role that you have now. Coming off all these awesome [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2661.64s)]
*  experiences, you seem happy and you seem like you're inspired to do good work and you're doing great [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2669.4s)]
*  work. When this tuberculosis vaccine is approved and is ready for distribution, is there a part? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2674.92s)]
*  Yeah, is there a part? Those of you listening, there were fingers crossed just now. Is there [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2682.84s)]
*  a part of you, a little part of you that maybe hopes to be part of the team that's unloading [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2688.44s)]
*  these things from the airplanes and shipping them to hospitals back in places like Rwanda? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2695.56s)]
*  Oh my goodness. A great image to have in one's mind. There's nothing better than to think about [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2700.36s)]
*  that. Yes, I think the impact is the name of the game here and we are working day in and day out [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2706.28s)]
*  to make sure that that does become a reality. Certainly, I hope that that happens sooner rather [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2716.6800000000003s)]
*  than later and we all have fingers and toes crossed that the phase 2B will play out in phase [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2728.28s)]
*  three for this TB vaccine. Well, Dr. Wagner, I will let you get on with your day. I appreciate [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2734.76s)]
*  you coming on. I thought this was a fascinating discussion, very inspiring. It was an honor to [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2742.1200000000003s)]
*  have you on the show. As you mentioned several times throughout our conversation, we could go [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2747.4s)]
*  for another hour here, another hour there. I hope you'll consider it. I hope we can maybe have you [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2752.2000000000003s)]
*  back on to drill down on some of these topics at a later date. Happy to, Matt. Thanks so much. I [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhTbQy6vf4&t=2756.68s)]
