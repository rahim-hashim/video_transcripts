Video Description: From San Francisco’s Silicon Valley to Tel Aviv’s Silicon Wadi, software business entrepreneur Yochi Slonim made a name for himself in tech hubs around the globe. Notably, he was co-founder of billion-dollar Mercury Interactive, which HP acquired for $4.5 billion, and previous to that a leader at Tecnomatix, which sold to UGS and was acquired by Siemens. Those big deals that came on the heels of several other Yochi Slonim software startups. But Slonim's not in software development anymore. Not for the software industry, anyway. He's now leveraging his tech chops to develop something with far more potential impact: drugs. On this epsiode of the Business of Biotech, we'll learn about his foray into biopharmaceuticals with Anima Biotech, a company he’s been building for the past ten years and which boasts pipeline partnerships with heavyweights Abbvie, Takeda, and Lilly.

# New Apps For AI in mRNA With Anima Biotech's Yochi Slonim
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ)
*  I'm Matt Piller, host of the Business of Biotech podcast, and if you're listening to my voice right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  now but not seeing my face, maybe you haven't heard that we've launched a new Business of Biotech [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=4.64s)]

*  and Watch tab, and choose Business of Biotech in the drop down. Yoki Sloan made a name for himself [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=33.76s)]
*  in global tech hubs around the world, from San Francisco's Silicon Valley to Tel Aviv's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Silicon Wadi. Notably, he was co-founder of Billion Dollar Mercury Interactive, which HP acquired for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  $4.5 billion. Previous to that, a leader at Technomatics, which sold to UGS and eventually [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=55.92s)]
*  was acquired by Siemens. Those were the bigger deals that came on the heels of several other [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=62.0s)]
*  of Yoki Sloan startups. What's all that got to do with the Business of Biotech? I'm Matt Piller, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=68.0s)]
*  this is the Business of Biotech. On today's episode, we are visiting with Yoki to learn about his foray [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=73.84s)]
*  into biopharmaceuticals with Anima Biotech, a company he's been building for the past 10 years. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Anima's approach to tech-enabled drug discovery and development is multi-pronged, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=85.52s)]
*  yielding, as you may have guessed, a target and drug discovery and development platform, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=90.08s)]
*  a handful of partnerships with some very heavy hitters in big buyout, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=95.28s)]
*  and a deep development pipeline of its own. Yoki, welcome to the show. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for having me. It is my pleasure to have you. We're honored. Before we get into the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=104.88s)]
*  Anima story and go too deep into the technologies that you're building, we need to kind of get a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=110.64s)]
*  background on you because as I mentioned in that intro, before you were a biotech entrepreneur, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=115.76s)]
*  you were decidedly a tech entrepreneur, primarily in software. What motivated the move to get into [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=121.12s)]
*  biotech? That's actually a funny story, I would say, and very unconventional because you would [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=128.24s)]
*  expect somebody to sit and plan what they're going to do. Indeed, I built and took public [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=135.28s)]
*  or sold several software companies. The way that this got started, I was working with startup [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=140.96s)]
*  companies as an investor. I was introduced to the technology idea of Anima by my co-founder. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=148.08s)]
*  I became the first investor in the company. I looked at this and he was kind of presenting [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=157.84s)]
*  it to me in a way that appealed to me because my last software company was something that actually [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=164.48s)]
*  I did several software companies in the field of automated software testing and debugging. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=170.88s)]
*  This company was actually quite easy to explain. It was like a black box that you have on the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=179.12s)]
*  airplane that records the flight. When it crashes, you can see what happens. They dig the black box [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=183.44s)]
*  and they investigate and you can hear what happened in the cockpit and see all the different engine [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  conditions. This was actually a black box for software application. It would record everything [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=193.52s)]
*  that happens in the software application and then if something happens wrong, you could go back in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=199.84s)]
*  time and investigate what happened. We were selling this to banks, financial institutions, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=205.44s)]
*  e-commerce sites, all these complex stuff. I sold this company to BMC Software back in 2006. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=211.92s)]
*  I was looking for other stuff to do and then he came to me and he said, you know, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  I have a black box for cells, for biology. It records everything that is happening in the cells [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=226.32s)]
*  and actually it records it in images. You can see the ribosomes making the proteins. The proteins [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  are made from mRNA, which I knew nothing about back then. This is like a processor that executes [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=240.0s)]
*  software code and the mRNA is the software code and the ribosomes run over it and you can see all [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=247.52s)]
*  that in images. This recording is like a black box. Now you can go back and understand why a disease [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  is happening, for example, because the assembly of the protein went wrong. The translation went [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=261.76s)]
*  wrong. This kind of looked to me like a tech company and I asked him, so we are going to build [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=268.0s)]
*  imaging systems over all these cells? Yes, we are going to build it. I had not much other than a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  hunch about it, but I decided to bet on it. I don't even remember why. I became an investor in the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=281.36s)]
*  company and this dragged me down a rabbit hole that was completely unexpected and that became [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  a very long rabbit hole because the timelines, I wasn't aware of the timelines of actually doing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=296.24s)]
*  things, but then I became aware that this technology generates images and tons of them, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=302.16s)]
*  millions of them, and this is like big data. It kind of attracted me that with all my skills in [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=308.88000000000005s)]
*  technology, we could build a platform that would kind of look at all the data and start to analyze [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=317.36s)]
*  it. This was still an academic phase, but it drew me back very strongly into biology, which was a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=323.04s)]
*  challenge by itself, by the way. Real quick, Jovi, just to put a time stamp on this, this was like, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=330.96s)]
*  so ANIMA was founded, I think officially founded in 2014, but this period that you're talking about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=337.2s)]
*  was quite a few years before that, correct? You guys were talking about the foundations of this [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=343.44s)]
*  technology and what year roughly? We are talking about the idea stage, which was my, the initial [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  journey was back then, which led us to the University of Pennsylvania, where we were parked [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=356.0s)]
*  in the academia actually for 10 years. So between 2005, where this was actually invented as an idea, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=362.64s)]
*  until 2014, it was sitting in the academia and the platform technology, so to speak, was developed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=371.6s)]
*  Yeah. And I just wanted to get that specification because it's an important context, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=378.32s)]
*  in the context of this conversation around big data and bio, 2005 was eons ago. That was some [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=384.4s)]
*  early, early days for the concept of big data in biotech. Indeed, indeed. And I was actually [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=391.76s)]
*  involved back then in another aspect of big data, which was super interesting for me, was fintech. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=401.68s)]
*  And fintech was about, let's predict the stock market. It's again, huge, big data, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=407.36s)]
*  and let's see if we can do something with it. So there was no AI, but people were talking already [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=413.6s)]
*  about the early, early, I would say phases of what became machine learning. And they were trying it [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  both algorithmically, but both like, let's do it non-algorithmically. It's kind of seeing the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  conditions and just acting on them based on patterns. So that pattern recognition is the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=432.24s)]
*  beginning of, if you want to say it, AI in many ways, clustering of information, learning from [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=438.96s)]
*  big data, but it wasn't yet AI. But the roots of that, which actually appealed to me, were already, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=447.44s)]
*  as you were saying, back many years ago. Yeah. And at the time, I mean, the technology was cool. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=454.08s)]
*  You were starting to envision some applications for it, but in those years, there was no way, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=461.84s)]
*  probably in the back of your head that you saw, I want to be a drug developer. I want to develop [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=467.2s)]
*  a pipeline of drug candidates. No? So you know, when we took the technology out of the university, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=470.88s)]
*  it was capable of doing in a single cell, in a single experiment, visualize all the mRNA [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=478.88s)]
*  translation events in light pulses. These images were looking like the Milky Way at night, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=488.48s)]
*  with the stars glowing. Wherever proteins were working on the mRNA of interest, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=494.8s)]
*  it was showing light. Whenever they were not doing it, it wasn't. So you could see where, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=500.64s)]
*  when, and how much of a particular mRNA, specific one, is being translated. And I was looking at [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=504.32s)]
*  that, and I don't know why, by the way, because I didn't know much about biology. We'll talk about [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=511.36s)]
*  it later, how I became a biologist down the road. But I actually looked at that and said, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=515.44s)]
*  but this is valuable as an academic tool. If we want to do something with it, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=520.96s)]
*  what it's going to be. And I don't know why, because I didn't even knew back then the words [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=526.72s)]
*  drug discovery. But I said to myself, in every industry, you need to go for the main street, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  not for the side streets to look for the interest and the money. And so I said, maybe this could [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=537.6s)]
*  help us, you know, treat diseases. And then my co-founder, a biologist, and she said, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=544.0s)]
*  well, this is called drug discovery screening. This is what we can do with that. We could actually [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=551.6s)]
*  turn this into a big platform that is looking at millions of these images. And where there is light, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=556.88s)]
*  there is protein being made. We'll be looking for small molecules that are modulating the light. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=564.16s)]
*  If they turn off the light, they kind of inhibit the production of the protein. If they increase [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=569.44s)]
*  the light, they increase the translation of the protein. And I was asking her, I mean, this is [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=575.12s)]
*  something that people are doing. She said, yes, screening, but not like this. This is high content [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  screening at high throughput. We'll need to do deep, deep, deep screening, seeing all these images [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=584.72s)]
*  and doing this over millions and millions of them, over hundreds of thousands of compounds. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  And I don't know how to do that. I said, wait, this level of automation [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=596.24s)]
*  is like tech company. I know how to do that. Let's do that together. You know, it's like the biology [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  essays, seeing the biology with the automation at scale over the big data that is generated. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  This seemed to me like a tech bio, as it is called today. But kind of we were a perfect [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=614.0s)]
*  fit for starting an idea like that. Yeah. You mentioned, I want to get to that part [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=620.16s)]
*  about transitioning and learning, right? The bio aspect. You mentioned, you know, in the beginning, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  being introduced to this technology, not knowing necessarily what a ribosome or RNA was, and then [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  having these conversations with your co-founder. What's her name, by the way? Iris Elroy. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=638.64s)]
*  Iris Elroy. So when you first- She's the chief scientific officer of the company today. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=643.36s)]
*  Mm-hmm. And when you and Iris first started talking about the concept of building a business [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=647.84s)]
*  around this and you were speaking entirely different languages, you hinted just now at [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=653.84s)]
*  the synergies, like, hey, you know, she knows what drug screening looks like and how this might [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  benefit that application. And you know how to make the application. But what were some of maybe the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=662.4s)]
*  more challenging aspects for you in your transition into biotech, learning biology, becoming a [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  biologist, as you said? So first, I understood pretty quickly that I really don't know biology. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=676.96s)]
*  And I decided that this is something that I have to know, but actually I became very interested [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=685.84s)]
*  because, I mean, I was as an investor, as I said, in the company for a while, and then I became the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=691.12s)]
*  chairman of the company and then I became kind of an acting CEO of the company while it's still, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  you know, in process. And I kind of started my journey and I decided that I'm going to do it [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=702.48s)]
*  lightweight. Initially, I was taking courses in biology online, universities, and it kind of [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=707.76s)]
*  became, you know, five courses per year. And now we are talking about several years. So all of a [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=715.36s)]
*  sudden, I was like 25 courses in biology behind me at the time that we are starting the company. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=720.32s)]
*  So I didn't know about how actually it is done in the industry. So a drug screening platform, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=726.88s)]
*  I wasn't aware of that, but I had the tools already to understand what it could do. And, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=734.24s)]
*  you know, the idea of pathways in mRNA biology, what they mean, that we could see them, we could [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=739.12s)]
*  visualize them, we could find compounds that modulate them. Already I had that in mind. So [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=743.92s)]
*  now it connected back to the tech side and I could envision how a large scale, I would say, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=749.44s)]
*  massively parallel automated system could run in a lab and actually do that training and basically [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=756.48s)]
*  analyze all that data. So it kind of was at the right time, you know, coming to me while I [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=764.4000000000001s)]
*  understood already enough biology. I continued to study biology over the years and actually [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  I can interact, I mean, with any biologists from a pharma company and I'm doing this routinely, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=776.24s)]
*  although I usually deal more with the business side right now and the strategy of the company. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=781.28s)]
*  When you started to, I guess, sort of a two-part question. When you started to sort of formulate [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=788.08s)]
*  the concept of the business, right? Like we've got something that we can build a business around. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=794.8s)]
*  We've got a product, right, in development that we can build a business around. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=799.28s)]
*  One, sort of tell me that story. When was the moment where you're like, okay, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=802.7199999999999s)]
*  like this is more than cool technology. We've got something that we can develop into a sellable [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=807.68s)]
*  product. And then two, I guess on the back half of that question, building tech bio teams, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=812.64s)]
*  especially then in the lead up to the launch of the company, it was a new concept in hiring to [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  outfit those teams with talent to this day is a challenge. A lot of companies struggle with [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=829.76s)]
*  the whole brain tech bio kind of approach. So I'm curious about how you built the team. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=836.08s)]
*  So like as a two-part question, there might be a big jump in between the two questions, but one, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=841.6s)]
*  when was the aha moment? We've got something that we can build a company around. And then two, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=847.76s)]
*  how did you go about building the company from an HR standpoint with talent that could meet your [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=851.92s)]
*  needs? So the first one actually was not a singular moment because while we were at the academia, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=857.6s)]
*  we actually ventured out to partner with additional academic institutions. And we actually [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=865.6800000000001s)]
*  strike 17 academic collaborations that led to many publications. So it gave like more and more and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=874.24s)]
*  more, you know, kind of feeling that there is something really here and we should be doing a [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=881.52s)]
*  real company around that technology. It's so unique. So I decided to take the technology out [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=886.8s)]
*  of the university after I saw so many different applications and users, so to speak, that basically [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=892.24s)]
*  had a very limited research license to the very early phase to conduct a single experiment, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=900.8s)]
*  so to speak, okay. And visualize their proteins and mRNAs of interest. And so that kind of occurred [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  to me naturally. I wasn't at a point and say whether it is a company or not. It already kind [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=915.76s)]
*  of transitioned in my mind to what are we going to do with that as a company? And in that meeting [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=921.28s)]
*  where I was kind of introduced, I asked the question, can we do treatments of diseases, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=928.0s)]
*  discovery of drugs? And then I heard that there is this concept of screening and big [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=936.0s)]
*  pharma companies are doing that, but not in that way and not with that technology. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=941.68s)]
*  And it was the how moment for me. Okay, this is big. If we could do this. And then my question was [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=946.8s)]
*  right away, as you were saying about the team, because I built companies in the past and I know [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  that this is extremely critical. There are many good ideas that people come to you with and they [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=957.8399999999999s)]
*  say, I want to do this company. And you think about it, it's a great idea, but not for this team, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=964.0799999999999s)]
*  because they cannot get it off the ground. They don't have the skills. So I was thinking, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=969.3599999999999s)]
*  this is biology, imaging, bioinformatics, a lot of software, big data, data analysis, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=974.24s)]
*  and chemistry eventually. I was not aware of that in the beginning, but we built in-house a lot of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=984.4s)]
*  chemistry. I was initially thinking this we can take from CROs outside and so on. So essentially, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  this is a multidisciplinary team and a hard team to build. So we had actually the biology and the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=995.76s)]
*  image processing covered between the biology's co-founder and an image processing person. And [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1003.8399999999999s)]
*  then I brought all the software people from my previous companies quite easily, actually. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the company's pretty sizable right now. I mean, I didn't take an official cap, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1018.88s)]
*  but I was kind of cruising through the website. You've got a pretty stout team. How many people [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1023.92s)]
*  do you employ at this point? Around 100. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1029.92s)]
*  Around 100, yeah. When you got that team together, the company's humming along, you're developing [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1032.8s)]
*  this technology, demonstrating its value. What's that, I guess, sales proposition? I don't want [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1042.0s)]
*  to say sales in a salesy kind of way, but sort of that value proposition you go to the industry [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1050.64s)]
*  with and you say, AI, our application of AI that gives you valuable, actionable imagery [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1055.0400000000002s)]
*  is better than AI that spits out pros, for instance. Look at that. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1067.76s)]
*  It's like you're kind of asking a question about words and images, and you mentioned AI. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1076.16s)]
*  That's actually an interesting question because we are seeing today AI coming into two different [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1088.5600000000002s)]
*  worlds, the world of words and the world of images. And they actually kind of came onto the scene [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1094.4s)]
*  almost at the same time with generative AI for language and generative AI for images. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1103.92s)]
*  Actually, when you look at it, you could say that so far, and maybe I can explain, I think, why, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1112.96s)]
*  AI is actually better in images than words. The reason that this is the case is that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1123.44s)]
*  you know, actually, humans are like that as well. If you think about it, words are ambiguous. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1129.92s)]
*  Images are just data. It is what you see. Then you come to explain it. Then you need the words. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1134.56s)]
*  Then different people will describe the same image in very different words. So basically, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1141.44s)]
*  if you go and train AI on words, it gets all that ambiguity into it. So you train it on a million [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1147.3600000000001s)]
*  words, and it has millions of ambiguities. If you train it on millions of images, you are just [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1154.96s)]
*  giving it millions of examples of the thing. So actually, if you will actually look at this [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1161.2s)]
*  in the context of applications, for example, if you try to explain what is the difference [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1170.08s)]
*  between a dog and a cat, and put it in language as rules, you will run out of paper space before [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1178.72s)]
*  you figure out that for every one, there is an exception. And you cannot actually say what is [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1189.52s)]
*  the difference. But when you see a dog or a cat, you know the difference. You know if it's a cat [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1195.2s)]
*  or a dog. Now, AI will find it very hard to explain to you the difference between a cat and a dog. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1198.72s)]
*  But give it a million examples of a cat and a dog to a neural network that is seeing those images. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1204.64s)]
*  Give it now the million and 10 image and ask, is it a cat or a dog? It will immediately classify [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1210.3200000000002s)]
*  it correctly. So this is a very robust application of AI. The most robust application of AI actually [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1217.76s)]
*  is the ability to see in an image something and classify it versus it A or B. So it's very [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1225.3600000000001s)]
*  robust. It's very robust. It's very robust. It's very robust. It's very robust. It's very robust. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1232.56s)]
*  Now, why is that even relevant to all we're talking about? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1235.76s)]
*  Yeah, I was thinking that maybe I should have backed up a little bit and said, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1238.8799999999999s)]
*  okay, let's talk about the AI aspect of the Anima solution before we cut into the value of the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1243.52s)]
*  imagery. But yeah, as you were saying. So actually, yes, it's like why do we need AI in biotech? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1249.04s)]
*  Okay, maybe we should even start there. Okay, what's missing? What was not working? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1259.68s)]
*  Well, there's so much discussion around AI and biotech and so many levels of application of AI [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1265.52s)]
*  and biotech that I think there's a lot of misunderstanding out there. Or I don't know [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1272.5600000000002s)]
*  if it's misunderstanding or just a general lack of understanding around the real killer apps, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1276.3200000000002s)]
*  like the real potential of AI. So yeah, this is exactly, I would say that this is, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1282.64s)]
*  this comes to the question of what is AI really good at that we are not. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1290.64s)]
*  Because if you want to bring AI, it has to have some value and there is some something that you [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1296.0800000000002s)]
*  can do that we cannot do. So it is really, when you try to purify this and to understand, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1300.64s)]
*  it's about the ability to make sense of a lot of data. And this is what AI is really good at. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1308.96s)]
*  What people are not good at is when it makes sense of data, we are good at. And AI is actually [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1315.92s)]
*  sometimes struggling to come up with reasoning in quite simple situations. But when it's a lot of [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1323.04s)]
*  data and you try to make sense of it, you can't. So biotech is all about biology and biology is [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  a lot of data. And it's unrelated data that people are trying to connect together. So there are [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1338.6399999999999s)]
*  millions of publications about diseases and proteins and roles and targets and molecules [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  and drugs. And it's extremely challenging just to understand the links between all of these elements. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1349.04s)]
*  And you are biased towards what you know and what you have read. You don't know what you haven't [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1355.52s)]
*  read. So you can now use AI to summarize those things for you and find connections and discover [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1360.1599999999999s)]
*  mechanisms by kind of connecting that if A is related to B and B affects C and C is a protein [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1366.48s)]
*  that is doing something with D, then there is a connection between A and D. And it's good at [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1373.84s)]
*  doing that. And it summarizes this into knowledge graphs that you can visually see it. And this is [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1379.84s)]
*  actually a powerful way to look and learn about diseases and mechanisms and targets that could be [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1385.2s)]
*  involved in diseases. But notice one thing, okay? And this comes again to the words versus the [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1391.76s)]
*  images. These are words. It is good at connecting the words when there are many, many words, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1397.6s)]
*  but it is starting with the ambiguity that is in the words themselves. So these publications [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1404.8799999999999s)]
*  have ambiguity. The data is incorrect. The assumptions are incorrect. It didn't understand [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1411.52s)]
*  what is being said really. Eventually the conclusions are not what is said in the abstract, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1417.76s)]
*  but the abstract is telling the article. So that's kind of forward-looking statements into what [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1423.36s)]
*  could be done, but the experiment didn't prove it. And everybody is citing it back there afterwards [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1431.44s)]
*  as something of effect. So AI actually is good in images. And images are a completely different [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1436.48s)]
*  way to approach the whole problem. So if you're looking at experiments, all these publications, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1447.36s)]
*  by the way, are post-after-the-fact summaries of priorly done experiments. But those are very biased [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1452.24s)]
*  because of the words and because of the connections. So each of them may be good, but many of them are [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1460.8s)]
*  not. And then the connections are wrong. Now imagine that you could do it in a completely [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1465.04s)]
*  different way. And this comes actually later to what we have done also at Animo. If you are [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1469.9199999999998s)]
*  doing an experiment and you image it in images from inside the cells looking at the biology at [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1476.24s)]
*  play, you are basically observing the real biology. And the most experiments really, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1482.32s)]
*  those in publications, for example, they are measuring one parameter. But if you could actually [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1487.84s)]
*  visualize an image, just like we people visualize a cat or a dog, we visualize it once, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1493.68s)]
*  a thousand parameters, a hundred thousand parameters. We cannot then say what the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1500.16s)]
*  parameters are. We don't think like that. We just visualize it. So imagine that you could generate [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1503.76s)]
*  millions of visualizations, for example, a disease like Alzheimer's. You take and you visualize [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1509.52s)]
*  a hundred million cells in parallel at once, automatically cells that are diseased and cells [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1516.4s)]
*  that are healthy. And now you give it to a neural network with AI to look at that and say, what is [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1524.8799999999999s)]
*  the difference? Now it will not tell you the difference in words, but it will understand the [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1531.52s)]
*  difference just like the dog and the cat. It doesn't explain what are the rules, but it knows now if they [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1537.92s)]
*  see a cell, is it diseased or healthy? Now this is huge because now if you can actually have the [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1543.36s)]
*  technology that is seeing, as we are seeing, the real biology pathways, for example, in mRNA biology, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1551.44s)]
*  now you could go back to that knowledge graph, so to speak. Now you're asking AI a much better [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1559.76s)]
*  question. You're telling him the difference in Alzheimer's disease between healthy and diseased [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1565.84s)]
*  cells based on a hundred million examples that I've seen is this pathway. Go and figure out for me [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1571.12s)]
*  now with your abilities, what are all the proteins along this pathway? Is any of them known to be [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1577.76s)]
*  associated with Alzheimer's? And now we are really into understanding the disease mechanism. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1584.88s)]
*  But AI is more helpful actually if you give it real data, unbiased data, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1592.0800000000002s)]
*  a hundred million examples of it. This is where the real power of AI comes to play and shines at [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1598.8000000000002s)]
*  best. Yeah, yeah, and I don't want to come off as sophomoric here, Yoki, but the skeptic. I'm going [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1605.68s)]
*  to throw a skeptics, I guess, perspective at you. We've played with AI imagery here in the office a [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1611.92s)]
*  bit. Consumer grade, right? So this is where I'm going to ask you for some differentiation [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1622.0800000000002s)]
*  because the perception among perhaps many of our listeners who have only had that kind of [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1628.24s)]
*  consumer grade interaction with chat GPT or whatever other image-based AI tools are out there [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1633.3600000000001s)]
*  on Google is like, I'm not so sure about the accuracy of the data because when I ask it to [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1639.52s)]
*  create a picture of a woman sitting on a chair, oftentimes the chair has five legs and woman has [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1646.24s)]
*  six fingers on one hand. So we look at that and we go, well, I don't know if AI is that good at [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1651.92s)]
*  imagery. What's the difference here between the applications that you guys are building and they [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1658.1599999999999s)]
*  ensure, I guess, your assuredness around the accuracy of the tool in your application versus [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1663.2s)]
*  what so many see from sort of a consumer level? Well, actually what consumers see today, there are [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1673.04s)]
*  two things. One of them is generative AI for images. And indeed, this is the ability to create [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1678.96s)]
*  an image that is a new image. And those images can be stunning, but as you said, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1688.72s)]
*  in the little details, it could miss. But actually I'm not talking about generating images by AI. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1694.88s)]
*  I am actually talking about image understanding by AI, given an image that is the real image. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1702.24s)]
*  It's not an image that AI generated. For example, Tesla is already [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1711.04s)]
*  offering self-driving vehicles. How does that work? And this is working. This is the most robust [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1719.36s)]
*  application actually of AI out there. And it has been working for a while because it comes back to [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1726.08s)]
*  something that the AI is really, really good at. Tesla has cameras that were on the cars driving [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1733.2s)]
*  for a couple of years on 10,000 vehicles and taking videos, which are broken into images, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1740.64s)]
*  of what roads and driving looks like. This is a stoplight. This is a road. This is a car. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1748.24s)]
*  This is a person. This is a tree. This is a sign. This is that. You're seeing millions of examples [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1754.72s)]
*  of that. And then it becomes so much information and so many examples that it can actually drive [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1760.5600000000002s)]
*  in real time and knowing what's around. I'm talking about something that is extremely simpler [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1768.96s)]
*  than that even, which is let's look at 150 million images taken from cells of a disease model. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1774.88s)]
*  Now these are real images that indeed we take with our imaging technology, but they are the ability [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1784.72s)]
*  to see and visualize the actual biology. It's not generated by AI. It's just taken with a microscope. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1790.8s)]
*  It's a high-powered microscope that runs in an automated lab and takes 150 million images from [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1798.96s)]
*  all of these single cells. So the data is there. This is the biology. Now we apply image classification [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1805.68s)]
*  and understanding on top of it, just like the cats and the dogs. It's a completely different paradigm. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1812.8s)]
*  I'm curious as you describe this, and I'm understanding the value of that visualization [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1821.1200000000001s)]
*  of actual cells. There's no room for ambiguity. There's no room for interpretation that you get [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1826.96s)]
*  with the written word. There's really no, not even like a sort of a time parameter that skews [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1833.68s)]
*  the data because it's just real. It's potentially real time, I would assume. I mean, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1842.56s)]
*  the time factor is yet to take it off the table. What does the translation of the machine's [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1848.48s)]
*  understanding of what it's seeing to the human being who can do something about it look like? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1856.0s)]
*  Does it remain visual through the application state or is it subject to analysis in a visual [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1862.8s)]
*  form and then decisions are made based on that visual analysis? I guess I'm wondering what the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1873.04s)]
*  action point is at the end of the process. So let me describe to you our platform and how it [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1878.96s)]
*  is applied because this is essentially how we are connecting all of these things together and where [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1887.2s)]
*  basically we are bringing it to have value. Really in a nutshell, our platform, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1893.3600000000001s)]
*  it's called mRNA Lightning. mRNA Lightning platform visualizes and decodes the mRNA [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1902.8s)]
*  lifecycle and is used in multiple applications of drugs and target discovery, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1910.24s)]
*  RNA drug optimization, mRNA vaccines optimization, anything that relates essentially to, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1916.72s)]
*  I would say, drugs and vaccines in mRNA, which is a particular specific area in biology but an [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1925.2s)]
*  extremely promising one and a very big one, as we've seen with COVID, for example. So we have [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1934.0s)]
*  really an automated mRNA visualization screening technology. We generated over the last decade more [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1940.96s)]
*  than two billion images of mRNA biology. This was done in dozens of diseases, cell types, condition, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1948.16s)]
*  and we use this massive data set to train disease-specific, what we call AI imaging neural [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1955.92s)]
*  networks. And they are capable of recognizing what we are calling disease signatures. This is really [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1966.48s)]
*  the difference between diseased and healthy cells in a disease. And it's a particular mRNA [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1974.16s)]
*  biology pathway because the visualization technology enables us to take 50 different [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1982.4s)]
*  visualizations in each cell. Each of them is a pathway in mRNA biology regulation. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1988.8000000000002s)]
*  So it's something super important in the regulation of the mRNA. Now, what happens now is that once [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=1996.5600000000002s)]
*  the differentiation between healthy state and diseased state is kind of seen in 150 million images, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2004.48s)]
*  the AI neural network kind of extracts the disease signature, that pathway out of it. It tells you, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2016.24s)]
*  this is the difference. And this is actually a huge step towards answering the biggest question of all, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2025.52s)]
*  why is the disease happening in the first place? What's the disease mechanism? What's the underlying [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2030.88s)]
*  disease mechanism? So essentially now, after the screening phase and the generation of the deep [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2035.8400000000001s)]
*  data in images, you have an image bank that is almost like the disease atlas, if you want to [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2045.8400000000001s)]
*  call it like that. It shows you why the disease is different from healthy state. However, you want [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2053.76s)]
*  to actually do something about it. So this is where the AI analysis of the massive data set [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2060.56s)]
*  actually comes into play and turns it into numbers. It quantifies everything for you, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2065.6s)]
*  and it analyzes it and it suggests novel targets. And it enables you to get started with the next [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2073.84s)]
*  phase, which is screening for compounds that would modulate exactly that pathway and will identify [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2081.2799999999997s)]
*  for you a drug, basically. So it's a drug and target discovery platform. In the same way, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2088.08s)]
*  and by the way, this data that is generated and gives you unparalleled insight into the disease [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2095.04s)]
*  mechanisms, and it aids you in optimization of drugs and discovery and prioritization of targets, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2101.68s)]
*  the words are coming now back. The world is coming back because into the system, we're plugged in [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2108.96s)]
*  a large language model, which is the mRNA Lightning LLM. Now, we are not in the business [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2116.24s)]
*  of developing LLMs. Nobody is, other than a few companies in the world. But you can bring them in [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2121.52s)]
*  if you have data that is robust, that is unambiguous, they will be actually very good at that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2127.68s)]
*  So we are bringing in LLM and we've built a chat-based interface through chat GPT, which we call [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2134.4799999999996s)]
*  the mRNA Lightning Co-Pilot of the system. And you can interact with the data in natural language. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2140.48s)]
*  And all these analysis screens and all the information is actually presented by the system. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2147.92s)]
*  So it's an automated screening now of compounds, follows, and we identify hits, compounds that [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2155.6s)]
*  modulate this, and then we optimize them. So it's a full-scale drug discovery and optimization [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2162.4s)]
*  platform. More recently, we developed applications that are for vaccine optimization, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2168.8s)]
*  for RNAI drugs, SIRNA, ASO optimization. And all this platform really runs in a massively [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2174.6400000000003s)]
*  parallel automated lab architecture. And the screening is really high content, but it's done [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2185.36s)]
*  in high throughput, like huge data that is generated. And it's finally also an open system. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2191.76s)]
*  So you can extract all the data to other AI analysis tools in case that our analysis, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2199.1200000000003s)]
*  for whatever reason, is not what you want. You mentioned the vaccine and RNA therapeutic [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2205.28s)]
*  optimization additions that are more recent. When you began, I'm just wondering, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2214.5600000000004s)]
*  sort of like your, I guess, your strategy or your approach around the development of the [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2219.6s)]
*  platform itself. And you start out, you're like, hey, we could use this. This is a great tool for [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2225.8399999999997s)]
*  target discovery or a great tool for molecular discovery, small molecule drug discovery. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2231.92s)]
*  Did the additional applications kind of unfold as you saw the technology having a fit there, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2238.88s)]
*  or are those things that you thought, well, we need to go chase that down because our mRNA vaccines [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2246.32s)]
*  are a big market opportunity and we need to make our application work there? How did that [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2252.7200000000003s)]
*  evolution of the platform happen? So I'm actually looking at things from my previous companies. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2257.6000000000004s)]
*  And there are two things. One is a product, which most people are focused on, and the other one is [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2269.7599999999998s)]
*  a market, which most people forget about. So it's so much harder to succeed in a company [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2277.2s)]
*  where there is no market for what you're doing than to succeed with a product when there is a [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2284.64s)]
*  market, even if your product is not so good. And our product excels, and we started it, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2290.16s)]
*  in small molecule drug discovery, that screening of compounds that basically [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2298.16s)]
*  are modifying the image as they are in the cells. You kind of turn it into a massive, massive, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2304.32s)]
*  unbiased drug discovery screening campaign by taking, let's say, 300,000 molecules. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2312.72s)]
*  And each of these, when they're in the cells, if they do something to the mRNA biology, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2320.16s)]
*  they will change the image. And now we are back to the dogs and the cats, but now we are looking [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2325.6s)]
*  for a molecule that will make the image look more like a dog and less like a cat. So the hits are [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2331.2799999999997s)]
*  those that are modifying the images from the diseased to the healthy. And the AI has a neural [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2337.6s)]
*  network that can tell, given an image, what it looks like more. So it flags for you those that [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2345.04s)]
*  are active on the mRNA biology pathway. So you know that you've got a compound that is active. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2350.4s)]
*  You even know already almost where it is working. And this is huge. Maybe we'll get to that later [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2356.8s)]
*  about the mechanism of action. Usually that's an after-the-fact, hard and mostly not successful, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2363.12s)]
*  unsuccessful challenge. Here, you can get it even before you start. It's just unguided to it. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2370.4s)]
*  So when I looked at this, I said, okay, we've got this working. We did three partnerships with big [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2377.2s)]
*  pharma companies, Lilly, Tequeda, and ABVY. We've got that application fully figured out, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2382.56s)]
*  and we are developing a pipeline of our own. And I was around presenting the story, talking about it. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2389.3599999999997s)]
*  And all of a sudden, I start to hear people coming to me. And they say, well, we are in mRNA vaccines. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2395.04s)]
*  And if we could visualize the vaccine, which is an mRNA, inside the cells with your technology, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2404.64s)]
*  we could actually profile 200,000 different designs. And you can actually visualize [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2413.7599999999998s)]
*  which one looks better. Now, and I ask them, what does it mean look better? In my terminology, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2422.08s)]
*  healthy and diseased. You know, I'm moving from disease to healthy, but here is a vaccine. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2428.24s)]
*  And they're all the same cells. They say, no, healthy and diseased, switch them for less [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2433.68s)]
*  efficacy, more efficacy. So we want the vaccines that are translating the most protein and in the [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2440.0s)]
*  right place. And we want if, so could you actually find, you know, for us by comparing all of them, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  which ones look the best? So let's throw 200,000 into your system, massively parallel environment [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2455.2s)]
*  like this. You screen them, you come back with 10,000, with 100,000 or 50,000, 40,000, whatever [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2461.76s)]
*  the screening success rate is. It will usually be like 20 to one reduction right away. And then you [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2468.4s)]
*  throw them back and you say, okay, permutate a little bit about those, bring them back for [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2474.2400000000002s)]
*  a second optimization run. And now you will have maybe only, you know, 2000. And every time we [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2478.88s)]
*  visualize and compare and it's a race between the vaccines. You know, consider this is the same [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2486.64s)]
*  thing, actually. It's the same technology applied to a different problem. Now, siRNA drugs have this [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2492.3199999999997s)]
*  problem, which is the endosomal escape challenge. 99% of the siRNA actually gets trapped in there [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2499.2s)]
*  and never gets into the cytoplasm of the cell. But we see it, we see where it is. So we could do [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2509.04s)]
*  things, you know, that modify and enable you to choose those that are actually best in doing that. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2515.52s)]
*  So again, it's the same stuff. So if you have a machine like that, a machine, it's not a machine, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2522.24s)]
*  it's an architecture, a platform like that, and it can visualize the biology inside cells, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2527.52s)]
*  it's applicable to all these problems. So now we are interacting as potential partners with [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  companies that are coming from vaccines and siRNA drugs. And we are exploring, you know, the value [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2537.92s)]
*  of the technology in partnership mode. We are not going to develop those, but we are going to offer [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2544.96s)]
*  the technology for those problems. Yeah, very cool. You mentioned MOA, and I do have a specific [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2550.56s)]
*  question about that because, I mean, as you know, plenty of drugs get approved and go to market. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2557.68s)]
*  There are drugs that have been in the market and in patients for years and years and years, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2564.7200000000003s)]
*  where we still don't have a thorough understanding of that drug's mechanism of action. We know it's [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2570.0s)]
*  safe, we know it's effective, you know, name your drug. So why is it important now? Like, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2575.2s)]
*  give us some perspective on why this advantage of your platform that gives you early access to [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2580.48s)]
*  an understanding of mechanism of action, why is that important now when we've kind of been [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2586.96s)]
*  living blissfully ignorant of so many mechanisms of action for as long as we have? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2592.0s)]
*  Yeah. So indeed, indeed, about half of the drugs that have been approved were approved [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2596.88s)]
*  without an understanding of the mechanism of action. But this is the old, I would say, game. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2604.4s)]
*  Right now, if you speak with a pharmaceutical company and you've got a compound, and it's a [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2611.84s)]
*  great compound, but you don't know how it's working, then unless you go all the way to clinical trials [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2619.6s)]
*  and validate that it's safe and the efficacy is there, they will not want to touch it. So, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2625.92s)]
*  and the reason is that the side effects of that compound could be that it touches upon targets [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2631.92s)]
*  that are bad targets that have failed already in the clinic. So the idea is this. Yes, if you have [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2642.48s)]
*  the money and you want to go by yourself all the way to do all the clinical trials and only there, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2648.96s)]
*  you will find out, or maybe you don't have to find out. It's just a matter of spending so much money [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2654.88s)]
*  and maybe you could avoid it if you knew the mechanism of action. Because if the mechanism [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2661.52s)]
*  of action is going through certain proteins, kinase, for example, that has multiple functions, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2666.48s)]
*  and your drug is hitting that kinase as a side effect that you are not aware of, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2674.64s)]
*  that's like already known to be downstream big problem, and they will avoid the project altogether. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2679.52s)]
*  So I've seen that pharmas are actually very, very sensitive to know the mechanism of action [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2686.32s)]
*  and the target before they will actually invest to go to the clinic with the product. You can [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2692.16s)]
*  develop them all the way to pre-clinical and not know it, but it is hard today to convince people [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  to go for a project without the mechanism of action, and it forces you to go into the clinic [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2704.48s)]
*  almost on your own. And this is a very expensive proposition, especially if you have a broad [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2710.88s)]
*  pipeline. However, if you look at what is happening today with technology, that's a very, very [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2715.84s)]
*  challenging problem. Given a molecule, how does it actually do its magic? It's a harder problem [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2723.92s)]
*  than fighting the molecule. And how do you solve that? So we used to solve it by a technology that [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2731.68s)]
*  we introduced three years ago called MOAI, mechanism of action with AI, which was kind of taking [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2739.68s)]
*  a backward look. Here's the molecule, here's the data that we had before during the screening, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2748.16s)]
*  tried to figure that out for me. But that's really challenging still, even for us. I mean, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2754.32s)]
*  we had great success with it, and I would say five out of eight projects in the last three years, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2761.04s)]
*  we've done it successfully. That's 10 times better than the success rate of the industry already. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2770.7200000000003s)]
*  But what we are doing now with the neural networks and the ability to actually see [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2776.2400000000002s)]
*  right from the beginning, what is the pathway that is different between the healthy and the [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2780.8s)]
*  diseased cells? It's like already knowing the MOA almost, you are there in the neighborhood [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2785.36s)]
*  of the target. That's a game changer. That's turning the pyramid on its head. It's not starting [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2791.52s)]
*  the project and hoping to find the MOA in the beginning. It's starting the project, understanding [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2797.6000000000004s)]
*  what you're going to target, and then actually screening from there. So it's really an interesting [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2803.92s)]
*  proposition. Now you can do this as some companies are trying with words, as we said, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2809.84s)]
*  looking at the publications, looking at the disease, what is known, come up with ideas for targets. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2815.84s)]
*  I think that our approach, which is unbiasedly just looking at the biology, give the AI 100 million [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2821.76s)]
*  examples, it will tell you the pathway. Now go with that pathway to the NLM and ask it what it [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2828.0s)]
*  knows from publications about it. That's a much more powerful approach in our opinion. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2834.96s)]
*  Yeah, and that approach, so if a listener tuned into this episode, I don't know, 30 minutes ago, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2842.32s)]
*  missed my preamble, but tuned in 30 minutes ago and heard this conversation, they would think [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2849.52s)]
*  that I was having a conversation with a technology platform, a drug discovery platform developer. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2854.88s)]
*  And you are the discovery target, optimization. But at the same time, you're developing drugs. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2861.8399999999997s)]
*  The more I talk to you, the more I wonder why. You've got this platform that does [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2870.7999999999997s)]
*  amazing things. You've got partnerships with BigBio who are leveraging the platform to enable their [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2875.3599999999997s)]
*  own discovery and understanding efforts. You've had great partnerships with academia on the [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2881.2s)]
*  technology itself. Why not just go to market with the technology itself, offer it as a service, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2887.84s)]
*  and let other people do the drug development? Why did you build a pipeline? Or why are you building, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2894.6400000000003s)]
*  I should say, a pipeline? You know, that's actually a dilemma that every platform technology company [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2900.48s)]
*  has. And the way that it starts is that if you come with the technology and you talk about the [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2909.92s)]
*  promise of that technology to Pharma, it's going to be very, very hard sell because they ask you, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2917.68s)]
*  did you find something? Did you discover something with your technology? Has anybody else done that? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2925.12s)]
*  So either you show that you're doing it or you show another partner that has done it or several [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2931.3599999999997s)]
*  of them. So we had to develop a pipeline first to prove that it works to ourselves. Second, to prove [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2937.9199999999996s)]
*  to partners that it works. Third, because there is value in those molecules and we were able to fund [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2945.52s)]
*  the development, you know, it's kind of feeding each other. You develop your own pipeline, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2952.0s)]
*  you use your platform, you understand how your partners would be using it as well. You fix things, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2956.96s)]
*  you improve things, you test it. So you're using your pipeline as the way to advance your platform [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2962.96s)]
*  and you use your platform as the way to advance your pipeline. But if you ask me what the next step is, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2968.48s)]
*  that's the inflection point that you need to take a decision because if you want to go, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2974.8s)]
*  you know, to the clinic and we are pretty close already there. So then it becomes a decision, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2978.6400000000003s)]
*  how do you continue to become both? And this is the decision that we are thinking about. We are [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2987.2000000000003s)]
*  actually, you know, by the end of maybe of this year or early next year, we're there. And it requires [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=2992.48s)]
*  a different, you know, maybe thinking about it. But we are seeing so much interest in the platform [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3000.56s)]
*  right now. AI for mRNA biology is unique. We are, by the way, the only company, we've been in a peer [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3005.7599999999998s)]
*  group of 32 companies in small molecule mRNA drugs. Go and find another one that has an AI story to [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3012.96s)]
*  tell. So we were from the very beginning very different, but we were in a place where we were [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3020.4s)]
*  looking similar. And now we kind of diverged from that peer group altogether. And we are [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3028.48s)]
*  really showing, you know, why the platform is so different because it's really an AI tech biopl [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3034.72s)]
*  platform on the basis of that rich deep data that is generated from millions of images, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3040.84s)]
*  completely different from the target based approaches of designing molecules to bind into [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3048.4s)]
*  mRNAs or affect its biology in a certain way. It's a different idea, different concept. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3054.32s)]
*  And now we are seeing that it's much bigger than we thought even it's not even just limited to that. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3060.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, mRNA, small molecule drugs, it's so much bigger than that. So all this strategic [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3066.48s)]
*  thinking is actually happening and is driven by a pull from the market, less than a push, you know, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3071.6000000000004s)]
*  by us. And it's a good place to be. And actually, I like this in kind of interaction. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3077.36s)]
*  Do you think that, is there a chance that should the pull lead you down that clinical path? Like [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3083.12s)]
*  as a businessman, as a man in charge of the company's direction, should the therapeutic [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3091.44s)]
*  pull lead you toward that clinical path? Could you see Adama becoming a clinical grade, you know, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3101.44s)]
*  a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company? Or do you think that'll be something that you'd [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3108.0s)]
*  probably partner out? I mean, maybe it's too early to tell. I'm not asking you know, you don't have [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3112.0s)]
*  to answer the question if you're not prepared to or able to. The answer is that so far, so far [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3115.76s)]
*  we've been under the assumption that the answer is yes. Okay, and we were able to do both. We're [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3123.84s)]
*  able to partner. We've done three big partnerships in our, I mean, in our space, by the way, where [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3128.96s)]
*  we started and as I said, there are over 30 companies there. Actually, there were not so [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3135.6s)]
*  many deals done. We've done three. There is one company that did actually five and then the next [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3140.24s)]
*  two companies did two, about five did one and all the rest never done a single deal. So it tells you [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3146.24s)]
*  that the field is very much in the beginning, you know, in the early phases and the farmers are still [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3151.9199999999996s)]
*  looking at it, kind of, you know, learning and trying, but there are no like, it's not like [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3158.7999999999997s)]
*  completely all over the place and everybody's looking for it. At the same time, if you think [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3164.88s)]
*  about it, mRNA is in the market. Vaccines and in RNAi drugs. So to apply our platform to things [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3170.7200000000003s)]
*  that are close to the market or in the market from a business standpoint is, it makes a lot of sense. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3181.52s)]
*  Yeah. But I don't want to develop them. I want to work with my partners there. So I definitely see [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3188.48s)]
*  ANIMA continuing to do partnerships and many of them in many different areas and we are at the same [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3193.2s)]
*  time moving our pipeline forward. It will come to the point of whether we license it out, whether we [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3201.7599999999998s)]
*  are, you know, continuing with certain ones, maybe with spin-off companies like some other companies [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3206.72s)]
*  have done, you know, to take individual assets to the clinic. That's also a possibility. There are [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3212.24s)]
*  many ways to go about it. Yeah. And those partnerships are, as I mentioned from the outset, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3217.52s)]
*  strong. I mean, you've got some, HapVee, Takeda, Lilly, I mean, great, great partnerships. And [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3224.08s)]
*  we're kind of running short on time here, Yoki. So I can't ask you to go into too much depth on [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3229.28s)]
*  how those partnerships came to fruition. But, you know, if you care to share any more detail on [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3234.88s)]
*  the partner, you know, I guess the details behind the partnerships with those three companies. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3242.08s)]
*  They were published, you know, in interest releases and we got from all of them like very big [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3248.4s)]
*  upfronts and milestone payments and research funding. And it's like, you know, those billion [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3253.92s)]
*  dollar plus deals that you hear about is a lot of potential. But for me, what is important is really [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3260.0s)]
*  not all of that because that's just an evidence that someone else is seeing value in your big [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3266.88s)]
*  vision and in your technology approach. Otherwise you don't get, you know, these partners and [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3273.92s)]
*  definitely not at that scale. And I think that there are two things that they're looking for, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3279.12s)]
*  tactical, which is molecules. They're buying mostly molecules and in the environment right now, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3284.0s)]
*  it's all like shopping for molecules. Molecules are cheap. Pharmaceutical companies are loaded [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3290.2400000000002s)]
*  with cash. Biotech companies have problems to raise funding because of lower valuation. So they [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3297.92s)]
*  sell assets and it's kind of a lot of assets for cheaper on the streets. So to do a technology [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3303.36s)]
*  platform deal, it's even harder in an environment like this unless you are really, really valuable [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3310.56s)]
*  because that's like investing at long-term strategic stuff when you can buy with your money, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3315.6s)]
*  something that you can take to the clinic right away. I think that we have that. And I think that [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3321.6s)]
*  our deals were like that. And because of that, because this is strategic, this is transformational [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3326.32s)]
*  AI with mRNA biology, I think that's big. So I'm very motivated to continue to do that. And we're [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3332.88s)]
*  getting all the right signals that there will be more of that nature. Yeah, very good. All right, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3338.7200000000003s)]
*  one last question and then we got to wrap things up. What's the next big thing on Yoki Slonim's [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3344.4s)]
*  flight? Like what's your, you're looking at your, I don't know, next few weeks, next few months, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3350.96s)]
*  like what are you staring out right now? So if you say the next few weeks and next few months, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3357.36s)]
*  it's actually a very short timeframe. Okay. And I know we work in much longer timeframes. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3363.6800000000003s)]
*  That was an unfair question. Let's say quarters. Okay. So we are now in the process of really [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3372.0s)]
*  rolling out the full big vision of our platform, interacting, offering the platform to partners [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3379.44s)]
*  across its different applications. We are building business models that are sometimes different from [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3387.68s)]
*  each other or different applications. We are having so many different conversations right now about [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3394.96s)]
*  that. And many of these are with people that are AI people in those companies. We even have [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3402.24s)]
*  conversations with tech companies, big tech companies like Nvidia, you know, is a big tech [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3409.3599999999997s)]
*  company. I'm not saying specifically we're talking to them, but I'm giving example, Google, Microsoft, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3415.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, these are interested in the data, in the data and the ability to apply AI over data that [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3420.3999999999996s)]
*  is proprietary. It's data that comes from diseases that have never been visualized before. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3428.08s)]
*  Here is a visualization of a healthy and diseased. And what's the difference? Bring AI [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3434.24s)]
*  with all its power to work on that. So we are thinking about all of these things. This is very [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3439.68s)]
*  exciting, very big and very new. And at the same time, we are very, very connected to the reality [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3445.12s)]
*  of running, you know, a tight chip. This is a business that has to continue and has to be [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3450.64s)]
*  careful because times are actually not amazing still, you know, to say the least for biotech [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3455.92s)]
*  companies. So we are well funded. We have the ability with our partners to move forward. We've [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3462.4s)]
*  got, you know, a lot of stuff going on in development. And this is remaining our focus going forward. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3467.12s)]
*  Yeah. Very good. Well, it's a super exciting technology. I mean, if you're thinking about [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3474.0s)]
*  where is the real deal in terms of high tech and biotech, animal biotech is an exemplary. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3479.44s)]
*  Animalbiotech.com. If folks want to learn more. Is that right? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIgqqY3BYQ&t=3486.7200000000003s)]
