Video Description: Mythic Therapeutics Chief Scientific Officer and Co-Founder Brian Fiske, Ph.D. broke some unwritten protocol with his rapid and multifaceted transition from academia to industry. He calls his many, and sometimes concurrent, early experiences as an MIT Ph.D. student, a Flagship Ventures Fellow, a Bain consultant, a hospital researcher, and a biopharma consultant indiciative of a young man who didn't want to make decisions. In retrospect, it looks more like the perfect preparatory mix for a guy who's leading a company with a unique approach to a white-hot ADC (antibody-drug conjugate) therapeutics market. On this epsiode of the Business of Biotech, get to know Brian as we peel back the layers to expose what's fueling the rapid rise of Mythic's ADC candidate in non-small cell lung cancer.

# Accelerating ADCs with Mythic Therapeutics' Brian Fiske, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [May 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54)
*  The business of biotech is produced by LifeScience Connect and its community of learning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=0.0s)]

*  Dr. Brian Fisk wasted no time moving from academia to industry. In fact, his academic and industrial [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=40.08s)]
*  pursuits show quite a bit of overlap. His PhD work on cancer metabolism made immediate impact [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=46.4s)]
*  on the clinical development and ultimate commercialization of at least two drugs. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=53.12s)]
*  Judging by the entrepreneurial decisions he's made since then, he seems intent to double down [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=58.0s)]
*  on those wins with a current focus on antibody drug conjugates. I'm Matt Piller. This is the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=63.2s)]
*  business of biotech, and I'm delighted to bring you Brian Fisk, who now serves as chief scientific [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  officer at Mythic Therapeutics, the company he co-founded in 2016 and one that's currently [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  embarking on a phase one study of its lead ADC in non-small cell lung cancer. Dr. Fisk, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=81.2s)]
*  welcome to the show. Thank you. Delighted to be here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=88.0s)]
*  It's my pleasure to have you. It's great to see you again. Dr. Fisk and I first met [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=91.92s)]
*  at JPM back in January and made plans to get back together and record an episode on what's going on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=96.72s)]
*  at Mythic. So here we go. Before we jump into the Mythic story, Dr. Fisk, I want to get some [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=102.16s)]
*  background on that mention that I made about sort of your overlapping academic and industrial [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=107.2s)]
*  pursuits. It's unique, I think. I mean, I've interviewed hundreds of founders and CEOs of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=113.36s)]
*  small biotechs, and often there's a much more clear line of demarcation between academia and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=119.2s)]
*  industry. You earned your PhD in biology from MIT in 2015 on the heels of a Harvard undergrad in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=126.64s)]
*  biochem. But during and prior to that PhD, you're going to clear this up for me. During and prior [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=134.64s)]
*  to that PhD, you gained experience at Bain, MassGen, Flagship Pioneering, and Agios. Am I [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  pronouncing that correct? Agios Pharmaceuticals? Agios. Agios Pharmaceuticals. So tell us about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=149.76s)]
*  that. Tell us about what looks to me like this pretty unique combination and overlap of academia [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  and industry. Absolutely. Well, you started with undergrad, so maybe we'll go there first. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=163.68s)]
*  Yeah. In undergrad, I studied biochemistry, but also did some work in applied math and economics. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think if you had asked me back then what I wanted to do with my life, it would have varied [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  week to week. And I would have either said, I want to go be a scientist, be a doctor, or do something [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=184.96s)]
*  in business. And I had the opportunity to do an internship after my junior year, ended up at Bain. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=190.8s)]
*  I ended up going to Bain after undergrad. And I think I chose that direction at least initially [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  to go into business, general management consulting, because I wasn't ready to make a decision [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=206.24s)]
*  on those three things. And it seemed like the least committal path. Realized pretty quickly that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=212.0s)]
*  I wanted to go back. I wanted to go back to school and get my PhD in science and take that route. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=220.4s)]
*  And as a step on my way there, I spent a year as a lab tech in my former advisor's lab, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=227.52s)]
*  Dr. David Fisher, who's the head of dermatology at MGH. He's been a fantastic advisor and mentor [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  to me over the years. And yeah, left Bain, left my six figure job there and took a giant celery cut [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=241.44s)]
*  to go schlep tissue samples around MGH and make cell lines. And it was fantastic preparation to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=250.24s)]
*  get my lab feet under me for a year before going to grad school. While I was in grad school, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=258.08s)]
*  I decided to join Matt Vanderheiden's lab. Matt, at the time it was his first year as a professor, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=266.56s)]
*  and I was his first student. So maybe that speaks to some entrepreneurial [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=274.24s)]
*  vision. Starting a new lab in academia is not dissimilar to a startup. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=279.04s)]
*  Yeah. Were you conscious of that when you made that decision and found yourself in that situation? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=283.92s)]
*  Were you conscious of the entrepreneurial parallel or was it just like, hey, this is a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=290.88s)]
*  cool opportunity? And that acknowledgement came later. I think so. I think so. I think you have, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=296.0s)]
*  you know, there's an aspect when you go into a new lab, there's an aspect of focus, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=305.2s)]
*  but also an aspect of flexibility. I mean, in your PhD, you're driving a lot of the work, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=310.24s)]
*  but I think in a new lab, you have a lot more flexibility and a lot more impact on [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=316.08s)]
*  what the rest of the lab is doing because you are the lab to start. So yeah, I think there are a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=320.56s)]
*  lot of parallels and I was probably attracted for the same reason that I'm ending up being a founder [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=327.76s)]
*  at Mythic. Yep. Yeah. All right. So that lab experience, I think, you know, even along with [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  sort of that entrepreneurial exposure of building out a lab that didn't previously exist, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=339.76s)]
*  the result of the work you did in that lab also, if I'm not mistaken, if I'm reading this correctly, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=346.64s)]
*  the work that resulted from that lab work also contributed to, it seems to me, right, the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=352.88s)]
*  acquisition of the taste for drug development in industry. Would you say that's a fair assessment? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=361.44s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. To be clear, I ended up consulting for Agios and so Matt was on [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=369.52s)]
*  Agios' SAB and also contributed to some of the programs there and I had colleagues who were [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=377.28s)]
*  working on projects that were directly related to Agios. I wasn't working on anything like that, but [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=384.88s)]
*  I had a lot of skills in doing so-called hot experiments, radioactive experiments, and doing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=391.12s)]
*  mass spectrometry based metabolomics where I got into some collaborations with Agios and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  essentially ended up consulting with them for two periods. And that was super exciting. That was my [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  first taste of real entrepreneurship where when I did my first stint with them, they were 30 people, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=411.76s)]
*  mostly chemists, working on trying to find the lead drug. And then when I came back a year later, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  they were 130 scientists. They were in phase one. They were seeing some fantastic results for [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=424.23999999999995s)]
*  really sick patients. And it was so amazing to see what had been done in only a year and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  just got really inspired to do something, get involved with something that looked like that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to jump ahead if I got the chronology wrong, but when did flagship come [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=442.88s)]
*  into the picture? Sure. So based on my experience at Agios and again, thinking, gosh, I really want [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=450.8s)]
*  to do something that looks like that, get involved in some way with something that looks like an [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=460.0s)]
*  Agios and ends up having an impact on patients and building a really exciting company. I started to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=465.12s)]
*  reach out to my network because it wasn't clear at that time that academia was going to be the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=471.28s)]
*  right thing for me, the right next step for me. So what would it look like to work in biotech? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=475.67999999999995s)]
*  And the advice that I got was, hey, as a junior person, your career is going to be inflected by [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=482.0s)]
*  how well the company does. So if you show up at a small biotech and this small biotech does super [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  well, you're going to have a ton of opportunities to grow. If you show up at a small biotech and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  it fails, that's okay because you're a junior person and no one's going to blame you for the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=499.44s)]
*  failure of the biotech, but you're going to have to go somewhere else to get those sort of growth [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=504.96s)]
*  opportunities. And so that immediately brought the question to my mind of, okay, how do I find [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=509.04s)]
*  and start figuring out what a great biotech looks like? And people would give me the answer as well, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=516.0s)]
*  you should go talk to the CEO or you should think about the science and whether you think it's going [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=521.12s)]
*  to translate into the clinic. And my answer was, gosh, I don't know how to do any of those things. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=526.8s)]
*  So I got really interested in the question of what makes a really great biotech. And that led me to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=532.64s)]
*  flagship because I felt like flagship was a place where they were creating multiple biotechs in the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=540.0s)]
*  same place at the same time. And that I would get some experience to try to figure out what works [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=545.8399999999999s)]
*  well and what doesn't work well when you go out and start a biotech. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, definitely a good sort of petri dish to play with those concepts of flagship, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=555.36s)]
*  a lot of opportunity for that. You've mentioned though, a couple of times so far in this discussion, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=562.56s)]
*  you've mentioned a couple of points where it sounds like you personally sort of had to pause [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=566.64s)]
*  and think about what you were doing, what you wanted to do next. Like you talked about at Bain, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure just whether or not this is where I want to stay or it took you a while to determine [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=578.88s)]
*  I want to go back to academia. And then you just mentioned at Agios, what's my next step going to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=584.9599999999999s)]
*  be? In those moments, the question I have for you is like in those moments of what's next in your [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=592.56s)]
*  mind, was there ever any sort of anxiety or pressure or was it a little bit more relaxed? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=599.04s)]
*  Like, hey, I've got options. Let me think hard about which options I want. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=606.64s)]
*  Yeah, to be honest, huge anxiety. It's huge pressure, right? I love my parents and they've [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=612.88s)]
*  been a fantastic influence in my life, but my parents thought I was crazy for quitting Bain [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=625.36s)]
*  and going to work as a lab tech. I was qualifying for poverty-related tax credits that year. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=629.52s)]
*  But you had some assurance in your mind anyway that this is part of a step toward a greater plan, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=642.0s)]
*  right? Exactly. Exactly. So I think I've always thought, I tend to think a lot about what is the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=648.24s)]
*  right environment for me to make the biggest contribution that I can to something that inspires [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=656.4000000000001s)]
*  me, right? Whether that's building and to me what inspires me building a company and building a [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=663.7600000000001s)]
*  company that is able to have a really big impact on patients who are sick. Yeah. I can't imagine. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=669.44s)]
*  I have a son who's a freshman in college right now and I'm just sitting here like empathizing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=678.48s)]
*  with your parents. We sent you to MIT for that degree so that you could do what? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=683.12s)]
*  Yes, that's crazy. So I want to get back to flagship. Like I said, I'm a big fan of flagship. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  I've interviewed a ton of their CEOs and founders. And it's interesting, most of the, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=696.88s)]
*  this is maybe just anecdotal observation. I'm not sure if there's anything to talk about here or not, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=704.48s)]
*  but most of the founders and or hired guns that I've interviewed that are with flagship companies [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=708.32s)]
*  now are execs who came from big bio and the stop at flagship has been sort of part of their [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=716.08s)]
*  move into emerging. I haven't had occasion to talk with execs that did time at flagship like [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  early in their career, right? Like coming out of the experiences you came out of. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=733.84s)]
*  Was that unique like to you, to flagship? Was that sort of a unique scenario? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=738.4s)]
*  Great question. So one thing I would note is that flagship has changed over time. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=744.88s)]
*  I can't speak for flagship anymore. Yeah, we're just John. We're just speculating right now. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=751.12s)]
*  There you go. I think flagships undergone a ton of growth and they were growing a lot. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=757.44s)]
*  And when I was there as well, but no, my role was not unique. I was an associate and then a [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=764.24s)]
*  senior associate and they had lots of other associates at the time, I think maybe around [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=772.0s)]
*  10. But I checked a few years later and they might've had 30 or 40. So they have a lot of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=778.24s)]
*  folks who were right out of some sort of grad school, usually PhD, who are working now with [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=786.1600000000001s)]
*  many of those execs who have been in biofarm and they're transitioning back to company creation [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=793.12s)]
*  who work together to get the companies off the ground. Why did you leave flagship? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=801.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So I left flagship with nothing other than the idea that I wanted to start a biotech [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=806.16s)]
*  independently. So part of it was, I'd had two experiences at flagship, co-founding or working [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=817.04s)]
*  on founding companies, creating companies. And I wanted to seize the challenge to see if I could [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  do that independently. And in my vision for what that looked like, I learned things at flagship [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=831.36s)]
*  that were indispensable for founding Mythic, absolutely critical. So flagship was an incredible [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=842.08s)]
*  experience for me in that sense. But my vision for what I wanted to build was a little bit different [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=850.8000000000001s)]
*  than a flagship company. I think at least for the speaking about the time that I was there, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=858.16s)]
*  a lot of flagship companies tend to focus on building a technology first and then thinking [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=863.36s)]
*  about what are the therapeutic applications of that technology. And obviously that's worked out [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=867.92s)]
*  really well sometimes, right? Like Moderna, thank you Moderna for the COVID vaccines. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  But Moderna was originally, I think, spent a lot of time building a technology and that enabled [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  them to go and do that. I think what I was most excited about was building a therapeutics-focused [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=886.4s)]
*  company from the start and that being the primary goal. And yes, it's embodied at Mythic, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=892.24s)]
*  And so at Mythic, yes, we want to use novel technology to make that drug that's going to [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=898.64s)]
*  benefit patients. We know we need to, we want to be doing something different than other companies. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=904.8s)]
*  But the focus at the end of the day is how do we make the best drug we possibly can for those [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=909.1999999999999s)]
*  patients. Yeah. Where did you feel most equipped? And then I'm going to ask, yeah, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=913.68s)]
*  I might as well just throw both parts of the question out now. Where did you feel [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  like most equipped and where did you feel the least equipped in terms of your [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=924.3199999999999s)]
*  body of knowledge, the body of knowledge that would be required to found Mythic? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=929.52s)]
*  I would say, you know, one of the changes right off the bat, and it's a very obvious one, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=935.68s)]
*  you got to be able to bring people on board who are not in the flagship ecosystem. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=946.8s)]
*  You know, when you're at flagship doing company creation, you're bringing in flagship resources, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=954.56s)]
*  you're bringing in people who are in the flagship network, you're bringing in [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=960.72s)]
*  money from the flagship funds, and you're, you know, working with the partners to pitch them [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  and do that. And all of that comes that whole ecosystem obviously has a focus and a certain [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=970.24s)]
*  set of goals, a certain set of things that they're optimizing for. And it is, it's been very [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=978.64s)]
*  successful, but it's very different from the wider universe, right? It's got its own place in the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=984.08s)]
*  wider universe. And so I think learning more about how do investors other than flagship think about [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=989.2s)]
*  investing in a Therapeutics company over different rounds, because you want to make sure you have a [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=997.5200000000001s)]
*  company that's investable at every single stage, thinking about, you know, why would somebody join [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1003.36s)]
*  not a flagship company, but a company that's just, you know, two guys and an idea? And how do you [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1010.4000000000001s)]
*  bring that team together and build culture? And so I think maybe I'll end there. I think the most [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1015.76s)]
*  challenging thing over time has been how do you bring together a team and how do you build a culture [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  that allows you to be successful in the way that you want to be successful? And it's not only building [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1028.0s)]
*  that in the first instance, but also nurturing it and not taking any of that for granted. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1034.4s)]
*  Yeah, I feel incredibly honored to work with my colleagues. I'm incredibly honored that they came [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1041.2s)]
*  to work at a company that I co-founded. And, you know, that's probably been the best part of this [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1044.88s)]
*  whole experience. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so and we'll dig into that here in a minute. I feel like I might [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1051.2s)]
*  have got ahead of my skis a little bit because I want to hear the origin story. And if you're a [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1057.7600000000002s)]
*  listener and you're listening to this point, lest you be misled into thinking like Mythic is just this, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, tiny little startup, like Mythic's making great progress in a hurry. I mean, the company has [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1069.2800000000002s)]
*  become sizable, well funded. We'll get into the details. But, you know, you've done something [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1074.56s)]
*  from nothing in a relatively short period of time. But before we get any further into that, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1080.6399999999999s)]
*  I want to hear about like the two guys and the idea. Yeah, let's do it. So [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1085.6799999999998s)]
*  I co-founded, I left flagship. I had a office mate and fellow flagship associate, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1093.12s)]
*  leave Alex Nichols, who was my co-founder. And after we both left flagship, we decided to team up [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1100.88s)]
*  and start something. And for the first nine months, it was two guys around a living room table. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1109.3600000000001s)]
*  Funny enough, Alex ended up moving in right next to me without even knowing it. It was just a [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1115.92s)]
*  complete accident. And so we somehow convinced our wives to let us not have jobs and just go [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1122.32s)]
*  over to each other's place and sit around the living room table thinking about how to [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1130.72s)]
*  start a biotech. Wow. That's pretty convincing. We'll spend some time offline. Teach me those. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1134.96s)]
*  So here you found yourself with the grace of your wives, your wives graciously giving you [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  the opportunity to sit around and brainstorm for a few months. Where does that even start? Like, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1152.72s)]
*  did one of you have a seed in a science or did one of you have a motivation and a specific [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1159.68s)]
*  indication or did one of you have some semblance of a target idea? Like what was the, I guess, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1164.8s)]
*  nucleus of the conversation? Like where'd you start? Right. Well, this is, and maybe going back [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1169.12s)]
*  to flagship, this is something that flagship had prepared us well for, right? This stage of, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1176.9599999999998s)]
*  what do you do when you're at zero and how do you potentially work, build something on paper and [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  then test, is that going to work or not? I think at a high level, your job as a very early stage [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1193.92s)]
*  entrepreneur who's just starting out is to take bad ideas seriously. And what I mean by that is [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1202.8000000000002s)]
*  before something is a good idea, like a CRISPR or ADCs, for example, but usually before that, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1210.0800000000002s)]
*  the reason why it's so popular in the hot new thing is because before that it was a bad idea. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You know, maybe it was a bad idea because no one thought it would work. Maybe it was a bad [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1221.12s)]
*  idea because no one could do it, right? But it wasn't something, before it was a big thing, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1225.6s)]
*  it was something that in a hot new thing, it was something that not a lot of people were thinking [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1230.56s)]
*  about. And so I think what we did a lot of was the process of thinking about things [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1234.4799999999998s)]
*  that weren't in favor, but trying to find some, trying to understand why people [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1241.36s)]
*  weren't super excited, why they weren't a hot thing already, and then evaluating, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1245.8400000000001s)]
*  well, how could we be part of as a, and build a company that could be part of changing that? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1250.24s)]
*  And that's what we found with ADCs. We became fascinated with ADCs. I think even back in 2017 [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1255.76s)]
*  when we started working on ADCs, you know, the clinical trials, oftentimes, the clinical results [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1261.68s)]
*  were oftentimes nothing to write home about, but they did show that the drug worked. Oftentimes, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1268.5600000000002s)]
*  the typical story would be, let's say, solid tumor indication, 20% response rate, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1274.88s)]
*  but the responders oftentimes were highly concentrated in these patients that expressed [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1280.72s)]
*  very high levels of the target. So what's going on there? Well, eventually we became very excited [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1285.52s)]
*  about that sort of data because it suggested that if you had a patient who could deliver enough ADC [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1292.08s)]
*  to their own tumor by virtue of very high target expression, then they would respond, whereas for [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1299.2s)]
*  even intermediate, especially low-expressing patients, you couldn't get a response because [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1305.68s)]
*  the antibody component of the ADC wasn't efficient enough at delivering the payload to the tumor. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1311.52s)]
*  And so with that realization of what was going on, we thought clinically for a lot of different [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1318.0s)]
*  targets, particularly in solid tumors, plus the fact that the antibody side of the ADC equation [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1322.32s)]
*  hadn't really been looked at very much, we got very excited about, hey, you know, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1328.0s)]
*  here's a field that's a bit out of favor, but by taking a new approach, we might actually unlock [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1333.36s)]
*  something that's holding the entire field back. Was your co-founder a scientist by training as [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1340.88s)]
*  well? Yep. So Alex is a PhD as well. Yeah. Okay. Good. Yeah. It's important context because I [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1348.08s)]
*  envision these conversations where you're having an intellectual discussion about a therapeutic [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1355.36s)]
*  area. If he didn't have chops to understand the conversation, it'd be a difficult one to sell [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1363.6s)]
*  in those early intimate one-to-one conversations. It'd be difficult to get... I guess create an [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1371.84s)]
*  environment where you're both sort of rallying around the same concept. What were the concerns? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1378.8s)]
*  To your point, the ADC space was established but not thriving. ADC's been around for a while, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1386.1599999999999s)]
*  but it certainly wasn't the ADC landscape that we see today back in 2017. So you had a concept that [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1392.6399999999999s)]
*  would change the paradigm, change sort of the status quo of what had been happening in the ADC [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1399.52s)]
*  space. But what were the, I guess maybe red flags? What were some of the concerns that [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1404.56s)]
*  needed to be overcome? To put your stake in the ground and say, yeah, you know what? Let's go [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1411.2s)]
*  try to chase this thing down. Sure. I think there's a general red flag when you're pursuing maybe a [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1418.32s)]
*  contrarian idea in that you're going to have to tell your story in order to make people get it [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1426.96s)]
*  instead of people coming to you and saying, oh, you're an ADC company and it's five years later. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1437.2s)]
*  Of course I would join an ADC company. Of course I would invest in an ADC company. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1441.68s)]
*  So I think generally that's something that we had to overcome. Were you conscious of that from the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1445.6000000000001s)]
*  outset? As you discussed this, the concept where you're like, oh yeah, but boy, I don't know how [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1453.68s)]
*  warm the VC community is going to be if we just pop up and say, hey, you know, these ADCs that [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1461.52s)]
*  people have been struggling with for so long, we think we got to figure it out, give us some money. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1468.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's a great story that our lead investor, Brian Roberts of Enrock tells [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  that when he first did diligence on us for the series A, he called up his oncology experts and [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1481.28s)]
*  they said, ADCs, why are you doing something in ADCs, Brian? This doesn't make any sense. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1487.28s)]
*  Go do cell therapy, go do something else. So it's those sort of reactions, but I think people like [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1494.16s)]
*  Brian were actually able to and willing to listen to what we had to say, which I'm especially [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1499.92s)]
*  appreciative of because we're not the 50 year biopharma veterans coming and saying this is the [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1508.0s)]
*  next thing where the guys who spent two years at flagship coming to tell you, we were in the living [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1512.88s)]
*  room and we thought that this would be a good idea and maybe a little bit of evidence that goes [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1519.2s)]
*  along with that. But yeah, it is something to overcome. On the other hand, I think we're taking [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1523.36s)]
*  such a different approach at Mythic. I still feel like we have convincing to do. I think the [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1532.56s)]
*  ADCs are hot right now, so we're kind of in that category, but we're not a linker payload company. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1538.48s)]
*  And when I think people think of an ADC company, I actually think they're really thinking of a linker [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1544.8s)]
*  payload company. And so I still think we haven't quite hit our hot moment yet. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1548.48s)]
*  So unpack that a little bit, compare and contrast Mythic to the assumed linker payload company, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1554.48s)]
*  like the company that everyone just assumes when they think ADC. What's different about you? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1565.84s)]
*  Right. So maybe as I started to introduce beforehand in this conversation, we focus on the [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1572.24s)]
*  antibody component of the ADC rather than the linker payload component. And we design [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1580.8s)]
*  antibodies that can deliver more of that linker payload, more of that payload really, to cancer [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1587.04s)]
*  cells where you want it and less payload to normal cells where you don't want. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1593.04s)]
*  Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Whereas a lot of, like I was just looking at some ADC companies this morning [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1598.3999999999999s)]
*  in preparation for a project we're working on that's going to show up a little bit later in the year. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1604.56s)]
*  And I found that many of them, like, you know, their antibodies are coming in from an outsource [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1610.24s)]
*  provider. Like, so you're saying like you're doing that antibody development in-house. Is the linker [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1614.8s)]
*  technology then outsourced at Mythic? Yeah. So for our first program, we're using the CMMAE, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1621.44s)]
*  which is a well-known linker payload. Our platform is fundamentally agnostic, right? So we've shown [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1627.92s)]
*  our technology works with the CMMAE. We've shown it works with topoisomerase inhibitor payloads. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1633.68s)]
*  We've shown it works with DNA toxins. So regardless of what we attach to the antibody, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1640.5600000000002s)]
*  it will deliver more. And you're right though, in that, I think the reason why no one is really [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1645.92s)]
*  focused on the antibody up to this point, other than Mythic, is because some of the challenges [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1653.68s)]
*  behind the linker payload historically were so difficult to overcome. And I think having [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1660.0s)]
*  overcome some of those challenges is why the ADC field is experiencing so much success right now. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1664.4s)]
*  But the question is, what's the next generation? What's going to solve the problems that we have [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1671.12s)]
*  now, not the problems that we had 20 years ago? Yeah. Yeah. What are the problems now? Like, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1676.64s)]
*  you know, the problems 20 years ago, you know, I think we could reflect on that toxicity and [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1682.56s)]
*  payload and trying to get the equation right, you know. So assuming that we've gotten to a point [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1687.44s)]
*  where that has been figured out, what challenges do you face now? Like, what are the problems now? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1694.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So one of the most inspiring visions for the field, and it's not necessarily [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1702.8s)]
*  my vision, but I will ascribe to it, is that ADC should replace chemo, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1711.28s)]
*  right? Because there are more efficacy, less toxicity. If you, I mean, just the word chemo, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1718.8799999999999s)]
*  we would try to avoid even using the word chemo in association with what we're doing with ADCs, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1727.12s)]
*  although many of the payloads, you know, technically they are chemo. Just the word [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1732.3999999999999s)]
*  chemo makes you think of, you know, maybe someone who has cancer, who has the potential [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1738.24s)]
*  to get better, but it's not going to be a fun experience, right? Right. So I think that's one [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1743.76s)]
*  of the most inspiring visions. But if we're actually going to do that, we're actually going [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1750.08s)]
*  to replace chemo with ADCs, we're going to have to get ADCs to work for broad segments of patients [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1753.1200000000001s)]
*  and many different targets. And right now we're in a place where, at least in solid tumors, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1760.72s)]
*  ADCs work really well for targets that are very highly expressed. So HER2 in breast cancer and [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1766.4s)]
*  a couple of other cancers, Nectin 4 in bladder cancer, these are very highly expressed targets. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1772.88s)]
*  But where ADCs don't work currently are lower expressed targets, and specifically patients who [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1782.5600000000002s)]
*  have a target, but it isn't expressed at those super high levels. And so being able to treat [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1790.8s)]
*  patients with intermediate levels of expression, low levels of expression, being able to look at [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1796.96s)]
*  targets that don't have, you know, hundreds of thousands of copies per cell, like a HER2 or [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1802.48s)]
*  a Nectin 4, and being able to look at patients who are inherently resistant to the payload, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1808.1599999999999s)]
*  that's really what's going to allow us to replace chemo. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1814.0s)]
*  Yeah. And when you, so back up a few years, when you were, you gave a great example of Brian, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1819.1999999999998s)]
*  you know, one of your lead investors, jumping on board. When you were out there trying to raise [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1829.9199999999998s)]
*  that Series A, and in subsequent fundraising efforts, I'm curious about what were the keys to [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1837.2s)]
*  winning that favor in a market, especially in those early days was, I don't want to say frowned [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1845.92s)]
*  upon, that might be too strong, but certainly not in favor. So what was it sort of your vision for [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1852.72s)]
*  where ADCs go next and the way that you would go about putting them together, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1860.72s)]
*  in the case of like, what were some of the keys to getting, winning that favor of the VC community? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1865.76s)]
*  I think telling a big story really well and very clearly and succinctly, and then not giving up. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1872.96s)]
*  Like, yeah, just trying over and over and over again in the face of [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1886.64s)]
*  failures. I think I've probably been in 500 investor conversations, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1890.08s)]
*  like distinct investor conversations at this point, and only a handful of those were ever yeses. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1896.0s)]
*  Yeah. Did you, this is totally out of left field, just curious though, because you're young and [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1903.12s)]
*  because your co-founder was young as well, like when you guys, you know, you're still young, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1908.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't want to age you, but in 2016, 2017, like, you know, a couple of years experience coming out [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1913.04s)]
*  of your PhD program, did you experience any, I don't know if you'd call it, what would it be [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1917.68s)]
*  called, ageism? If people are like, you're out there doing the surrogate, trying to raise some [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1923.8400000000001s)]
*  money to get a company started and, you know, did you ever get any perception from some of the VCs [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1929.3600000000001s)]
*  that like, who's this kid? Like, what's he looking to do? You know, go around the block a few times [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1935.52s)]
*  and then come back and see me. Yeah, well, during that process, we definitely went around the block [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1940.24s)]
*  many different times. I like how you frame that maybe I'm a little older now, I certainly have a [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1946.72s)]
*  few more gray hairs. Oh, well, yeah, the business will do that too, yeah. It will. Look, I don't [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1952.56s)]
*  know, I can't say, I can imagine, you know, different places, maybe you've gone different [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1960.48s)]
*  ways, maybe people were excited that young folks with our background were trying to do something [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1965.76s)]
*  new, and maybe it made them listen and pay attention to what we were doing. But I'm very [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1970.72s)]
*  thankful for having found people like Brian, like Kareem Helmi at Viking, who's one of our other [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1977.6000000000001s)]
*  lead investors, Dan Farrow at Omics, Josh Koppelman at First Round to start it all off in our seed [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1984.48s)]
*  round, who were willing to listen to what we had to say. And I would also say, you know, a big [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1989.84s)]
*  moment for Mythic was when we raised our angel round. And so it wasn't just me and Alex, it was [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=1998.24s)]
*  me and Alex and a group of angels who, for some unknown reason, you know, well, hopefully for good [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2004.64s)]
*  reasons, you know, that they saw something here that they wanted to invest in Mythic instead of [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2012.4s)]
*  doing anything else they could have done with that money. And so during our angel round, we raised [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2019.28s)]
*  about $750,000 in summer of 2017. And that was about nine different C-level biotech execs. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2024.48s)]
*  And so at that point, again, it wasn't just us, it was us plus these, you know, we're barring the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2034.56s)]
*  credibility and advice of our angel investors in order to, you know, grow and move forward. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2040.48s)]
*  Yep. Yeah. So tell us about what you're putting the money that you've raised to date toward. Tell [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2045.6s)]
*  us a little bit about the clinical program. And or, I mean, you tell me where you want to start. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2052.48s)]
*  You talked about how flagship sort of takes this approach generally around let's build a platform [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2059.76s)]
*  or a technology and then figure out what we do with it from a therapeutic standpoint. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2066.08s)]
*  You kind of took the opposite route, yet you've landed on, you've got a platform, right? I mean, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2071.76s)]
*  the company has a platform now. So I guess tell us a little bit about the build out of that and [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2077.44s)]
*  what it's producing and yeah, the brick and mortar that's put together as a result of your [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2083.92s)]
*  investment success. Sure. So we have built a platform. We've gone very broad with our [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2093.36s)]
*  platform. So we've applied this engineering on the antibody side that allows us to deliver more [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2101.12s)]
*  payload to cancer cells and less to normal cells across about 20 different targets. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2107.12s)]
*  We inserted our engineering into over a hundred different clinical stage ADC antibodies and we're [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2112.08s)]
*  on 10 at a number, I think 16,000 at this point. Wow. Yeah. We've done this a lot and we built a [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2118.56s)]
*  platform and a team that's very good at, you know, doing this very quickly. Out of that effort, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2124.72s)]
*  right? Because I think what we saw was a potential for this type of engineering to result [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2132.72s)]
*  in a therapeutic that would have an impact on these lower expressing, less sensitive patients. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2139.8399999999997s)]
*  We very quickly found where that technology worked really well. And one of those was Met, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2145.9199999999996s)]
*  which is the target of our lead drug. We also found where it didn't work. And I think that's part of, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2152.16s)]
*  you know, in my vision, at least, even if you want to make, that just are interested in making [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2157.8399999999997s)]
*  the drug, if you have some sort of an insight on how to do that, you're never going to avoid a [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2162.56s)]
*  messy car accident between your technology and target biology. Some things science allows them [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2168.48s)]
*  to work, some things it doesn't. And so we went very broad, very early to try to figure that out. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2176.88s)]
*  Where was it working the easiest, the quickest, the fastest, the best? And so that was met, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2183.52s)]
*  at least initially. And so our lead ADC is, it's ADC targeted against Met. It's currently in a [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2189.92s)]
*  phase one dose escalation, dose expansion trial as monotherapy, a non-small cell lung cancer. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2198.2400000000002s)]
*  And we're nearing the tail end of the dose escalation portion. You know, we're working with [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2204.7200000000003s)]
*  a number of sites. And I'm just incredibly grateful to the sites and the patients who have [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2212.1600000000003s)]
*  been on this journey with us so far. Yeah. How big is the company now? I mentioned that your growth [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2218.08s)]
*  was pretty rapid. I mean, once things got rolling, I mean, you've got a pretty sizable outfit now. So [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2223.52s)]
*  how many employees are with Mythic? So we're at about 40 right now. I'm at our world headquarters [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2228.64s)]
*  here in Wolfham. Yep. Yep. Very nice. Just one location to date. Yeah. What are the, I guess, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2236.08s)]
*  intentions? I mean, obviously it's early, you're in phase one, but what are the intentions longer [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2245.6s)]
*  term? And this is the question that I always love to ask because I can always sort of gauge just how [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2251.3599999999997s)]
*  transparent a founder or CEO is in their response to this question. Like, well, you know what? Our [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2258.3199999999997s)]
*  intentions are to build a molecule that is ripe for acquisition or build a molecule that we can [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2265.2799999999997s)]
*  take to a certain point and actively sell or partner, or we want to take this thing to the [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2274.4s)]
*  finish line. We want to build a full service biopharmaceutical company that works in a specific [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2279.92s)]
*  area of indications. And with the caveat that opportunity presents itself and those plans can [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2286.08s)]
*  all change. So I'm not holding anyone to anything, but this is your first go at [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2292.7200000000003s)]
*  at founding a company around a molecule and an idea that you and your co-founder, you know, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  kind of put together on your own. There's gotta be a strong sense of ownership, right? Around what [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2306.88s)]
*  you're doing. I'm sure you've put a lot of time, money, and intellect into it. What would you like [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2313.0400000000004s)]
*  to see happen? Like, let's put it that way. Like, what would you like to see happen with this company? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2319.76s)]
*  Where would you like to take the company? I'd like to see, I'd like to cure some patients, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2323.76s)]
*  or at least make some patients feel a lot better. And it's exciting to be in clinic and doing some [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2331.5200000000004s)]
*  of that right now. But obviously we have to go through a number of stages of development before [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2338.5600000000004s)]
*  we have an even bigger impact. And so where I would want to go with the company is building [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2343.76s)]
*  an enduring multi-product oncology company. You know, we've seen, we've done a lot of engineering [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2350.24s)]
*  like I talked about, and we've seen the impact that this sort of an approach can have. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2359.52s)]
*  We started out with, you know, so-called pH engineering to accomplish this effective more [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2363.52s)]
*  delivery to tumor cells and less delivery to normal cells. But we have subsequent generations [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2370.24s)]
*  of different types of engineering that we can also achieve the same effect and combine it with pH [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2375.52s)]
*  engineering. And so it's great to have a lead program, but we'll have, we're building a pipeline [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2379.44s)]
*  behind that. We have a second program, which will come to start I&D enabling work this year [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2386.7200000000003s)]
*  for a potential I&D file at the end of next year. And so building an enduring multi-product oncology [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2391.84s)]
*  company that can have the full impact of what we've discovered with our technology and our approach. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2399.44s)]
*  Yeah, that technology, the discovery, I mean, you met, you know, 16,000 iterations, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2406.48s)]
*  right now one clinical candidate. You know, someone who isn't like intimately familiar with the way [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2413.92s)]
*  that this business works and discovery works, but look at it and go, you know, if I made 16,000 [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2420.0s)]
*  widgets today, and none of them were quite right and walked out with one, that'd be a pretty [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2426.96s)]
*  frustrating experience. And this is going to lead back to, I mean, and obviously most of our [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2432.96s)]
*  audience understands how this business works. But at the same time, you build an organization, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2437.52s)]
*  you know, 40 people now, 40 people and growing, plus partners and, you know, manufacturing partners. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2443.92s)]
*  And you mentioned this earlier, you know, the culture at Meth-Vec, you know, the team and [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2452.2400000000002s)]
*  sort of the mission. It can be a frustrating industry to work in if you don't embrace [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2457.12s)]
*  those odds and that, you know, quote unquote failure rate. So share with me a little bit [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2464.96s)]
*  about that. You know, it's a young company led by young people. You've built this organization. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2470.88s)]
*  It's a tough business to be in. What does Brian Fisk do to maintain, to build and maintain a [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2479.2s)]
*  culture of, you know, positivity and momentum and excitement about what you guys are doing there? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2486.64s)]
*  So first off, it's the amount of work required to do, you know, numbers one through 15,999. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2494.48s)]
*  This is far less than the work that's required to take one into clinic. And so I guess that's [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2505.44s)]
*  the first thing that I would say we're fortunate to have been able to build a platform where [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2511.6s)]
*  it doesn't cost us much to do multiple cycles of iteration with hundreds and hundreds of candidates, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2518.64s)]
*  thousands of candidates on any given program. And we keep a very high bar for what we take [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2524.4s)]
*  into clinic. Essentially, it's got to be best in class, it's got to be treating some very sick [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2531.92s)]
*  patients of whom there are a lot of them in order for us to get motivated to bring something into [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2539.36s)]
*  clinic. And I think that's very motivating for people. One of the, and we've talked about it [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2544.96s)]
*  before in general terms, but one of our core values in Mythic is what we call patient centered science [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2552.56s)]
*  in that we get really excited about science that's going to have an impact in patients and letting [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2557.6s)]
*  that impact in patients lead like what that drug looks like and the effect it's going to have [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2563.92s)]
*  lead us to what sort of technologies would we have to do in order to accomplish that rather [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2568.24s)]
*  than the other way around. And I think that's been very motivating to a lot of folks. A lot of folks [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2572.4s)]
*  have come to us, come to work with us from other companies where maybe they had a really exciting [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2577.8399999999997s)]
*  technology, but it never really translated into a drug that had an impact on patients. And so [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2583.8399999999997s)]
*  that's not everybody. Some people like to work on technology. Some people like to [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2592.24s)]
*  do other things, but that's the folks that we've attracted at Mythic. And so keeping that really [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2596.7200000000003s)]
*  high bar, being really sure that we are giving ourselves the best shot possible to have something [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2601.6000000000004s)]
*  that could really impact patients. When we make that decision to put something into [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2608.32s)]
*  IND enabling studies, that's been a core part of who we are. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2612.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Very good. You mentioned 40 employees. I said 40 employees and growing. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2617.36s)]
*  That growth was recently marked by the addition of a new CEO. Yeah. So tell me a little bit about [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2624.1600000000003s)]
*  that. What went into the determination that you needed a new CEO? Was there any sort of [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2632.8s)]
*  an inflection point around that hire? And tell me about the hire itself. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2638.6400000000003s)]
*  Sure. So we're incredibly excited to be working with George. So George Eliadis joined us from [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2643.2000000000003s)]
*  Jazz. He was formerly chief transformation officer and head of business development at [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2649.12s)]
*  Jazz. Brings a ton of experience in commercial launch, M&A, product strategy, et cetera. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2654.48s)]
*  So I think he's the right CEO to take what we have, which is some interesting proof of [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2665.2s)]
*  concept in a platform and scale that into multi-product enduring oncology company. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2671.3599999999997s)]
*  And yes, maybe I said he'll be leading the team to do that. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2677.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely leading the team. I mean, this is interesting to me as well. You're [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2686.64s)]
*  the chief scientific officer? Chief science officer. Scientific or science? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2691.28s)]
*  Scientific. Scientific. Okay. I don't know if there's anything different between those two [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2696.4s)]
*  words if it's just semantics. But you're the founder and chief scientific officer. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2703.52s)]
*  What kind of goes into the thinking around that? You've got two founders. You say, okay, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2710.24s)]
*  we're going to form up a company. You just hired a CEO who you think is going to be equipped [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2713.6s)]
*  probably better than you to go do those building oriented things. What goes into the thinking [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2717.92s)]
*  around who's going to take what role when you found a company with a scientific background like [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2725.2s)]
*  yours? In my thinking, it's really about, so to be clear, my co-founder, Alex, was CEO for a [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2729.6s)]
*  period of time and then transitioned out of the company about two years ago. And so we had that [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2740.64s)]
*  as sort of an open role. And then we had a search open and then ended up hiring George who we're [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2746.3199999999997s)]
*  fantastically excited about because he's really the right person. In terms of picking roles that [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2753.04s)]
*  you know, from the get-go, we didn't have roles for the first year or two. We're just co-founders. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2759.92s)]
*  And then I think in my thinking about how you pick roles, again, I would go back to something I said [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2769.04s)]
*  earlier, which is what's the role from which I can have the most impact on what we're doing? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2774.16s)]
*  And for me, that was a science. I had a background in oncology from my PhD. I felt like it was [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2779.8399999999997s)]
*  something I was uniquely strong at. And Alex had his own set of strengths that we ended up deciding [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2786.48s)]
*  he would go be CEO. So. Yeah. I was just curious, you know, when you're forming things up, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2793.52s)]
*  it's interesting, you know, who's going to play what role. George, you said, is he right there in [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2799.84s)]
*  your world headquarters with you? You guys kind of in lockstep right now, like on the daily? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2806.08s)]
*  He is. Yeah. So he's been here for two weeks. And then this week he's in SF packing up and moving. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2811.92s)]
*  Oh, very nice. Yeah. It was a two-year period between Alex's departure and bringing George on. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2819.68s)]
*  Didn't. Was that an active search the entire two years? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2829.04s)]
*  Yes. And how did you go about like what were sort of the strategy and the keys to landing the right [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2833.68s)]
*  person? I think looking for someone who was going to be the right kind of leader, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2839.04s)]
*  to lead the culture that we have and that we want to build. And then someone, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2849.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, maybe very secondarily to that, who had a set of skill sets that was complementary [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2855.92s)]
*  to our existing executive team. So we haven't talked about them yet, but or as much, but [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2860.24s)]
*  Sandra, who's our chief operating officer also does a CEO thing, but also runs manufacturing for [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2866.24s)]
*  us. Hasn't had an incredible career in that and very, very skilled. And then Jill Galaan, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2872.56s)]
*  who's our chief development officer comes to us from Daiichi Senkyo. Daiichi is the company that [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2878.72s)]
*  created Inertu, which probably kicked off the current ADC craze as it were. Yeah. And Jill [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2885.04s)]
*  was actually the program lead for Inertu. So that went well. And then he was promoted to [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2892.0s)]
*  head all of oncology clinical development at Daiichi and then came to work with us. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2898.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Building an all-star team. My frequent guest, Alan Shaw says, you know, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2903.84s)]
*  investors don't bet on horses. They bet on jockeys. And it sounds like you put a pretty good team of [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2909.12s)]
*  jockeys together there, I think. Absolutely. What's next? Who's next on your, I shouldn't say who. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2914.72s)]
*  Don't name names. But what role is next on Mythix, I guess, bit less in terms of executive [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2921.36s)]
*  development or, you know, for that matter, even scientific advance? Like who do you need? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2927.36s)]
*  I think we have a pretty complete team right now. You know, we are a private company. I would bet [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2934.96s)]
*  that at some point, you know, we're already starting to think what it would take to become [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2944.8s)]
*  a public company. I don't think we're committed towards that path at all, but it's something you [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2948.8s)]
*  got to think about ahead of time. You know, the thing that comes to mind is maybe there's a [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2952.88s)]
*  chief financial officer in the works if we decide to go down the public company route. But, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2958.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, right now, Sanders running finance and doing quite well at that. So [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2964.0s)]
*  no immediate need there. And I think we're going to focus on onboarding George, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2969.28s)]
*  working with him to figure out next steps in the next few months. And then, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2975.36s)]
*  yeah, build and grow from there. Yeah. Any big next steps or inflection points on the [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2983.6s)]
*  horizon for the company on the whole? Obviously, this trial is probably keeping you pretty busy [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2990.0s)]
*  right now. Yeah, it's an incredibly exciting time at Mythix. So we're wrapping up the dose [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=2995.52s)]
*  escalation phase of our trial. It was done in unselected patients, which we know is not [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3002.08s)]
*  our patient population, but we learned a lot of things about safety, about PK, about dose, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3008.3199999999997s)]
*  and some early signs of efficacy. We were also able to go fast. I mean, that was why we chose to go [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3015.2s)]
*  unselected to begin with was to go fast. And we've achieved that. We've had incredible enrollment [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3022.0s)]
*  up to this point. That's also a credit to the investigators and patients. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3027.36s)]
*  Very thankful for them. And so there's that whole package of data that'll come together this year. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3031.12s)]
*  There's also the package of data that we're going to use to motivate starting I&D enabling work for [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3037.3599999999997s)]
*  our program too. So I'm incredibly excited about that and what we're doing with program too. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3042.24s)]
*  And so from a data perspective, it's a good time to think about another financing. And with that [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3048.96s)]
*  financing, focused on getting into the dose expansion portion of our trial, funding a path [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3055.68s)]
*  to pivotal for the lead program, and then bringing that second program to I&D. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3062.3199999999997s)]
*  And I'm assuming you've shared all that you're willing to share or can share about that second [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3068.7999999999997s)]
*  program? For now, yes. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3073.12s)]
*  All right. I figured, you know, but I had to ask. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3077.44s)]
*  Of course. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3080.08s)]
*  What haven't I asked you that I should have if I were a better interview, Brian? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3081.28s)]
*  Oh, it's been a fantastic interview. I think, you know, maybe the message I would leave with [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3087.2000000000003s)]
*  or that I would focus on is, again, we're a very different type of ADC company, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3093.6800000000003s)]
*  focused on the antibody component. We're not a linker payload company. And we're hoping to [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3101.04s)]
*  stand on the shoulders of what's been done and what will be done on the linker payload side to [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3107.52s)]
*  have this very unique ability to deliver more tumors and get a broader set of patients to [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3112.96s)]
*  respond so that we can replace chemo with something safer and with something more effective. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3120.32s)]
*  Yeah. All right. So I lied. I have one more question for you. Maybe I didn't lie. I don't [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3126.72s)]
*  think I said that was my last question, but you just brought up this point. And we alluded to it [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3131.68s)]
*  earlier, the fact that like the ADC space has sort of exploded in recent months, you know, if not like, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3136.32s)]
*  you know, a short number of years, it's only recently just kind of blown up. And because you [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3143.28s)]
*  just made sort of your final statement around, you know, reiterating this idea that Mythic is [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3148.88s)]
*  a different ADC company with a different approach. What is your take on sort of the crowded landscape [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3155.36s)]
*  and cacophony of noise in the ADC space that's happening at this very moment? What's your take [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3164.7999999999997s)]
*  on it? Like, is it good for Mythic in the industry? Is it challenging to be heard and noticed and seen [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3173.6s)]
*  and differentiated? Is there a bunch of noise out there that needs to be called? Like, what are your [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3182.72s)]
*  general thoughts? So I see two different things going on. One thing that's going on is for ADCs [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3188.8s)]
*  that have positive clinical proof of concept data. There are a lot of deals happening and they're big [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3198.48s)]
*  deals. It's hard to find a deal that looks like that, that is less than a billion dollars up front. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3206.48s)]
*  And that's because ADCs can address large indications and they're highly [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3212.8s)]
*  manufacturable at this point, right? They're not a bespoke manufacturing process like, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3220.4s)]
*  you know, cell and gene therapy, for example. The other thing that's going on is more in the [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3227.6000000000004s)]
*  preclinical space where there is a lot of, you know, I don't know if to call it noise, but [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3235.92s)]
*  a lot of activity. But there, you know, in the preclinical space, it's hard to find a deal [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3241.52s)]
*  with an upfront greater than about $50 million. The other piece, you know, and thing that [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3247.76s)]
*  you have to think of is, you know, with like a cell and gene therapy, particularly, let's say, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3254.64s)]
*  cell therapy, when those deals were happening, you know, in the last five years, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3259.76s)]
*  very few larger companies could do cell therapy, right? And so they were looking for partners to [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3266.96s)]
*  bring that as an expertise. With something like an ADC, farmers can do ADCs, right? They can make an [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3272.7200000000003s)]
*  ADC, they can make antibodies and they can conjugate it to a payload. And so you have to bring something [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3280.88s)]
*  different or you have to bring clinical data to the table. And I think that's what we're looking [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3286.16s)]
*  to do. We're looking to bring both. But I think that the preclinical space is, which is very frothy, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3291.12s)]
*  is inherently capped. We're looking to sort of put that aside and take things to clinical POC, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3300.32s)]
*  where we can generate that usually value inflecting data set. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3305.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Very good. I like that response. Thorough, honest assessment of the [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3309.44s)]
*  space and your role in it. Yeah, we're, we got to wrap things up here. I've been abusing your time, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3316.2400000000002s)]
*  Brian, but it's been a fascinating conversation. I appreciate you coming on and spending some time [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3322.8s)]
*  with us and giving us an update on Mythic. And, you know, we'll be paying attention. I hope to [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3327.6s)]
*  have you back on the show. You know, maybe once you've got some more data coming in from the [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3333.2000000000003s)]
*  clinical trial, maybe when you can share a little bit more on your second program, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3338.56s)]
*  because it's an exciting space and your approach and the uniqueness of your approach is, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3343.84s)]
*  it's great fodder for the conversation. So thank you for coming on. I appreciate it. And we look [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGblEC0_54&t=3349.44s)]
