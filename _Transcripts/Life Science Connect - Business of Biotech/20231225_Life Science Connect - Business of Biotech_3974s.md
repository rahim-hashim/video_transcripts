Video Description: Merry Christmas, Business of Biotechers! On this Christmas Day release, we’re taking a trip to the land down under to visit with Dr. Sam Costello, managing director and co-founder at Adelaide, Australia-based BiomeBank. We covered some ground on this one, most notably the unique path BiomeBank took to chalking up the first donor-derived microbiome therapeutic approval of its kind, anywhere in the world. In a segment of biotech that’s been particularly battered of late, that’s a big, big win. We also talked about what’s behind Australia’s foray onto the global biotech scene, the public/private partnerships supporting that growth, why U.S. biotechs, in particular, are flocking there to conduct clinical trials, and whether Foster’s is really Australian for beer. Don’t miss it!

# Biotech Down Under with BiomeBank's Dr. Sam Costello
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [December 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ)
*  The business of biotech is produced by LifeScience Connect and its community of learning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  solving, and sourcing resources for biopharma decision makers. If you're working on biologics [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=5.2s)]
*  process development and manufacturing challenges, you need to swing by bioprocessonline.com. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=11.44s)]
*  If you're trying to stay ahead of the cell or gene therapy curve, visit cellandgene.com. When it's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=17.12s)]
*  time to map out your clinical course, let clinicalleader.com help. And if optimizing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=22.72s)]
*  outsourcing decisions is what you're after, check out outsourcepharma.com. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=28.4s)]
*  We're LifeScience Connect, and we're here to help. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  In this financial market, plenty of young biotechs are eating gravel, so to speak, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  for the first time. But it's especially hard times for the microbiome therapeutic space. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=44.8s)]
*  Flagships Evelo was the most recent to hit the kill switch. That coming on the heels of 4D Pharma, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=50.64s)]
*  Finch Therapeutics, Federation Bio, and more, either winding down operations or folding into [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=56.56s)]
*  other efforts. A dozen or so more have drastically reduced headcount and programs to preserve cash [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  in recent months. But the scientific premises that microbiome therapeutics sought to capitalize on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=69.36s)]
*  during their hype cycle a few years back haven't gone anywhere. And for some microbiome companies, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=75.44s)]
*  they've even seen some regulatory wins. Adelaide Australia-based Biome Bank is one such winner. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=80.8s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business of Biotech. And on today's episode, we're taking a perhaps [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  sobering but certainly pragmatic and optimistic look at the microbiome therapeutics market with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=93.36s)]
*  the founder and leader of a company whose fecal microbiota transplant therapy was the first of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=99.12s)]
*  its kind approved anywhere. That leader is Dr. Sam Costello, and I'm thrilled to have him on with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=105.36s)]
*  us today. Dr. Costello, welcome to the show. Thanks, Matt. And thanks for having me on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=112.24s)]
*  It's absolutely my pleasure. And we're going to have an extensive conversation here about the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=118.88s)]
*  microbiome market, what's going on in Australia, why on earth your company is, Biome Bank is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=123.76s)]
*  interested in moving some facets of operations to the United States where things are going as well. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=130.16s)]
*  We're going to get into all that. But before we do, I want to get to know you a little bit [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=137.44s)]
*  better. And from what I understand, you know, I've chatted a couple of times now, and you were a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=143.2s)]
*  gastroenterologist, a practicing gastroenterologist for a time before deciding that you're going to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=148.0s)]
*  join industry and found Biome Bank. So tell us, give us, I guess, the why story behind that. Like, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=155.12s)]
*  why would you, you know, you got to, I'm sure a thriving practice doing really well, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=163.44s)]
*  practicing medicine. And you thought, well, you know what, I want to jump into industry. Like, why? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=167.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, it, I suppose sounds a little crazy on the surface, but I mean, I, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  I undertook a PhD focused on fecal transplant for ulcerative colitis. And this, this really began in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=178.8s)]
*  2012 and ran a study where we showed you can induce remission of FMT, induce remission of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=187.12s)]
*  ulcerative colitis using FMT. And during that process, I set up a stool bank in an academic [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=194.72s)]
*  laboratory in Adelaide. And through that started to supply local hospitals and doctors with a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=201.28s)]
*  basic product, an FMT product. So that was sort of like a side business to your practice? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=210.88s)]
*  Well, yeah. So it wasn't so much a business at that point. I was just supplying patients locally [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=218.24s)]
*  who had C. difficile infection that was refractory to antibiotics. In 2013, there was a paper that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=225.12s)]
*  came out in New England Journal showing the clear superiority of donor FMT over what was the then [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=231.28s)]
*  standard of care vancomycin, which, which had a huge Delta. So, you know, 80, 90% fewer rate with [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=237.44s)]
*  FMT versus about 30 with vancomycin. So, so that really got a lot of attention and, and really [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  locally, doctors started to expect that this therapy would be available. Patients and patient [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=256.08s)]
*  families knew that this was available. And so, and in many cases, Matt, this therapy is saves a colon, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  colectomy is the, is the, would have been the, the outcome if you're failing antibiotics for or [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=270.48s)]
*  death, you know, it's a, it's a potentially deadly condition CD for seal. And so we had this service [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=276.56s)]
*  established and expectation established, but, but at the, towards the end of the study, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=282.0s)]
*  research funding had dried up and I needed a way to sustain the service. I could also see there was [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=290.16s)]
*  an unmet medical need throughout many other parts of Australia and our region. So in Asia, generally. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=296.08s)]
*  Let me interrupt you real, real quick there. You mentioned locally a couple of times you set up this, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=303.36s)]
*  this bank, you were serving, when you say you were serving doctors locally, are you talking like [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=308.48s)]
*  real, real local, like local to Adelaide? Yeah. Yeah. So initially, you know, I was doing this [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=314.0s)]
*  operation myself. I was collecting the stool and screening donors, banking it. And I'd get it, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=319.68s)]
*  I'd get a call from a doctor and jump in my car, grab the, jump in my car, grab, grab some out of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=324.64s)]
*  the Fraser, drive it over to the hospital and sometimes administer it myself or give it to the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=330.64s)]
*  gastroenterologist to administer, you know, there's a patient in intensive care who needed it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=335.92s)]
*  And it was really a basic operation at that stage. And, and, but it was highly effective. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=340.16s)]
*  And so we needed a way to sustain the service and could see that it, that it could be supplied more, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=348.32s)]
*  more broadly. And so we, we joined with the hospital search foundation who provided seed capital [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  to us so that we could, we formed a company that could then transact with hospitals and, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=363.44s)]
*  and really our primary aim at that point was to, was to develop an approved therapy. So we, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=369.52s)]
*  we built a clean room, bought on a quality team, a reg team and started to aim towards that and had [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=375.92s)]
*  a second name of developing culture. So second generation microbiome therapies. Yeah, that, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=383.12s)]
*  that's fascinating. The, the original, for lack of a better term, product that you were banking [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=390.56s)]
*  and, and, and delivering, you were like the, the, the, the Amazon prime to the Adelaide area. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=398.4s)]
*  Same day service. That, that quote unquote product, was that like, was that an approved [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=406.96s)]
*  therapeutic product or explain how that works? No, so I mean, in those days, it was a little [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=414.16s)]
*  wild west in the sense that there wasn't a regulatory framework in Australia for, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=422.16s)]
*  for FMT. And it was a really, I mean, has it been an interesting [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  developments during that time? I mean, FMT had been done in Australia for many years, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  probably 30 years at least. And, and so, and, and we'd been, we've undertaken this, I have [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=436.72s)]
*  personally since, since 2012 here. And so at that time we had sort of local ethics approval, but [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  there was no national framework. It didn't really fit into the existing regulatory framework. And so [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=453.44000000000005s)]
*  over that period of time, a number of stakeholders, so clinicians, patient groups, et cetera, worked [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=458.8s)]
*  with the TGA to establish a framework. And that, that was essentially what became TGA 105, where [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=464.96s)]
*  this is, this is the framework for which these products, so microbiome therapies, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  donor drive microbiome therapies are regulated in Australia. And that, that is through, through the, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=477.84s)]
*  that program is how, how we achieved our approval. Yeah. So the, the decision to found a biotech [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=483.28s)]
*  effectively, would you say that at the time when you decided to do that, that, that sort of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=493.84s)]
*  evolution or revolution of the framework was a catalyst? Like was that, was that part of your [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  thought process? Like this is a time to sort of, to sort of strike because there's, there are, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=505.67999999999995s)]
*  there are actually some parameters being put around this therapeutic idea. Yeah. So, so I was [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=510.4s)]
*  involved in some of these discussions and I could see that a framework was being laid down and there [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=517.8399999999999s)]
*  was a path to, there was going to be a path to approval. And so we were a small company, but the, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=522.56s)]
*  I mean, the TGA, I think were forward thinking and pragmatic here. They had a situation where [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=529.76s)]
*  essentially a important and potentially lifesaving therapy was being supplied to patients [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=535.92s)]
*  to, to, to set a framework where that had to stop instantly and, and, you know, demand phase [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=543.52s)]
*  clinical trials would of course led to a lot of morbidity and mortality. And so they set up [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=549.6s)]
*  transition arrangements whereby you had to meet certain criteria. So the first was GMP. So we built [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=556.16s)]
*  a, you know, we built, we fundraised and built a clean room. And then we had to have a dossier [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=562.0s)]
*  that prepared and submitted. And that, that dossier had many of the, the components that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=567.28s)]
*  you would acquire for pharmaceutical, but the key, two key differences were that the, there wasn't a [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  requirement for batch to batch consistency in terms of the composition, because of course, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=579.6s)]
*  that's not possible with a donor drug therapy such as this. The second was that we could use [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  existing data package. So we had a, we had real world data that we'd accumulated. And so there [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=590.24s)]
*  was a requirement to, to, to submit that and then continue to supply that. And so that, that framework [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=598.96s)]
*  we saw was, was possible and, and, and, and really allowed patients to continue to access [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=608.56s)]
*  therapy during that time. And then, and now to supply therapy, you'd need an approval. So, so, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  so this is also improved safety and all of these other aspects, because there are strict [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  requirements around screening and that sort of thing. Yeah. So it was advantageous to be [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=629.04s)]
*  involved, like heavily involved sort of at the ground floor or early on. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=635.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think, yeah, a lot of clinicians were involved in, in, in, in those discussions and, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=641.76s)]
*  and you know, patient advocate groups and these people that led, led to what was, I think, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=649.68s)]
*  a considered and pragmatic solution. I mean, you could see in the, say, say in the US, there's a [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=656.2399999999999s)]
*  different approach, say with enforcement discretion around a similar time and in, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=663.36s)]
*  in Europe and other jurisdictions they've taken, you know, different approaches and these sort of [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=668.16s)]
*  therapies are regulated in, in, in different, different ways. It's, it's, it, it has been, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=673.52s)]
*  I'd say heterogeneous around the world. Yeah. Yeah. Tell me about that during that transition [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=679.12s)]
*  from practice to founding of the company, was it a clean break or did you, did you continue to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=687.76s)]
*  practice for a while and kind of build the company up in the background? What did that look like? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I did, Matt. I mean, I didn't wake up one morning and think, gee, I want to be in, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  in biotech. It was, it was this sort of clinical need to start with. And then, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=703.52s)]
*  and so I continued practice. I wound it down. I was working a couple of days a week in practice [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=708.16s)]
*  and then running the company. And, but I could see that to make it work, it was going to need [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=717.3599999999999s)]
*  absolute dedicated focus. And the other thing was with the second arm to the company, the cultured [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=726.0799999999999s)]
*  therapies, when, when, when I could see that we had the technology to, to, to build an artificial [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=731.3599999999999s)]
*  microbiome, so a co-cultured consortia that would, you know, be scalable to global markets and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  actually be able to make a difference to the big problem of loss of gut microbial ecology. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=746.16s)]
*  That, that's the moment where I thought I've got, I've got to quit and absolutely focus [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  and dedicated focus on this, because to get, to, to get that to work, to, to actually, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  to, to, to make, to make it, to, to, to allow us to really develop that technology, I was going to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  need to, to be all in. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, the, the, the origin story doesn't really get more [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=774.32s)]
*  organic than that. Like it's, it's truly an organic, like growth, right? Sprouting of a, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=780.88s)]
*  of a biotech. Yeah. Yeah. And I, yeah. And it's funny, Matt, because I mean, if I'd known, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  I suppose the complexity of it all, being, being naive to it was, was advantageous because if [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=793.36s)]
*  someone had sat me down on day one and said, oh, this is, this is what's required, I would have [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  thought, ah, nah. Let me, let me, let me tell you what you're setting yourself up for here. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=803.28s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. But you know, you sort of slowly, and, and, and that, and that's been wonderful [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  because there's so much to learn. I love learning and especially the entrepreneurial aspect, the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=812.72s)]
*  business side of it. It's been, you know, it's invigorating learning, learning new things and, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=817.1999999999999s)]
*  and you know, right. Scary and, scary and risky at the same time. Like when you were, when you were [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=823.52s)]
*  making that transition, what, like personally having been a practicing physician and, and working [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=832.16s)]
*  in the space. And then, you know, as you said, gradually and in a metered, metered and responsible [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=839.52s)]
*  approach, building a company, there had to be, you know, times, even, even though you're an [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=845.36s)]
*  naive optimist, optimist, optimist, right? And naive optimist, there had to be times where you're [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  like, you know, there, there are some challenges here that I may not be tooled up for, geared up [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=855.6s)]
*  for. Like what were some of those kinds of personal and professional challenges that you [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=861.04s)]
*  faced down and overcame? Yeah, I mean, the, the, the unknown, I mean, there was this, this challenge [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  that I didn't know what it was to, to, to run a biotech and, and, and so there were, and, and, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  and a startup business. And so there were, there were a whole lot of elements there. And I've been [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=882.88s)]
*  really lucky that we've, I've been surrounded by people who are, who have been far more [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=887.6s)]
*  knowledgeable than me in many different areas. And I suppose it was trying to identify what those [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=892.72s)]
*  gaps were, find people who could mentor or, or, or, or, or educate me. So we've had, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=899.04s)]
*  we've had many challenges. So, you know, regulatory challenges, financial challenges, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=907.68s)]
*  financial challenges, issues around me, we have a product that's approved and out in the market. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=913.12s)]
*  So learning about, about that, trying to set up supply, many different aspects. And then there's [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=919.28s)]
*  the, the, the, the scientific aspects around the culture therapies that are very complex as well. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=929.84s)]
*  I mean, we have, I think some of the world's leading scientists in this space. And so, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=937.36s)]
*  so learning from them in that, and, and we have a board that has, and we have [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=944.64s)]
*  people with biotech experience, US biotech experience on the board, entrepreneurial experience, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=951.6s)]
*  corporate financial experience. And, and I've learned a lot from these people. Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=958.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's a good, it's a good segue into some questions I wanted to ask you about [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  the sort of the biotech scene in Australia, you know, from, I guess, you know, the, the general, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=967.68s)]
*  or maybe naive or rudimentary, I think, perception of Australia to US biotech says like, hey, that's [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  a, it's a great place to go run clinical trials. And I've got some questions for you about that [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=982.56s)]
*  a little bit later on, like why that, why that appeal exists, you know, whether that's regulatory, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=986.4s)]
*  financial, whatever it might be. I've heard from several biotech leaders that Australia is a [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=991.84s)]
*  desirable place for financial and regulatory reasons to run clinical trials. Beyond that, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=997.2s)]
*  I want to, I guess, get a lay of the land for the biotech scene in Australia. You're in Adelaide, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1004.1600000000001s)]
*  and I will put my geographic ignorance on full display here. You know, tell us about Adelaide, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1010.48s)]
*  and then tell us like, where is the biotech like scene centered in Australia? Is it, is it Adelaide? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1019.2s)]
*  Is it, is it Sydney? Is it like, you know, where's the, where's the hub? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1024.8s)]
*  It is distributed. I mean, Australia is obviously, it's geographically a large country, but from [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1031.68s)]
*  population wise, a lot smaller than the US. And, and so, you know, it's 25 million people. And, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1037.76s)]
*  and so, the biotech scene is primarily centered in Sydney and Melbourne, the two largest cities. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1044.72s)]
*  I mean, there is quite a vibrancy, and I think here in Adelaide as well, but 70% of the biotechs are [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1051.5200000000002s)]
*  in Sydney and Melbourne. So there's, there's probably about a close to a thousand biotech [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  companies in each of those two cities. And the biotech scene is, is growing. And the life sciences [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1062.88s)]
*  sector generally, I mean, it's grown. I was talking to Lorraine Sharouf, who's the CEO of [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1071.6s)]
*  Ausbiotech recently, and she was saying it's growing. So I think 43% since, since 2019, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1078.0s)]
*  60% since 2017. And you're right, Australia has had an economy that has been initially resource [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1084.7199999999998s)]
*  focused, and more recently, services, you know, financial services, and these sort of things. But, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1094.7199999999998s)]
*  biotech has been a relatively small player. But that is, that is changing. And the real [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1099.44s)]
*  opportunity here, Matt, is that Australia is, is world class at basic research, so medical research, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, top, top 10 in the world in terms of output, you know, significant medical journals, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1114.8s)]
*  at that level. But the commercialization into biotech has really been lacking. I mean, there's [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1122.32s)]
*  some outstanding companies, you know, CSL is based in Australia and around resmed, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1128.24s)]
*  Cochlear, there were real success stories. But, but that gap, where we perform more poorly at the, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1133.04s)]
*  at the translation commercialization, that to me is opportunity when you have all the right [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1139.84s)]
*  early stage inventions, and we just need to develop that second stage. And that's [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1144.64s)]
*  what we're doing and we're really passionate about. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1152.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. When you talk about that, you know, that, I guess the foundations of building an [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  industry, there are like support mechanisms that I think about, like when I think about support [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1166.08s)]
*  mechanisms or support institutions here in the States, you know, maybe it starts with [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1170.8s)]
*  academia, you know, it includes obviously access to capital and the financial markets. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1176.56s)]
*  You mentioned a few of the big, you know, the bigger players that are Australia based. So, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, you obviously want a community of established bio-pharma, maybe some big bio, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1186.3999999999999s)]
*  obviously that's a market to sell to a market to support a market to partner with. So I want to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  work through some of these, I guess, some of these elements individually, let's start with like, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1196.48s)]
*  capital access. You know, I mean, I, you know, globally, it's a struggle right now. I get that, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1200.8799999999999s)]
*  but like in good market conditions and current market conditions, what does that look like [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1207.36s)]
*  in Australia, access to funding and, you know, kind of go forward juice, if you will. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1214.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's critical, isn't it? It's the lifeblood. So, I mean, there is a smaller [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1219.28s)]
*  pool of capital in Australia and then the US and less VC specific. So biotech specific focused [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1224.4s)]
*  VC funding here than the US. But the situation is certainly improving, I would say. I mean, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1232.3200000000002s)]
*  it has been rough recently because of the global conditions. And that's the same everywhere. But [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1240.0s)]
*  I think one thing that is why I'm really optimistic in this space as well is that [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1247.76s)]
*  Australia has a really well capitalised superannuation system. So that's like pension [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1257.36s)]
*  funds. I mean, we have the world's fourth largest pension pool in the world. And, you know, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1263.04s)]
*  our population is the 55th biggest. So there's a really big pension funds relative to population. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1268.64s)]
*  And, you know, that's I think 2.6 trillion US dollars sitting there. A lot of that's deployed [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1276.56s)]
*  into larger biotech, so late stage biotech, some of that money. And now some of that is being [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1283.4399999999998s)]
*  deployed into VCs and that can then enter the earlier stage biotech. So I think that's a real [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1290.32s)]
*  strength that Australia has and can be, I think, you know, leveraged by the biotech community [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1299.04s)]
*  if we approach this in a smart way. Yeah. Yeah. What about, excuse me, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1307.2s)]
*  I woke up yesterday morning with like the post Thanksgiving, I don't know, head cold. I tested [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1314.48s)]
*  for COVID, did a rapid antigen test at home. I don't know, they're not 100% accurate. It said [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1319.92s)]
*  negative. And I feel fine otherwise. I'm a little congested from the throat up. So excuse me for [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1324.96s)]
*  that. But what about- I feel safe here from the other side of the world. Yeah, you're on the other [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1329.76s)]
*  side of the world. We're speaking through a screen. It'll catch everything. You're good. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1335.1200000000001s)]
*  The talent pool, I talked about academia. You know, you talked about [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1340.24s)]
*  translational sort of being a catch point there. What does the academic scene look like in Australia? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1345.76s)]
*  Where is the next gen and the ongoing sort of talent and IP pool coming from if you look at [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1353.44s)]
*  Australia in and of itself? I mean, do you have like the equivalent of Harvard's and MIT's and- [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1360.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, so we don't have a, I suppose, Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Cambridge, top five in the [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1370.48s)]
*  world university here, but we have a number in the world's top 100 universities. And so I think, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1379.76s)]
*  it might be four or five in the world's top 100. Our local university here in Adelaide is top 100. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1388.32s)]
*  We had a lot of top research coming out of Australia. I mean, my local university has [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1395.52s)]
*  four or five Nobel Prize winners. There is absolutely world-class research. In microbiome, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1404.88s)]
*  say, we have Sam Forster, who's our chief scientific officer, was involved in a seminal [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1416.0s)]
*  publication in the field, Culturing the Unculturable, that was published in Nature [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1425.3600000000001s)]
*  and really described methods to actually be able to grow human gut microbes. This was in 2016. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1428.64s)]
*  So he and colleagues showed this. And prior to that point, it wasn't possible to have a [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1435.8400000000001s)]
*  microbiome therapeutics industry other than a donor-derived industry, like a cultured [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1442.3200000000002s)]
*  microbiome theories, because of course you need to be able to grow them. And so breakthroughs like that [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1446.72s)]
*  are being done by Australians, just to give one example. But typically what's then happened is [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1452.48s)]
*  either that those results haven't been capitalized on with good, say, often IP protection and then [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1462.48s)]
*  commercialization historically. But I think that's definitely changing, that this has been recognized [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1474.6399999999999s)]
*  by government and there are schemes now in place to help with that. Research funding is given [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1481.6000000000001s)]
*  now on the basis that a people's track record with commercialization is considered. And sort of this [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1489.3600000000001s)]
*  culture is changing with this and understanding that commercialization is necessary to get [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1495.92s)]
*  products to patients. And also there's economic opportunities for the country in doing [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1502.5600000000002s)]
*  that. Yeah. Yeah. I guess elaborate a little bit on that, the sort of the incentive programs [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1510.8s)]
*  that Australia itself, like the government there, is putting into place to foster growth of the [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1518.1599999999999s)]
*  biotech community. Yeah. So I think probably the most successful so far has been the R&D tax [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1523.84s)]
*  incentive. So this is a scheme whereby the Australian federal government will reimburse [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1530.32s)]
*  about 42 cents in the dollar spent on R&D in the industry. And so that's been hugely helpful for [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1539.68s)]
*  us because it's essentially a non-dilutive capital from a lot of what we've been doing has been R&D. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1546.72s)]
*  And so that's been a real help. And actually some of that is accessible even to foreign companies [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1554.3200000000002s)]
*  if they're working in Australia. So doing clinical trials in Australia, they can potentially [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1564.16s)]
*  access that. And that has really driven a lot of the, I suppose, mini boom in biotech that we've [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1569.92s)]
*  seen and particularly in the clinical trial space. There are also funds, the Medical Research Future [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1581.8400000000001s)]
*  Fund, which has been spun out of Australia's sovereign wealth fund. And so that's a large [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1590.56s)]
*  amount of capital that's being deployed into medical research, but it is targeted at [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1603.2s)]
*  research that has commercial potential and really encouraging [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1609.2s)]
*  the IP generation and then commercialization of that. And there are a number of other [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1612.4s)]
*  programs now. And so I think that explains part of this rapid growth in the last five or 10 years. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1622.4s)]
*  Greg Foss Yeah. You mentioned that some of those incentives are available in some cases to [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1631.52s)]
*  global companies, companies from the US perhaps or the UK who are coming to Australia to [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1637.6000000000001s)]
*  conduct clinical trials. And I'm curious about whether there's any sort of reciprocity or benefit, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1642.48s)]
*  reciprocity of value or benefit to the Australian biotech scene as a result of those companies [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1649.68s)]
*  coming down there to conduct clinicals or if it's more of a nuisance at any point where it's like, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1657.0400000000002s)]
*  we're trying to grow our own community down here and you're consuming access to our patient [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1665.3600000000001s)]
*  population. What's the balance there? David Hicks [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1670.16s)]
*  Look, I see it as overwhelmingly positive. I mean, I just think the ecosystem thrives [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1674.88s)]
*  off connection. And I mean, I was in say Boston recently and just walking around there, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1681.44s)]
*  I remember being in a bar and sitting down having some food and the guy next to me was [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1689.6000000000001s)]
*  running a biotech. We just chatted for an hour casually and I had a whole lot of contacts that [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1694.0s)]
*  I could then make and learned a lot from him. And so the more we can draw in, I think the better [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1699.76s)]
*  we'll all be. There is a bit of competition now in hospitals to run trials and patient access. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1708.08s)]
*  I think though we were founded by, you know, we're the three clinicians. And so we have [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1718.16s)]
*  extensive networks of local say gastroenterologists say for our trials that we can access [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1726.88s)]
*  very easily. So that's not a problem. And I think the local CROs getting this business makes them [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1732.4s)]
*  more, you know, builds their skill set, makes them interacting with companies say from the US and [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1740.8s)]
*  Europe improves their offering. And so that feeds back into the ecosystem. And then, you know, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1748.72s)]
*  the companies that supply that are analyzing samples out of these studies, they're building [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1755.2800000000002s)]
*  large capacity as well. So that then feeds back into the system. So I think it's just [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1763.2s)]
*  overwhelmingly positive. Yeah, that's terrific. Total question out of left field. When you stopped [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1767.7600000000002s)]
*  at that bar in Boston and where you were talking about that biotech, were you drinking at Foster's? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1774.4s)]
*  Or is that like, is that like marketing? Is that just like marketing hype? Foster's isn't really [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1779.12s)]
*  Australian for beer. Well, the funny thing is you can get Foster's generally overseas. It's very [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1786.7199999999998s)]
*  hard to find it locally in Australia. Yeah. I can't remember. It might've been a Sam Adams. I can't [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1793.6799999999998s)]
*  remember. Yeah, that's the reason. That's great. So yeah, so you know, there's another good segue. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1799.36s)]
*  You're talking about spending some time in Boston. You're talking about the advantages of US and UK [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1807.36s)]
*  and beyond companies coming down to Australia to do some business. The last time we spoke, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1813.28s)]
*  you mentioned that you were seeking to or in the process of opening a satellite office in the US. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1818.1599999999999s)]
*  Are you in the process of opening a satellite office here? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1827.6799999999998s)]
*  So we're not in the process right now, but we certainly want to do that. I mean, for some of [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1830.0s)]
*  those reasons we talked about, I mean the connectivity. We do have a director based in [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1842.4s)]
*  Boston and other connections to the US. Chief Operating Officer is American and Head of Process [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1849.28s)]
*  Development American and we want to be linked to that ecosystem and the US is still the global [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1858.32s)]
*  leader in biotech innovation, huge amount of innovation there and half of the world's [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1869.28s)]
*  farmer market. So we want our products to get into that market ultimately. So there will [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1874.96s)]
*  necessarily be a presence in the US and so we're working towards that. I mean, probably [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1884.88s)]
*  post capital raising we would look at that. Yeah. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1891.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You sort of gave us some of the story around the regulatory context of the formation [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1895.68s)]
*  of your company in Australia. I'm curious about what, like should you, you just mentioned that [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1906.3200000000002s)]
*  you'd like to, you know, I'm assuming the approved product, is that what you would like to [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1912.64s)]
*  bring to the United States? Is that sort of in the plans? Yeah. So we want to for an orphan [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1917.1200000000001s)]
*  disease indication, not for C. diffusile because there are existing approved products there. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1923.6000000000001s)]
*  Serious therapeutics fairing have approved products for C. diffusile and that's not, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1928.88s)]
*  you know, it's not something we're going after, but this would be for an orphan [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1934.0800000000002s)]
*  disease indication and then the culture therapies are where we want to, you know, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1941.6000000000001s)]
*  we want to take those through our base clinical trials and targeting ulcerative colitis and Crohn's [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1949.6000000000001s)]
*  disease in the first instance with those. But that would be, you know, there's a number of [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1956.5600000000002s)]
*  trials to do before we would be close to market with those. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1961.6000000000001s)]
*  For emerging biotechs, scaling the process development and manufacturing of biologic [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1965.28s)]
*  molecules to clinical standards can be a challenge. However, you don't need to go it alone. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1972.48s)]
*  Don't miss an episode of the Business of Biotech podcast where we offer insights on regulatory, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1977.76s)]
*  funding and other essential topics. The pod is brought to you in collaboration with Cytiva, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1983.04s)]
*  a global provider of technologies and services that advance and accelerate the development, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1988.32s)]
*  manufacture and delivery of therapeutics. Check out the resources at Cytiva.com backslash [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1993.44s)]
*  emerging biotech. That's C-Y-T-I-V-A.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=1999.92s)]
*  I guess that's where I was kind of wanting to go with that question is what, what, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2008.8s)]
*  having gone through a unique regulatory experience in Australia, you know, if you sort of juxtapose [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2012.56s)]
*  that with what you anticipate in the States with the FDA, what have you and the company [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2020.8s)]
*  sort of done to prepare for that? Because obviously it's good, you know, that will be a far [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2029.12s)]
*  different experience from the approval experience that you had down there. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2034.48s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's a very, very, very different challenge. I'd say that having [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2039.6s)]
*  been through a different process with the TGA, it's still, we've still learned a huge amount [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2044.96s)]
*  as an early stage biotech. So, you know, we have a quality team, a regulatory team. We've had to [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2051.2s)]
*  interact with, you know, a different agency and have learned a lot in that process. And I think [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2057.44s)]
*  those learnings are really helpful when we're looking at our early stage assets, because you [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2062.88s)]
*  can, there are a whole lot of things you know, you then need to have, you know, release assets, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2070.64s)]
*  all of these things. Right. And you need to think about that from the start. So how you, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2075.12s)]
*  how you're designing the products and process so that it would gather data that's going to be [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2079.92s)]
*  important for, you know, IND and trials and then registration. And so that's actually been a really [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2089.12s)]
*  helpful process. But we are, we're well aware that this is different. And so, you know, we've, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2097.68s)]
*  you know, our COO, Colby Day has come out of cell therapies and has done this process many times [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2109.44s)]
*  with cell therapies in the US, he's American and has interacted with the FDA a lot. And so [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2116.64s)]
*  that was a very deliberate to bring someone like Colby into the company. And with our regulatory [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2124.24s)]
*  team, we've had informal interactions with the FDA at conferences and things and trying to learn as [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2131.2799999999997s)]
*  much as we can about that process. But we, and yeah, we have, you know, a plan for both of these [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2137.6s)]
*  therapies that don't have derived and cultured therapy, but knowing that there's going to be a [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2152.24s)]
*  lot of challenges there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Would you, would you say that like looking forward, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2157.68s)]
*  you know, forward looking statement, looking into your crystal ball, you know, you, you file your [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2163.6s)]
*  IND in the US and you're ready to go to clinic. Will you sort of follow that trend that we discussed [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2169.3599999999997s)]
*  earlier and conduct clinical trials in Australia? We'll be looking to do [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2177.52s)]
*  distributed clinical trials. What is it too early to say? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2181.44s)]
*  So our phase one B with cultured therapy and ulcerative colitis would run in Australia [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2185.76s)]
*  because there are a number of advantages to do so. So the, I've talked about our network here. So [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2192.48s)]
*  patient network, the R&D tax incentive, the cost and speed of studies as well. So we, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2200.4s)]
*  we can go into humans without an iron, without the R&D here at the phase one in Australia. And so [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2206.96s)]
*  these are some of the reasons why American, you know, American companies say are doing [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2215.04s)]
*  early, their early phase studies in Australia. So, so, so we would want to take advantage of the, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2218.56s)]
*  the, you know, the, all of those things that we have here. But, but beyond that, our studies would, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2225.12s)]
*  would be across both the US, Australia and, and even beyond. So if, if, if we were to [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2232.48s)]
*  be successful with our orphan drug designation and were successful in, in, in, in, in, in, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2239.36s)]
*  you know, go forward with a, with a, say, let's say a single pivotal trial for the donor drive [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2248.4s)]
*  therapy, that, that would, that would be necessarily in the US, but also could have some patients in a [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2255.68s)]
*  Australia. Yeah, very good. I wanted to ask you, while we were talking about that, that, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2262.32s)]
*  that clinical trend in Australia, what advice would you give US companies who are considering [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2268.1600000000003s)]
*  taking advantage of some of those advantages in, in, in the clinical trials seen down in Australia? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2275.2000000000003s)]
*  What advice would you give them, you know, in anticipation of bringing their clinical trials [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2280.56s)]
*  down there? Yeah, so there are a few things, I suppose. So, yeah, finding a CRO that had really [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2285.04s)]
*  good local knowledge, and that would be important. Getting advice on the, on the R&D tax incentive, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2293.2s)]
*  I would say, because I don't know how, how this is accessed by, from, by foreign companies, but, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2302.24s)]
*  but I know that it is done and, and, but getting good advice on that, I think, would be [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2309.9199999999996s)]
*  another thing. And also trying to develop your own network locally, so getting to know some KOLs, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2315.3599999999997s)]
*  etc., so that, so that you, you're not just, I suppose, just relying on a CRO to, to, to, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2323.9199999999996s)]
*  to do that for you, because, I mean, I know, myself, we certainly have, have that advantage, and it is [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2330.3999999999996s)]
*  very helpful when it comes to, say, patient recruitment. Yeah. I want to, I, I want to have [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2336.96s)]
*  a bit of a broader conversation with you about the potential, you know, I mentioned in the intro [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2345.36s)]
*  there, I talked about the sort of hype cycle that microbiome therapeutics experienced a few years ago, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2351.92s)]
*  and we're seeing some of that hype kind of fizzle, you know, at times here in the States. And yet, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2358.8s)]
*  and yet, you know, anytime I speak with people in this space, the indication, the potential [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2364.56s)]
*  indications, like, they're far and wide, you know, anything that the, you know, the gut mediated [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2369.84s)]
*  diseases, sometimes I'm like, wow, like, how, how do you draw a line from the gut to that indication? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2377.52s)]
*  Right. So I want to get your general sense again, you know, I don't, I don't want you to make any [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2384.4s)]
*  crazy forward looking statements, but I want to get your general sense around, you know, what does [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2390.4s)]
*  Dr. Sam Costello believe to be possible looking forward in terms of, you know, what's next in [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2394.8s)]
*  terms of microbiome therapeutics? Like what, where does it, where does the potential begin and end? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2403.52s)]
*  I know it's a very, it's a very big broad question, but I hope you kind of get what I'm going for. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2411.52s)]
*  It is. I mean, but, but look, fundamentally, the field is, is, is necessary. And, and, and, and, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2416.56s)]
*  essentially, because Matt, I mean, gut microbes are critical to our health is the foundational [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2428.0s)]
*  principle. And we've, we've outsourced a lot of function from an evolutionary point of view to, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2433.52s)]
*  to a gut microbe. So there are a whole lot of functions that they perform that we can't [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2440.24s)]
*  ourselves. And these range from, you know, basic things like digesting our food, but educating the [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2443.68s)]
*  immune system. The lining of the gut requires metabolites that are produced by the gut microbiome [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2448.24s)]
*  and a whole range of these, these metabolites might be peptides, neurotransmitters, all sorts [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2456.3199999999997s)]
*  of things that, that have health benefits and are actually necessary for our health. And so [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2462.0s)]
*  we know this, we also know that gut microbes are being stripped out. So, so if you look at the [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2469.52s)]
*  diversity of composition in communities like the US, Australia, we can see that there are [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2474.3199999999997s)]
*  significantly diminished diversity. So organisms, but also the functional [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2483.2799999999997s)]
*  ability of these organisms relative to populations living more, say traditional lifestyles, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2490.3199999999997s)]
*  things like antibiotic exposure are correlated with a wide range of diseases later in life, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2495.04s)]
*  particularly if you have antibiotic exposure earlier in life. It's a very common disease, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2500.64s)]
*  inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, asthma, things like this. These are, these are associative data, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2504.08s)]
*  but then we know now that through predominantly through fecal transplant studies, if you replace [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2510.48s)]
*  these missing microbes, you can treat disease and cure disease. So see the, see the facility, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2516.48s)]
*  you know, the, the well recognized case, but, but inflammatory bowel disease, so ulcerative [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2522.4s)]
*  colitis, there's a large number of trials now, a trial we ran, but there's now at least eight [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2528.08s)]
*  meta analysis of this showing clear superiority of donor FMT over placebo. And so, so, so there [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2533.36s)]
*  will, there will absolutely be the microbiome therapies in that space, I'm convinced. And, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2540.4s)]
*  and then there are other diseases. So, you know, liver disease, hepatic and kefalopathy, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2549.2s)]
*  there's evidence and then companies say like antibiotics developing a therapy, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2554.0s)]
*  their oncology, there's some fascinating, so, you know, basic science data, but also evidence, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2559.12s)]
*  again, from fecal transplant studies that say, to give an example with checkpoint inhibitors, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2566.4s)]
*  a diminished microbiome predicts a poor response to checkpoint inhibitors. And in fact, if you [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2573.04s)]
*  collect stool from a responder to a checkpoint inhibitor and transplant it into someone with, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2579.2s)]
*  who's failing a checkpoint inhibitor, in some of those cases, the therapy could be, you know, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2585.2799999999997s)]
*  switched on. And, and, you know, graft versus host disease, so Matt Farmer, I know you had OVA on [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2590.08s)]
*  the program recently, you know, they're developing a therapy and that looks promising in that space. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2598.0s)]
*  And there are some things that are, I would say surprising, some data that are surprising. So, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2605.68s)]
*  so, you know, so there are FMT studies in autism that, for instance, where, where they've showed [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2612.24s)]
*  improvement in both GI, but also some neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Now, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2620.3999999999996s)]
*  now these are early pilot studies, but there is a trend towards, certainly, we know that loss of [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2628.24s)]
*  organisms is associated with disease, but now, now replacing them, there is, there is increasing [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2638.16s)]
*  evidence in a range of diseases. So, and so, so fundamentally, the field is sitting on, on [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2645.52s)]
*  a massive problem for humanity, which is the loss of gut microbes and the, the, the health [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2654.48s)]
*  implications of that. And this is, this is a massive problem that needs a solution. And so, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2659.92s)]
*  that's why fundamentally I'm so confident that the field will succeed because it is necessary [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2666.88s)]
*  that, that we succeed. Yeah. And it's the, you know, I think about just a silly anecdote, if you [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2672.16s)]
*  will. My daughter used to show horses. She, she showed her, she was, you know, she was an equestrian [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2680.72s)]
*  for quite some time. And, you know, she had a trainer at one point who, like, if the horse got [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2685.9199999999996s)]
*  hurt, like, you know, got a cut on its ear or something, you know, it was like, oh, no, no [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2690.08s)]
*  bother. It's a long way from the heart was sort of the, the mantra, you know, it's a long way from [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2693.8399999999997s)]
*  the heart. That was like the colloquial thing to say. Yeah. But it speaks to sort of this, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess, locality of the indication that you're treating with, you know, like you said, CDF, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2703.6s)]
*  I mean, it seems like a pretty obvious one, bowel disease, you know, it seems like relatively, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2708.96s)]
*  relatively obvious. You get into think, you know, discussions around autism and, and, and [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2713.36s)]
*  Alzheimer's. I've had conversations with like, you know, whether, you know, the gut brain access [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2718.7200000000003s)]
*  and the impacts there, that's where it becomes a little bit more like, like I said, it's harder [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2723.2s)]
*  to draw straight lines to a, to a neo feet, neo fight like me. Right. But, but as in terms of the, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2727.84s)]
*  the business, like as a, as a businessman who's in this space, what is like, when you look at [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2734.64s)]
*  biobanks immediate and potentially long-term intentions, is the immediate attention to, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2740.24s)]
*  or intention to, to, to, to continue to focus sort of on the, on gut related indications themselves? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2746.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And so in the near future, we have a program culture therapy for ulcerative colitis that we [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2756.96s)]
*  anticipate would have action with Crohn's disease. Also, it has a mechanism applicable to both of [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2764.3199999999997s)]
*  those. And then a donor drive therapy is often indication. And so they are GI focused, but from, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2770.0s)]
*  I mean, from this, this problem, the philosophy of gut microbes is so huge, Matt, that, and, and, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2777.7599999999998s)]
*  and does extend into a number of, you know, varying disease areas. We, we really wanted to make it, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2784.64s)]
*  we want to make a global impact. And from first principles, we, we believe that these, these [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2791.04s)]
*  therapies need to be diverse in their composition. So, so actually have a breadth of function because [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2796.8s)]
*  we know that many of the therapeutic properties of, of the microbiome, the ecosystem properties, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2804.96s)]
*  they exist with the functional complexity. So they're emergent therapeutic properties. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2813.12s)]
*  And when you reduce them to their, you can't necessarily reduce them to the elemental form. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2817.68s)]
*  So down to one strain. And we've demonstrated this in the lab with, in the case of our IBD [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2823.68s)]
*  therapy that works by consuming hydrogen sulfide. So we've, we've, we've noted that we've, we've [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2830.64s)]
*  screened our culture collection, say, we've got 35,000 individual strains and we screened it for [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2836.72s)]
*  the ability to consume hydrogen sulfide, the most potent consumer of hydrogen sulfide in the, in the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2841.12s)]
*  collection. But we put that head to head against our consortium of diverse consortium of strains [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2846.56s)]
*  that more, more looks like a donor community. And, and actually the diverse consortia outperform [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2852.0s)]
*  the most potent consumer individually. And so, and so we see that, that the complexity is important. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2858.96s)]
*  And we, we've, we've, we've now demonstrated this, this emergent property. We've seen that more, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2866.56s)]
*  more broadly with other, other aspects. And so we, so, so I think this is, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2875.2s)]
*  our therapies need that component, but they need to be scalable. And so that's the other reason [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2883.7599999999998s)]
*  ultimately they need to be scaled, to be cultureable. And we believe so a co-cultured [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2888.7999999999997s)]
*  approach to growing them together is the only way that's economically possible. So going back to [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2894.08s)]
*  the business, you can't have a hundred, 150 bioreactors, it's not economically possible. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2898.8s)]
*  So to grow them together is, is the only way that you're going to get [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2904.5600000000004s)]
*  efficacy. So sufficient diversity to have those emergent functions and be able to produce it at a [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2909.6800000000003s)]
*  low cost of production. And so from first principles, the two things that we, we wanted, we, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2915.36s)]
*  we worked toward, and essentially that's what that's, you know, we could go back to why did you [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2920.5600000000004s)]
*  quit your job? Well, that's it, because you get that breakthrough, then I believe we, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2923.92s)]
*  we can actually make it a meaningful impact globally with, with, with those, those, those two [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2928.64s)]
*  elements. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm reminded of a, of a quote, he didn't make it up, but he likes to say [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2936.8s)]
*  it. My friend, Alan Shaw, frequent guest on the show, you know, he likes to say, in God we trust, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2946.08s)]
*  all others bring data. And it, and it sounds like in this conversation, conversations I've had with [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2952.08s)]
*  the leaders of other microbiome companies, there's a lot of data, like there's a lot of compelling, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2957.2799999999997s)]
*  compelling data in multiple indications that point to the value, right, of this market and the work [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2962.72s)]
*  that's being done there, the research. And yet, you know, as I noted early, it's been a tough [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2971.68s)]
*  go for a lot of companies in this space. Why? Like what's your take on, on why that is? Is it, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2977.36s)]
*  you know, I don't know, I could, I could, I could pause it. I don't want to put words in your mouth. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2983.92s)]
*  I know it's tough for everybody right now. You know, there are a lot of study areas, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2988.32s)]
*  biologic therapeutics that are, that are suffering, but what's, what's your take on why it's, why it's [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2993.04s)]
*  been a tough go for, for the space of late? Yeah, that's a good question, man. I think it's the [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=2997.92s)]
*  confluence of factors. So as you say, I mean, I mean, biotech is hard. I mean, it is hard and [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3003.44s)]
*  there are, no, not all companies are going to succeed. So that, I mean, that's a background. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3010.8s)]
*  And then there's these, these other backgrounds that affected all fields, you know, recently with [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3016.08s)]
*  funding being difficult at that period in, you know, 2020, 2021, very low interest rates, a lot [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3019.68s)]
*  of money coming in and then that all drying up. And so that's affected everyone. And that's [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3027.2000000000003s)]
*  certainly affecting companies here. You did mention hype as well. I mean, that, that, that, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3031.76s)]
*  that, that, that is a factor. I mean, for the reasons we've talked about, there's genuine [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3037.6800000000003s)]
*  reason for hype. I mean, there is a massive problem and we're seeing that solutions are possible, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3042.8s)]
*  but then there is a whole lot of science and as you say, data and execution and getting it right, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3050.1600000000003s)]
*  that's important. And so that story as to why this is an important therapeutic realm is true, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3058.56s)]
*  I think, but that can lead to hype and the reasons for success come not only from that background, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3066.32s)]
*  but also the execution. And so that is, that is a hard thing. I mean, it doesn't, you know, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3074.7200000000003s)]
*  there's been many cases of this in the, in the, in the past, you know, there's a dot com boom. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3082.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. It didn't mean that the future of commerce didn't involve the internet. I mean, so, so because [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3087.04s)]
*  of the hype at that time, and it didn't mean that Amazon wasn't a good company. So it's just that [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3093.92s)]
*  actually working out how to do this right is, is, is hard. And the microbiome is incredibly complex. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3100.8s)]
*  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's a complex ecosystem. So, you know, the, the, the, the, um, there are a [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3106.96s)]
*  number of factors specific to this area. We talked about that therapeutic paradigm of trying to [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3114.16s)]
*  reduce it to an individual strain. That, that is that, that, that we're, we're traditional, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3120.0s)]
*  say small molecule drug discovery has a set, set pathway. The microbiome doesn't, I mean, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3130.24s)]
*  the release assays are different. How you, how you, how you culture the organisms is different. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3136.64s)]
*  Even on the donor drive space, there are a whole lot of complexities there. There's wild differences [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3144.16s)]
*  batch to batch between the composition. Um, and so that's all had to be discussed with regulators. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3149.2s)]
*  All of these difficult, all these, um, complexities mean that you can't just plug and play like for us, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3154.96s)]
*  uh, a small molecule company could. And so a lot of the companies that have had difficulty have done [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3161.52s)]
*  a lot of hard work, a lot of important work, and it really set a lot of the foundations for, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3166.72s)]
*  for others. And I think, um, you know, I've got a lot of respect for many of the companies and [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3171.52s)]
*  people involved in these companies who have done a lot of really incredible work actually. Um, and, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3177.84s)]
*  and, uh, and I don't think it's not, all of that hasn't gone in vain. I mean, a lot of these things [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3183.76s)]
*  we and others can, can then can build on, um, for instance, the, the education with, with, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3190.2400000000002s)]
*  with regulators around the world that their, their understanding of the, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3197.2s)]
*  how the, um, these therapies might work, how they might be regulated, um, things like, you know, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3201.2799999999997s)]
*  that are required, say, so release assets and these things that's, that's evolved [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3208.16s)]
*  due to a lot of the work, some of these other companies have already done. So, yeah, I mean, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3212.48s)]
*  it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a difficult field and there's a whole lot of, um, other factors at play. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3217.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned, I mean, you know, you talked about the fact that the finance, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3222.8799999999997s)]
*  the financial markets are difficult for, for everyone, regardless of your, your, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3228.4s)]
*  the indication you're going after or the modality that you're developing. Um, is that a more pointed [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3232.08s)]
*  perhaps in this space where, you know, like even you mentioned small molecule grade example, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3238.0s)]
*  but even biologics, you know, development of antibodies, I'm not going to simplify it. I'm [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3242.72s)]
*  not going to dumb it down. It's very complex work, but it's, it's been, it's been done over [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3246.7999999999997s)]
*  and over again. You know, your culturing cells, your manipulating cells to attack a specific target [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3250.72s)]
*  that, you know, will allegedly do a specific thing. It's not an easy case to make, but it's a, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3257.04s)]
*  it's a pretty point blank case to make. Um, if you can get past toxicities and other, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3262.64s)]
*  and other things like the investment community is going to go, at least a good part of the investment [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3268.08s)]
*  community is going to go like, okay, that's relatable. We've seen that we've seen it work [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3272.48s)]
*  before we funded companies that have seen success in those spaces. So we're going to go with it. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3277.36s)]
*  Here, we're talking about something that is considerably more complex, certainly looks [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3281.36s)]
*  a lot different than the intravenous administration of, of an antibody for, for one example. Um, so [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3287.28s)]
*  does that affect sort of the, the investor paradigm? Is it like a, a more finite pool of, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3293.6800000000003s)]
*  of investors or, or even far, you know, big pharma companies who might be interested in [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3300.8s)]
*  getting behind this work or am I just making that up in my head? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3306.72s)]
*  Well, I think, I think it's, it is a little more niche. Yeah. Yeah. And, and I think that, look, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3311.3599999999997s)]
*  I think, um, there is, it's a funny thing investment, isn't it? Because when, when, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3318.16s)]
*  when there's most fear in the market and sentiment is most strongly against, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3325.44s)]
*  then in hindsight, often that's the best time to have invested, you know, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3329.68s)]
*  when there are good underlying fundamentals, you know, that's like value investors. That's what [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3333.52s)]
*  they do. So, so it's not, I, we have approved therapies in this space, both in the U S and, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3338.6400000000003s)]
*  and Australia. So, you know, regulators have accepted these therapies. That's, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3346.96s)]
*  that's de-risked the field massively. These therapies are donor derived therapies. They [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3351.52s)]
*  are different batch to batch in their composition. That's a big thing to have acknowledged that. Um, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3356.56s)]
*  and, and that fact has significantly de-risked the field, because if you then go to develop a [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3363.84s)]
*  culture therapy, even if it's a complex culture therapy, and you don't have, um, uh, perfect [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3369.36s)]
*  batch to batch variation, like a molecule of aspirin, you, this, this precedent set that this [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3376.1600000000003s)]
*  is, this is acceptable, this is acknowledged, this is a part of what these therapies are. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3381.84s)]
*  And we not, not only are they approved, but these are highly effective therapies. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3387.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, so say for C. diff, you're looking at a Delta of 50% absolute gain over the previous standard of [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3391.6800000000003s)]
*  care. That's almost unheard of. It's a huge gain. And, and say in ulcerative colitis, the FM, FMT [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3399.6800000000003s)]
*  studies, like the study I did, part of my PhD, that the remission rates, uh, clinical endoscopic [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3405.84s)]
*  remission rates are in, in range 30, 40%. This, this is similar to the most potent available [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3412.8s)]
*  biological cadence. So, so there is, there are strong fundamentals here. And the other thing, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3419.68s)]
*  Matt, which, which is critical is that we've co-evolved with these organisms. So, so, so, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3425.9199999999996s)]
*  so these, these organisms are part of us and are required by us to perform it, uh, to, to, to, to, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3432.7999999999997s)]
*  to, um, to, to be safe, to, to not to, to be, um, uh, healthy, sorry. And, and therefore they, um, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3438.7999999999997s)]
*  and, and so the, the safety profile for these, uh, uh, to these therapies is actually very good. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3446.08s)]
*  And I believe that's because essentially we, we, we co-evolved with, with the organisms, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3451.68s)]
*  then they're not, they're not blocking an aberrant pathway, like a lot of, say, small molecules or [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3457.6s)]
*  biologics do with downstream flow on effects. Like you, you know, if you're blocking an immune [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3462.56s)]
*  pathway, you have an immune system for a reason. And so, and so these therapies are restorative. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3467.68s)]
*  They're not, they're not, uh, blocking, um, function. And so they, they have a number of [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3473.84s)]
*  advantages. Yes, they're a new paradigm, but that paradigm has many advantages over, over, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3479.84s)]
*  over alternative therapies. And, and so, and so I think we'll look back at this time as, as, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3486.56s)]
*  as a wonderful opportunity because we got through, um, we got through the difficulties and we, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3493.84s)]
*  we had recently have approved therapies. These therapies work, they're, they're life saving, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3502.48s)]
*  life changing. And, and, and we can expand on that now with, with, with these culture versions [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3509.52s)]
*  that are, that are more scalable, can be more consistent in composition, better able to be [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3515.2s)]
*  patented, say all of these advantages, typical advantages you want of, um, of, of a therapeutic. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3519.84s)]
*  So I just, I just think it's, um, it is a, it's an exciting time and, and we'll come out the other [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3526.32s)]
*  side. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's fantastic. Given, so the, the, the, the advantage I should say [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3531.68s)]
*  of having a commercial product aside, what, what else is like, what, what have you found as a leader [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3539.8399999999997s)]
*  of Biobank? What have you found to be, um, productive and, and, and useful in, in sort [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3545.9199999999996s)]
*  of the perseverance to an otherwise difficult time? Like, is there anything Biobank's doing, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3551.04s)]
*  you know, that you would say is, um, contributing to your, uh, yeah, contributing to your perseverance? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3556.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, look, I think, I mean, coming from the clinic where we started, I mean, we, we, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3566.72s)]
*  we, we went straight to an indication where we was an urgent need. And so, and now we derive some, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3572.96s)]
*  you know, revenue from that, that we can, we can help sustain the company from. I think that was, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3579.44s)]
*  that was an advantage. Um, the other thing is, I mean, perversely, you talk, you talked about the [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3584.08s)]
*  access to capital. So that, that's less, we were less able to get huge amounts of money, um, as, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3589.2799999999997s)]
*  as, you know, maybe we could have accessed if we were positioned, uh, overseas, overseas and some [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3595.2s)]
*  other places. But, but, but, but, so that, that focus on being extremely diligent with what you [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3600.88s)]
*  have, I suppose, um, is, is forced on us because of, because of that, that relative situation. And, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3606.56s)]
*  and I suppose in a downturn that, that actually is an advantage, um, in, in that sense. Um, and so, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3612.24s)]
*  and so I suppose those things, and also, um, um, yeah, so I would, I would, I would say, I mean, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3621.04s)]
*  also we've just been lucky with the investors we've had that been, um, been, been fantastic, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3629.9199999999996s)]
*  um, to this point, very, very supportive. Um, and I suppose we've really focused our programs, they, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3636.72s)]
*  they are, they are, um, small relative to, um, a lot of, you know, far bigger pro, uh, companies, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3643.52s)]
*  but we've, we've really focused on, uh, leveraging the product we have. And then on this, on, on our [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3651.2s)]
*  second generation product, really thinking from first principles, how it would be, uh, be, be, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3658.16s)]
*  be able to be as effective as, as, or more effective than the donor drive therapies and, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3666.16s)]
*  and, and scalable. So when you don't have a lot of resources, you, you, you definitely have to, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3671.2799999999997s)]
*  have to, have to think, I suppose it was, it was a New Zealand physicist, Ernest Rutherford, and he [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3676.56s)]
*  said, oh, we don't have the money, so we have to think. So there was a bit of that as well. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3681.8399999999997s)]
*  I like that. That's it. Yeah. I'm going to add that one to the repertoire. That's a, that's a [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3686.7999999999997s)]
*  good one. And I find it interesting. You're, you're Australian, you're quoting a New Zealand [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3690.16s)]
*  physicist. I thought there was like some sort of, uh, like inherent, uh, friction between [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3695.52s)]
*  Australians and New Zealanders. I don't know. Is that, is that just like a stereotype that [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3700.56s)]
*  we Americans have, have, have adopted? No, it certainly is. It certainly is. I think, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3705.68s)]
*  I think, yeah, yeah, we're the, um, I suppose it was like the America, Canada thing. Um, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3710.88s)]
*  yeah. Okay. And, uh, yeah, the hockey games. So we, we, so we, we get beaten up by New Zealand, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3716.4s)]
*  that rugby in my state, we don't, we don't play rugby. So it's played on the, um, a couple of [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3721.68s)]
*  states in Australia and New Zealand are far, far better than us despite being a much smaller [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3727.44s)]
*  country. So, um, yeah, there's that, there's that, there's definitely a rivalry there, but also, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3732.24s)]
*  you know, we, we, we also have, there's a lot of similarities, cultural similarities. I mean, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3738.16s)]
*  and I noticed that in the U S with it, there's a lot of similarities between Australia and the [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3743.04s)]
*  say U S and Canada say, um, as well. So we, we, we definitely share a lot. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3748.0s)]
*  Yeah. Um, all right. I'm, I, I'm getting to the point where I'm abusing your time. I know we've [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3752.8s)]
*  gone long here. Uh, so I want to be respectful of that. And we've covered a lot of ground. I, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3757.2s)]
*  like whenever I have this, I, I really enjoy talking with you, Dr. Costello. I feel like we [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3762.08s)]
*  could go on and on. Um, so I, I, I'll always offer the opportunity to do a part two and maybe dig a [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3766.4s)]
*  little deeper into some of the moves that you guys are making. Um, but I guess we'll just wrap [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3771.68s)]
*  things up by, by, by allowing me to ask you what, like what, what the next big step might be or [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3776.72s)]
*  what you're most excited about for, uh, the, the imminent future of Biobank. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3781.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So, yeah, thanks, Matt. I've really loved having talked to you and, and actually listening [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3788.8799999999997s)]
*  to you for a long period of time has really helped, um, helped me a lot and helped us. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyylcDstmWQ&t=3794.24s)]
