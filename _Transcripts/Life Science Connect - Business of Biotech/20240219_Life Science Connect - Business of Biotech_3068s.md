Video Description: While you might be aware that Sail Biomedicines was just formed up in Q4 of last year, the product of Flagship Pioneering’s decision to merge Senda Biosciences and Laronde, two of its programmable medicine platform companies. What you likely haven’t heard is the inside story on how the merger was executed, how the two companies are integrating their talent, IP, and resources, and what Sail Biomedicines CEO Dr. Guillaume Pfefer and team are currently doing to take the fruits of the company’s platform into the clinic. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, Dr. Pfefer takes us under the hood of Sail Biomedicines and its mission to marry evolution and AI to develop programmable medicines based on eRNA.

*  On my swing through San Francisco, I had the pleasure of sitting down to record episodes [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=40.08s)]
*  with a handful of flagship pioneering CEO partners, including today's guest, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Sal Biomedicine CEO, Dr. Guillaume Pfeffer. You're likely aware that Sal was just formed up in Q4 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=49.44s)]
*  of last year, the product of Flagship's decision to merge Send to Biosciences and Laurent, two of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=56.32s)]
*  its programmable medicine platform companies. What you likely haven't heard is the inside story [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=62.72s)]
*  and how the merger was executed, how the two companies are integrating their talent, IP, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=68.64s)]
*  and resources, and what Dr. Pfeffer and team are currently doing to take the fruits of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=73.68s)]
*  company's platform into the clinic. I'm Matt Piller. This is the business of biotech. And [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=78.72s)]
*  on today's episode, we're getting under the hood of Sal Biomedicines with Dr. Guillaume Pfeffer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=84.0s)]
*  Let's give it a listen. When did you come here from France? 23 years ago. 23 years. Yeah. Well, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=89.04s)]
*  you're holding onto that accent nicely. I know. I'm not sure if I would die with the accent, but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=96.56s)]
*  I decided to become American. The kids speak beautiful, beautiful accent English, but I [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=102.8s)]
*  would try with my wife with some very thick French accent. Yeah. I know a lot of folks who [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=109.6s)]
*  have come over from various places who have lost it over time. For some reason, it's not in me. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  That's good. Hang on to that. I don't have a choice. I'm going to ask you questions about you [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=121.36s)]
*  and how you got into science and that kind of thing in a bit, but I want to start [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=129.12s)]
*  with the more recent news. Well, we'll start with the Q4 news. So in Q4, flagship, which by the way, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=134.4s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of flagship. Great. Yeah. As someone who covers the space, it's just such a target-rich [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=142.8s)]
*  environment and the people are terrific, friendly, easy to work with, transparent. So good company. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=150.08s)]
*  There's a ton of energy at the ecosystem and we are fearless when it comes to trying to make an [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=156.0s)]
*  impact in this world. Not only on the Earth side, but you're probably aware of the sustainability [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=161.52s)]
*  effort. We're also looking to get into sustainability of pesticide and insecticide and contribute to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  Earth health and not only human health. So I'm very excited by how bold and wild we are in our [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=173.44s)]
*  views of bringing science to the benefit of humanity and Earth. So it's exciting to be part [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=180.56s)]
*  of the ecosystem. Certainly it is. Yeah. So in Q4 last year, it was Senda and Laurent, right? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=187.52s)]
*  That's right. Combined to form Cell Biomedicines. So let's start there. What was the back story? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=195.68s)]
*  We were just talking about being bold and believe in science and having a fearless and big ambition [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=201.68s)]
*  of making an impact in humankind. We have come to the realization of being in the field as [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=209.52s)]
*  flagship for quite some time, but we are as an industry on a brink of transforming deeply what [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  we can do for patients with free program of medicine. If you looked at the arc of industry, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  we've been as an industry trying to do more with regard to raising the productivity [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=230.72s)]
*  for discovery to development to license products through different ways. The last one we've [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=235.44s)]
*  accessing the genetic codes and building companies such as Moderna. That program today, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=242.24s)]
*  part of medicine, in the case of Moderna and RNA, but you can feel open island with SIRNA. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=249.28s)]
*  You can mention obviously BioNTech and now Pfizer on the mRNA side, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=255.36s)]
*  just announced we have first CRISPR medicine on the market also coming from this era of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  programming molecule, but we just cannot program medicine just yet, but it's just a matter of time [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=266.72s)]
*  now. It's not a matter of if anymore. With that context in mind and knowing that we've been [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=272.64s)]
*  in this biotech industry for quite some time and contributing and leading some of this transformation, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=278.16s)]
*  we come to the realization that we had in the portfolio already the maturing technology that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=284.32s)]
*  if combined could create this acceleration into the future into this era of program of medicine. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  We made a bold move to combine two of the largest and most promising companies, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=299.2s)]
*  La Ronde and Sender Biosciences, decided to put it together because they have reached the maturity [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  and we thought the time had come to play a very big move into accelerating our industry into the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=312.24s)]
*  era of program of medicine. I will give you much more of the technology of stacking if you want, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=318.8s)]
*  or science advanced into that for sure. Maybe one word and one sentence more exactly that summarize [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=324.64s)]
*  the bold ambition here is the vision statement of the company that now you can appreciate with [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=334.8s)]
*  what I'm telling you with regard to his arc of the industry that led us to his [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=341.28s)]
*  industry being at the verge of fully program of medicine. The statement for vision is generating [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  too more medicine today through the language of life. And we're seeing medicine not just part of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  medicine and we're not even aspiration looking at discovering, but generating give you a sense of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  productivity, predictability, acceleration of number of programs that can move. And actually, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  and we're very excited diversity of disease that can get into down the road. So very big move, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  amazing opportunity. And we hope to be contributing to making this industry a more productive one with [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=381.35999999999996s)]
*  free program of medicine. Amazing opportunity, but a lot of work too. I mean, anytime you bring two [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=386.96s)]
*  companies together, there are going to be things that are there in abundance, maybe too much, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  and they're going to be things that are missing. So let's talk from your leadership perspective, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=396.8s)]
*  let's talk a little bit about that. What was, we'll start with maybe the upshot, what was [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=400.88s)]
*  synergistic and what did you have in abundance by bringing the company together? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=408.0s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. Well, what do I think that I can tell you is it makes sense for [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  everybody involved, board member, all of the investor, of course, ecosystem and decision [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=418.16s)]
*  maker and flagship, but also the team. And I'm mentioning the team last, but importantly, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=424.56s)]
*  as you merge company, it doesn't make sense. You're fighting against, it doesn't make sense [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=429.44s)]
*  to put these things together. In this case, half of the battle is already won because for everybody [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=435.44s)]
*  involved, it makes sense. Why it makes sense? Because we are synergistic, more than overlapping. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=441.12s)]
*  One company was advanced with one of the best next generation RNA proposition on market with [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=448.88s)]
*  circular RNA that we call that endless RNA. We're going to give you much more details about it, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=456.0s)]
*  but it's explained the formation of RNA vastly beyond what is forward today with inner RNA. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=461.36s)]
*  This company was looking at delivery of RNA, which is the basic LNP that again, we can maybe [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=467.76s)]
*  back to the future. So, commoditized delivery, very advanced RNA with endless RNA on one side, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=474.08s)]
*  which is the lateral side. The center side, we had exactly the opposite. A very novel way to [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  actually program deployment of RNA or delivery of RNA with very commoditized mRNA technology attached [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=487.76s)]
*  to it. All together now, we have the most comprehensive and most advanced entirely [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  programmable RNA medicine in the industry with linear RNA, circular RNA, LNP, and natural nanoparticle [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=501.68s)]
*  all together. So, that makes sense. Where we have actually synergies, some of these positions, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=511.36s)]
*  obviously that's why we added redundancy and we've been able to organize ourselves to move [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=518.0s)]
*  through that transition quite swiftly. And we are now very much in position of executing [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=523.6s)]
*  integration. Fremont Fin is almost behind us at this stage and we're quite excited to be going [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=529.52s)]
*  after it makes sense, the vision that we all have and put our energy into building more than integrating. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=535.52s)]
*  So, the battle is won when you have actually a purpose that makes sense for everybody and I'm [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=542.0s)]
*  quite excited to see that everywhere in the organization. You use the key word integration. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=548.64s)]
*  So, when two companies merge, integration needs to happen at every level. Systems like operating [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=555.04s)]
*  systems, office systems, people. And when that integration happens, that's where sometimes [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=561.52s)]
*  what's missing reveals itself. That's where the sweat equity comes in. You got to roll up your sleeve [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=568.16s)]
*  and make things happen. So, walk us through that. When you began that integration of the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  companies in earnest, well, two-part question. I'd like to know what it looks like. I mean, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=579.8399999999999s)]
*  did you bring these people and facilities physically together? And then two, how did you [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=584.56s)]
*  muscle through that actual marriage? I'm married. I know you got to muscle. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=591.3599999999999s)]
*  I have. It is the work of every day on both sides of the table. I'm not going to play [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  the team here. It's a work that requires a two-way collaboration, which actually brings me to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=603.76s)]
*  something which is important here is when you have a common sense of purpose that is clear for [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=610.16s)]
*  everybody and you manage to unite energy behind it, again, you cover a lot of very necessary [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=614.88s)]
*  energy that you need to absorb the change and have people, including myself, involved in two-phase [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  transaction and integration, putting the extra effort to bring it together because you believe [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  it. You believe in what we're trying to do. So, that was very important to appreciate as we [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=635.36s)]
*  announced to the team, both company announced at the same time to bring you into the story and [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=640.4s)]
*  what happened exactly that day where we make the announcement. We engaged separately with two teams, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=645.12s)]
*  explained that we were merging and brought the same data, two teams together and celebrated [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=651.76s)]
*  and started asking the question and of course, starting with our own energy beyond the purpose [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=658.32s)]
*  and realizing we had won that battle. It makes sense for everybody we talked to. I went through [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=663.44s)]
*  another merger situation at the start of my journey with Flagship where it was making not as much a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=670.24s)]
*  sense. It had to fight for months and months, actually more than a year to be able to even [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=679.12s)]
*  reshape the vision to ignite the energy of one team behind one single purpose. Here, it was [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=685.44s)]
*  pretty clear for everybody. So, now, of course, you have a mini-gritty of integrating system. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=693.28s)]
*  We have, of course, two different systems. We have two different human resource policies. We have a [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  bunch of legal policies and documents that needed to be harmonized. Where can I go? We have two sites [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=705.3599999999999s)]
*  and we won one site. All of that is certainly being done and prosecuted today, but again, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=713.5999999999999s)]
*  by a team of people that believe in the mission and want to get at it and actually want to get [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=719.68s)]
*  done with it as fast as you can to move forward into building the company. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=725.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah. When you're trying to do great things in science and in medicine and you have a [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=730.8s)]
*  disruptive business challenge to solve, i.e. a merger, just give us some...pretend like you're [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=738.16s)]
*  speaking to someone who is on the cusp of seeing that for the first time. Some advice on how to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=746.24s)]
*  maintain that mission-driven focus and not lose sight of that while you're distracted by this [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=753.76s)]
*  disruption of the merger. So, I'm aware of the sense of purpose, which I think is absolutely [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=760.64s)]
*  tricky. So, I'm going to put it on the side and get into another key element, directness, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=766.16s)]
*  transparency, or communication and over-communicating. You have to make yourself and the leadership [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=772.08s)]
*  team available to the entire team. And it has to be a two-way street as far as delivering what we're [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=778.64s)]
*  trying to do and receiving from the team what they are actually experiencing. You also need to build [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  these highly collaborative, which we have been in the two companies. So, that was a very nice [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=791.6s)]
*  meeting place, but it has to be a collaborative work all the way. You just cannot integrate from [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=796.64s)]
*  the top down. You have to put it into a gauge and you don't want bystander but sit in the arena [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=802.3199999999999s)]
*  and look at what's going on on the field. You want everybody to basically get at it. So, now from that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=808.16s)]
*  it becomes harnessing the energy of people willing to put the extra effort to get it done with [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=814.9599999999999s)]
*  integration while actually keeping building the organization. So, the key additional point that I [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=820.16s)]
*  want to bring to you beside a very strong sense of purpose and make sure that everybody sees [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=825.6s)]
*  is directness, transparency, and over-communication and creating a very, at least my style as a leader, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=830.88s)]
*  highly collaborative engagement that gives a voice to everybody and creates these ways to listen [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=839.52s)]
*  to everybody, especially when you bring new team members coming from two different organizations. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=847.28s)]
*  Actually, we have to work together. So, the sooner you start this processing or listening [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=852.64s)]
*  and discovering each other and respecting what everybody brings to the table and engage this team [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=858.08s)]
*  to building together the company that we have now decided to merge is another critical part of what [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=864.0s)]
*  you hope to be kept as we move from integration to building the company, collaborative work. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=870.64s)]
*  How many people are involved in the new one? Right now, we are about a little bit less than [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=878.88s)]
*  200 people, which is significantly higher than what we had on two companies. And of course, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=884.16s)]
*  I bring the challenge of two sites. And we have now announced actually that we can be moving in [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=890.24s)]
*  one single site, which I'm really looking forward to because it's going to continue to jam the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=895.6s)]
*  organization to one organization to be in one single site. Right now, what I'm very happy to see [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=900.72s)]
*  as I go into the two different sites of the legacy company, I'm seeing a familiar face from [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=906.56s)]
*  one company in the other site and vice versa. So, I'm already seeing that this highly collaborative [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=911.8399999999999s)]
*  work is already happening on the ground. And I just cannot wait to see everybody on the one roof. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=919.3599999999999s)]
*  Fortunately, we made the decision now that we're going to be in one single site and [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  already preparing to move. Yeah. Will you utilize one of the existing facilities? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  It's going to be a new one for us, but one that is very well known in the ecosystem and flagship, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  which is also one of the things that I want to bring to the table is being part of this ecosystem [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=940.56s)]
*  is absolutely invaluable in so many dimensions, including site selection and the ability to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=945.4399999999999s)]
*  quite quickly bring a team into one fantastic site with a lot of capabilities and amenities that [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  are needed to propel science into a product and medicine for patients, obviously. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=961.2s)]
*  Why were you chosen to be the leader of the new entity? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=969.28s)]
*  It's a tough question. I can use it as a positive or negative. One way to answer [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=976.08s)]
*  your question by question is why me? I'm not insinuating that's a question you ask yourself [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=985.84s)]
*  every morning when you wake up. You can get into a little bit of your background if you'd like. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=995.2s)]
*  You came to flagship in 2020, is that correct? 2020, yeah. As a partner and CEO, being a partner, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1001.9200000000001s)]
*  which is how we set up this role now to be CEO and partner, get you to precisely be able to be [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1009.84s)]
*  involved in looking at the full ecosystem. When we saw opportunities, we can have a voice and engage [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1016.88s)]
*  the rest of the ecosystem at flagship to see how we could collaborate between companies, for instance. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1025.04s)]
*  In this case, good companies together. I do remember that I had that discussion more than a year [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1032.32s)]
*  ago that it may make sense to bring these two companies together. We were probably over thinking [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1037.92s)]
*  that the combination was so extraordinarily synergistic, but at the right time, it would [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1043.2s)]
*  have made sense to do it. As we went through the process, again, in a very collaborative way [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1048.72s)]
*  with several colleagues in the flagship ecosystem, I could have been dropped from being the CEO of [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1054.16s)]
*  the organizations. I feel very humbled and entrusted and fortunate to be continuing the [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1060.16s)]
*  journey in this major organization for sure, but it had made sense for quite some time and we had [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1066.8s)]
*  a long ways into putting these companies together. Maybe what I bring to the table, especially in [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  these circumstances of igniting energy and being contagious, but I believe that the after-sulking [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1079.2s)]
*  rates is needed. I get that sense very much. It's very, your enthusiasm is... I am. It's only one [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1085.44s)]
*  life. We're trying to live it with fun and impact and we're so fortunate to be in this industry where [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1092.56s)]
*  the impact is better in life for everybody, including ourselves, when we get to the part [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1098.56s)]
*  of becoming patient. For sure. Yeah. As I mentioned, you were with GSK prior to coming to flagship. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1104.0s)]
*  What prompted the move from... I always ask this question. It's not uncommon at all for executives [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1111.9199999999998s)]
*  to leave big bio for new emerging, exciting opportunities, but at the same time, regardless [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1118.4s)]
*  of the fact that it's not uncommon, it's still leaving a very relatively safe place where [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1124.96s)]
*  you can stay there for life if you wanted to. What was in you that prompted you to join flagship? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1133.0400000000002s)]
*  It's the second time I'm doing it. I was raised at Sanofi or what had become Sanofi from [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1140.5600000000002s)]
*  Ronde Poulain-Caventis, Sanofi. I then jumped into a biotech and brought back to the industry. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1146.48s)]
*  Maybe despite what I really wanted to do, I was very happy in this small, fast moving environment, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1152.48s)]
*  but I discovered all of my 15 years at Sanofi with my first biotech, but I could see the impact. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1160.88s)]
*  We would make a GSK and we can come back to that, which is very unique opportunity we had. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1168.16s)]
*  But after four years, I was really looking at getting back to something a little bit more speedy [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1174.0s)]
*  if you want and energy. I think to me, having done it twice, the balance is, and it's a little bit of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1180.16s)]
*  a pendulum. I think we've said we're getting into something else that I didn't experience before [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1187.1200000000001s)]
*  because of the size of the organization and the capital available to the organization. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1193.1200000000001s)]
*  But you're trading impact for speed. In my own experience, having done it twice, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1200.24s)]
*  big impact in large pharma, especially when you get into the late stage commercialization, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1206.96s)]
*  close to market, close to patient. The science that's emerged from externally or internally [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1214.96s)]
*  become a way to impact massively shareholders and patient obviously. And you in biotech, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1220.64s)]
*  most of us are stuck in the early stage before most of us failing and a few of us [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1229.2800000000002s)]
*  after another 10, 15 years having the chance to put one product maybe on a market platform company [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1236.0800000000002s)]
*  has much more to offer, but very few have multiple products going to. So you have speed, but without [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1242.4s)]
*  the impact on biotech and you have absolutely not speed, but beautiful impact on the pharma side of [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1248.0800000000002s)]
*  it. At least from my experience, I don't want to claim that it is a general rule, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1256.0s)]
*  but it's what I experience. So I've been a little bit in this pendulum and I'm very happy with [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1260.3200000000002s)]
*  my opportunity to have joined a flagship to be back to speed. And with sales, I really think we [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1266.96s)]
*  have impacted speed in one single company and I'm really looking forward to impacting the industry [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1274.0800000000002s)]
*  with this transformation into fully programable medicine. And I want to do that with speed, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1280.32s)]
*  which is the tomorrow medicine today, which is actually indicating a very strong sense of [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1286.48s)]
*  urgency. Why patients will wait to be treated. If you could bring science to them, why don't we [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1292.8799999999999s)]
*  try to do it faster, increasing the predictability of the outcome, which is solving for their needs. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1300.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You mentioned your time in Sanofi and from what I understand, you spent quite a bit of that [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1306.4s)]
*  time, or at least a portion of that time in Mexico. That's right. You're French, obviously. So you [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1314.24s)]
*  did work in France. Now you're in the States. You've been all over the world and I worked all [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1319.36s)]
*  over the world in this industry. And I remember I had Avakavijian on the show a few months ago. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1324.32s)]
*  He's wonderful. He's fantastic. And he spent quite a bit of time talking about the immigration [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1331.44s)]
*  mentality and that culture at Flagship. I mean, you sort of have that in space given that you've [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1336.0800000000002s)]
*  done work all over the world in this industry. How does that sort of shape that global perspective, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1343.28s)]
*  shape your leadership style? Why is it important? Yeah. First, I'm also an immigrant to these [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1349.28s)]
*  countries. Maybe like back at many others, including one in the US, past generation, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1355.28s)]
*  we're discussing about your route as well. Either way, being immigrant and first generation [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1361.84s)]
*  bring you in that space where you need to somewhat reinvent yourself. From my experience, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1368.08s)]
*  besides being an immigrant and first generation in the US, my experience in Mexico, for instance, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1374.1599999999999s)]
*  and also professionally, and I would also bring my start in the US, there's something very, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1380.9599999999998s)]
*  again, for me that happened as I put myself in a totally different environment, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1389.44s)]
*  starting with, and it was Mexico, but it was the US somewhat. I would use Mexico as an example. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1396.0s)]
*  No language. You don't know the food. You don't know the people. You don't know the culture. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1403.52s)]
*  You start, you have two ways to do it. You want to bring what you come from into the mix [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1409.68s)]
*  and you're trapped into working and living in an island, which is where you're coming from, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1416.48s)]
*  or you open up and you open up for a pressure of not knowing what to do. And for me, it was exactly [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1423.52s)]
*  what happened in the US as well when I immigrated, I had no clue what I was doing. Language was not [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1430.64s)]
*  so great. I had a very French accent that I lost since, as you could see. But Mexicans, I didn't [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1435.6s)]
*  speak the language even on my first day. And my first day, actually, I was introduced to my [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1442.96s)]
*  predecessor for a firewall party and we had 250 of my future team members in front of me. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1448.16s)]
*  And I was expected to speak in Spanish. I had no clue. And I actually had to decide, am I going [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1456.32s)]
*  to speak in French and English and impose that to them? Or am I going to say, I don't know [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1462.24s)]
*  your language, I'm going to need your help to grow into being able to be part of you and part [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1468.3999999999999s)]
*  of this team. And I decided I use, I remember vividly it was in me and I was somewhat frightened, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1473.76s)]
*  but on the other hand, welcoming the opportunity. And I said, I feel like a baby. I'm going full, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1479.9199999999998s)]
*  reborn into an environment, into a language, into culture that I want to appreciate and go into. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1487.52s)]
*  And it's very refreshing. It gives you probably humility. It gives you a sense that, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  especially in leadership, that you need people more than they need you. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1499.9199999999998s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And you put yourself in that situation. So I've been tested through this [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1504.56s)]
*  several steps and you have to find in you how you address the adversity and the novelty of [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1512.08s)]
*  a situation. And I found my way. It's just my own way of processing and living the experience. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1520.0s)]
*  But it gave me today what I hope to be a very open mind and welcoming mind to any voice. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1527.04s)]
*  I have no problem with diversity. I don't even understand why we're making an issue. I do [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1534.72s)]
*  understand that we're biased, a big problem to solve, but I'm not at all from my experience and [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1538.8s)]
*  bringing coming with a free, hopefully not too many bias. That's probably my bias. But [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1544.48s)]
*  for pressure, his experience, a lot of my initial bias has been broken down into pieces. And I hope [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1552.72s)]
*  I can bring a sense of inclusiveness in the team. And again, if you bring that plus a clear sense [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1559.2s)]
*  of purpose and you have talented experience, industry veteran around you, the sky is the limit. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1565.68s)]
*  Yeah. Well, your English is proving itself right now. How's your Spanish? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1573.28s)]
*  All right. I want to spend some time talking about the technology and the platform. And I [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1587.52s)]
*  guess I preface this part of the conversation with the RNA craze, right? You guys are calling it [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1593.6s)]
*  endless RNA, you know, we've seen circular and RNA. It seems as though, you know, it's sexy right [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1600.96s)]
*  now to put a shape or a letter in front of RNA and go to market. That is not M, like messenger. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1606.48s)]
*  We need another letter, like messenger. Tell me, let's start with that. Let's start with [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1613.8400000000001s)]
*  that sort of a fundamental understanding of why endless RNA. Yeah. Why endless RNA? What is it [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1621.3600000000001s)]
*  why? Yeah. And we answer with a context of programming the entire medicine. It's also [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1628.0800000000002s)]
*  mean that we need to improve the programming of mRNA. We do program mRNA. Don't get me wrong. We [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1634.88s)]
*  can encode through a sequence, the translation and ultimately the secretion of given protein by cells [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1642.3200000000002s)]
*  by virtue of entering a sequence into the construct of the messenger RNA linear. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1651.52s)]
*  But it's act like a switch in and off very fast. So you have a burst of protein express and then [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1657.92s)]
*  you're done, which pharmacologically speaking limits the applicability in term of therapeutic [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1664.0s)]
*  area. You can get into two IOC max to get you in some problem that limit the disease you can get [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1670.72s)]
*  into the quick in and out may not be enough for prolonged expression, but you may need [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1678.48s)]
*  that we say for chronic disease, for instance. What we've done with RNA is adding a dimension [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1684.8s)]
*  of the programmability by prolonging the expression of protein that can still encode into the RNA. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1692.88s)]
*  So we extending the programmability of RNA and improving the therapeutic power of RNA. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1701.44s)]
*  The beauty of what we've done at sales and by combination of these two companies, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1710.08s)]
*  now we're stacking in the same company mRNA and ERNA. We can program for a quick in and out. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1715.04s)]
*  We can also with mRNA, but we can also program a more prolonged and tunable pharmacokinetic [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1723.04s)]
*  by virtue of programming ERNA. But it's only part of the story and I hope we can discuss [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1730.7199999999998s)]
*  about deployment as well, which is also part of the technology of stacking that we have. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1735.76s)]
*  So what I picked up from reading about you was the, you know, you've got these three pillars. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1744.4s)]
*  We were just talking about programmable payloads of endless RNA, programmable [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1749.04s)]
*  nanoparticles and proprietary AI technologies. So the stacking fit in somewhere. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1754.56s)]
*  Absolutely. Because right now what we can do with RNA in general is programming the molecule itself. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1759.92s)]
*  The 15 years there is one of these molecules on the market. So something is missing. We're talking [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1768.16s)]
*  about extending and prolonging the pharmacokinetic of expression of protein that certainly will help [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1773.84s)]
*  accessing over disease area that's the one in vaccines that fortunately we've been able to [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1781.68s)]
*  crack with mRNA. There is something else going on here. We just cannot bring RNA to the right cell. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1788.0s)]
*  And that is where we have also by virtue of programming, brought another programmable solution. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1794.96s)]
*  But I'm excited to talk to you about it. Let's do it. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1803.68s)]
*  First, everything is sources in nature. So the vision statement is full language of life. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1810.72s)]
*  It's obvious for us today that genetic code gives us the ability to program molecule and send RNA. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1816.48s)]
*  It will be linear or endless RNA as we call it. That's a cell. But we also found in nature [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1822.1599999999999s)]
*  a programming language that help us to deploy the RNA or deliver RNA to different cells [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1830.8799999999999s)]
*  in a programmable way. It turns out species from all kingdom of life have evolved to do [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1838.08s)]
*  what we're trying to do, theoretically speaking, communicate with each other at cellular level. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1844.96s)]
*  Species have evolved to defend themselves, to grow and make their ecosystem vibrant, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1852.08s)]
*  to send molecule to cells to other species in their immediate surrounding. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1857.52s)]
*  True in our own body, we talk about the microbiome as well as one area. There's a lot going on also [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1863.44s)]
*  in the preliminary area. Plants are able to defend themselves by doing exactly that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1870.88s)]
*  as a defense mechanism to inject toxins in cells of the pathogenic attacker. They don't run away. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1877.1200000000001s)]
*  They just have to defend themselves. So if there's inter-species, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  inter-cellular communications everywhere and coming from billions of years of evolution. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1889.7600000000002s)]
*  And when we looked at it, we realized that this communication [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1894.8000000000002s)]
*  are enabled with a nano-sized vesicle secreted by species to enable this communication. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1898.24s)]
*  Guess what? These vesicles are chemically encoded to bring the directionality of the communication, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1904.8s)]
*  targeting the aspect of it, and they repeat those. So what we spent three years doing in one of our [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1912.88s)]
*  legacy companies is extract this molecular composition from natural nano-vesicle coming [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1918.8s)]
*  from five kinder mob life. We have 75,000 absolutely novel molecule at last, but we [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1925.92s)]
*  are systematically built and curated. And we're playing AI and machine learning [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1932.96s)]
*  to this very vast design domain that far exceed what is possible today with synthetic lipid [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1938.72s)]
*  that are being used for classic LNP used for any mRNA medicine today. So we bring these [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1944.0800000000002s)]
*  dimensions all together now. You can program everything about the medicine, RNA deployment, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1952.24s)]
*  so your AI machine learning become integrative generation of medicine, not just generation of [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1960.8799999999999s)]
*  RNA. So now the world of fully-programmed medicine is opening and the idea that we can go faster, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1968.16s)]
*  bring predictability and getting to disease that we cannot go into by the way to bring the RNA or [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1975.68s)]
*  mRNA to cells we cannot reach or repeat those for chronic disease, open water administration, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1981.2800000000002s)]
*  or water administration is not anymore a fiction. It's becoming a reality. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1987.44s)]
*  Yeah. The leap from the scientific part of what you're discussing, molecular discovery [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=1992.64s)]
*  across the animal kingdom to computational biology, AI and machine learning for some companies, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2004.3200000000002s)]
*  for some people, that's a big leap on many fronts, for many facets. I mean, one, you're [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2012.3200000000002s)]
*  marrying science and technology that haven't necessarily played well or at all together [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2022.16s)]
*  historically. So tell me a little bit about that. How have you or how are you at cell [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2029.2s)]
*  integrating those two disciplines of thought? You've got to have computational biologists [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2037.3600000000001s)]
*  and artificial intelligence experts and machine learning folks working in lockstep with scientists [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2042.72s)]
*  who get excited about the discovery of nanoparticles. So how do you manage to do that? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2050.88s)]
*  Yes. We do already have an AI machine learning team embedded into one of our legacy companies [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2057.04s)]
*  has already started to bring the power of these capabilities into the more traditional way to [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2064.0s)]
*  hypothesis driven, experience driven way to discover, turn discovery into generation, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2070.48s)]
*  to computing. And we are bringing this team now to the support of generating [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2077.6s)]
*  transportation and deployment already. And ultimately we want this team to help us to [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2084.64s)]
*  integrate the design and generate the entirety of medicine. There's no reason why to stop at [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2090.24s)]
*  component level. We have to do it like a cell phone in a very integrated level. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2095.28s)]
*  But you're raising a very good question. And here I'm going to tell you that I don't know. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2100.8s)]
*  I've got a panel. You're allowed to tell me what you know. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2107.6s)]
*  But I can also tell you that I checked with several other flagship companies that have already [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2112.1600000000003s)]
*  went through the process and very certainly culture and adaptation to accepting as a scientist, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2117.76s)]
*  a computational scientist coming at you and said, I have a totally different way to think about this [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2124.8s)]
*  problem. And I don't necessarily need to know deeply about the science. I need to be able to [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2130.16s)]
*  have access to the data and sample and explore this very vast design domain that actually you [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2136.64s)]
*  have in front of you. But what you don't have is a lifetime of exploring every single combination [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2142.96s)]
*  and accelerate this process and give you some rules, some handles that get you to understand [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2148.08s)]
*  better what's going on here. It's a bit of a deciphering. I mean, you're decoding if you want, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2153.7599999999998s)]
*  in your case, what is actually available coming from the end of years of revolution. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2160.0s)]
*  I mean, you're going at the generation, the opposite way that we will do with discovery. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2164.96s)]
*  You accept that the solution is probably there. And you're trying to find the right combination [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  of elements, nucleic acid and nanoparticle and natural nanoparticle component that together [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2177.84s)]
*  give you a performance that you're looking at delivering as a medicine. So it's a reverse. Define [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2186.64s)]
*  the performance you want, design to reach performance, which is kind of very interesting. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2192.3199999999997s)]
*  In engineering term, it's something we do all the time because the technology is much more advanced. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2198.16s)]
*  We basically do performance by design everywhere. But in medicine, it's been quite complicated to [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2202.64s)]
*  do that because we're missing knowledge and ability, or we were missing so far, knowledge and [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2208.72s)]
*  ability to explore large design domain, but with AI machine learning and what we're bringing to [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2214.48s)]
*  the table at CEL, we have a very large design domain on both hand. Thinking about the combination, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2220.72s)]
*  it's even faster. And now we're bringing AI to help us decipher and ultimately generate novel medicine. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2226.4s)]
*  Whenever I talk with companies who are deploying AI to work through large data sets and help [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2235.52s)]
*  get closer to the ideal, it's difficult to sit back and imagine in your head, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2244.64s)]
*  okay, the traditional birth of a biopharma company, Biotech, happens this way. And it's [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2251.92s)]
*  kind of easy to follow the continuum. The molecule, the viability of the molecule, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2258.48s)]
*  the CMC assessments and on and on down the line. You introduce a whole lot of molecular data [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2266.64s)]
*  to machine learning and AI, and suddenly you have a company that [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2274.48s)]
*  it's not so easy to follow that trend line. So can you share it? It's sort of a vague question, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2279.04s)]
*  but where you are right now, I want to learn if a pipeline is in the works, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2285.6s)]
*  to the degree that you can share, but sort of give us an idea of where CEL is on that continuum, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2292.64s)]
*  in terms of having a therapeutic. Yeah, absolutely. Maybe stage of a company [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2300.0s)]
*  and what we have the aspiration to deliver in the next, let's say 30 months or so, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2306.72s)]
*  we will be new men in the next 30 months with at least two programs, if not more. We will [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2311.12s)]
*  and have set the objective to nominate five growth candidates in the next 18 months. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2317.84s)]
*  Okay. And as you may have seen, we have engaged [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2323.44s)]
*  through two partnership sales and we're very humbled and excited to be working with these two [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2327.92s)]
*  foundations that represent the best expert and most dedicated foundation against two very important [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2334.56s)]
*  diseases, malaria and CFF, or CF and CFTR. In particular, we have announced the partnering with [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2340.48s)]
*  the GATE Foundation and joined the fight against malaria with two different programs. We like their [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2348.3199999999997s)]
*  commitment. We like their expertise. We want to be part of a journey to make a difference. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2354.7999999999997s)]
*  We're not trying to sample each other with regard to testing one technology or another. We want to [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2359.52s)]
*  make an impact and we're very proud to be part of this partnership and hopefully bring a solution [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2366.72s)]
*  to malaria, which is still a very deadly disease, unfortunately, two few days. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2371.92s)]
*  Then we also have announced the work with the CFF or CFTR with absolutely striking data generated [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2377.92s)]
*  last year with the INA. But to your question, and one of the things that you evoke with your question [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2386.2400000000002s)]
*  is maybe wrongly, but if you invade into your generation AI, you may have to give up somewhat [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2392.56s)]
*  what are you going to generate? That's perceptive because it's actually more concise than the way [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2402.0s)]
*  that I posed that very roundabout question, but that's exactly the point. Which is a good problem [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2411.36s)]
*  to have, right? It is. And the beauty of it is we do have a lot of possibilities from an application [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2416.7200000000003s)]
*  viewpoint. It's kind of amplified with AI, which brings us to the real question, as is for me, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2422.64s)]
*  operating company is number one, do we want to do all of that ourselves? And the answer is absolutely [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2429.36s)]
*  no. And I was going into partnering already with that in mind. We want to work with the best experts [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2437.04s)]
*  and it's going to take a village, mental industry to embrace fully program on medicine. We are one [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2444.8s)]
*  of the many companies that are trying to do it. We are bringing a unique set of technology. We [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2452.56s)]
*  think we have the most comprehensive and entirely program-oriented in medicine, but it's only part [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2459.52s)]
*  of what is needed to solve our patient needs. And we're very humble about the world. So bringing [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2463.92s)]
*  expertise, bringing capabilities we don't have is something that we welcome. So if you think like [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2469.84s)]
*  you can generate whatever is generated and make it available to companies that want to work with [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2477.04s)]
*  you. That's one. But pointing out a problem, which we do have, it's raising another question. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2482.72s)]
*  Where do you want to start? And what area do you want to start with? So here we have a few [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2488.16s)]
*  principles. Number one, anything where the biology is not known at this stage of a company, it's a [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2493.4399999999996s)]
*  risk we don't want to take. So we want to be in front of proving that our technology works on top [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2499.7599999999998s)]
*  of the biology that is the risk. So that is absolutely clear. We may take as we create a [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2505.68s)]
*  portfolio, if you risk on the biology side, but as an overwhelmingly principle for deciding what to [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2511.12s)]
*  bring to human, we're going to avoid to take biology risk. But certainly we want to prove a [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2518.8799999999997s)]
*  platform. We want to prove a platform in multiple axis of value creation. We have opened, and I'm [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2524.48s)]
*  thinking about it for three different things. So if you give me a minute is water administration, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2530.8s)]
*  classically for air and emergency, IV, IEM with vaccine for sure. We are opening right now sub [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2538.96s)]
*  Q and have a line of sight for maybe four. So water administration, proving that the platform [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2545.36s)]
*  works in human by sampling and selecting program that help us to check, check, check, check various [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2552.32s)]
*  water administration. Then we have what we call modality. Where do we express the protein within [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2559.36s)]
*  the cell, outside the cell or the membrane in the cell. Here, let's give us also a way to sample [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2565.52s)]
*  what the technology can do by deciding to sample the by virtue of the program we select is free [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2572.88s)]
*  type of modality. And finally, where do we bring here any, which kind of cells and tissues we can [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2580.0s)]
*  access. And today we can access four different different cells, which when you think about this [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2586.8s)]
*  pre dimension, we have already a lot to do in rare disease, metabolic disease, which is very [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2592.6400000000003s)]
*  unique and chronic disease in general, obviously vaccines, including cancer vaccines. We have [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2598.8s)]
*  started to crack monoclonal antibody encoded into RNA, possibly with sub Q, think about [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2605.44s)]
*  bringing the field of monoclonal antibody, the RNA technology that is already going everywhere [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2611.8399999999997s)]
*  from an application viewpoint. And of course, CFTR is bringing us to the long we found a gene, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2618.8799999999997s)]
*  I would say we play enzyme replacement or approach to a disease, which is welded into a [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2627.04s)]
*  genetic defect. So we are here looking at access to the company, enabling the de-risking of some of [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2632.8799999999997s)]
*  the key features we want to do future medicine more than trying to open one single therapeutic [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2640.72s)]
*  area and becoming the best increase therapeutic area. We will have to pick up a fight going forward [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2647.8399999999997s)]
*  for sure. At this stage, it's a lot about demonstrating that a platform can reach many [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2653.9199999999996s)]
*  different areas and sampling the space at the support of time. I mean, it's not been [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2659.52s)]
*  smooth sailing from a financial market standard in the market. And it seems like a lot of companies [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2666.8s)]
*  are realizing that they've got to have either a bulletproof platform or products to appeal to [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2675.84s)]
*  investors. And more often than not, like from what I'm hearing, product is key. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2683.04s)]
*  Has that been a, I mean, you guys launched in Q4 of last year, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2689.44s)]
*  maybe to sum up the ideal time, although other people have told me the best companies are born [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2696.72s)]
*  in the face of adversity. What's been your experience though, in terms of where the company is [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2702.2400000000002s)]
*  on this phase of its continuum and its reception by the investor market? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2710.48s)]
*  Right. So first we were very well capitalized. The two companies were very well funded. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2716.48s)]
*  So none of these companies had to raise money immediately. So combined, we have the mean and [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2723.44s)]
*  the runway to bring the technology to humans without having to raise money. The partnership [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2728.96s)]
*  that we have announced plus likely another one at least by mid-year will bring us extra [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2734.64s)]
*  non-duty funding to even prolong the runway and open up possibilities from an applications [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2740.8s)]
*  viewpoint and future program viewpoint. It's certainly been very difficult for the entire [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2746.96s)]
*  industry and probably remain for a good part of this year. Not that I have a crystal ball, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2751.2000000000003s)]
*  but it's going to take time to bring back. These things don't generally change with a [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2757.2000000000003s)]
*  foot-on-a-switch. No, it takes a little bit of time, but a few success will bring us back to [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2761.44s)]
*  being confident and excited about what this amazing industry that we're part of can do to [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2766.4s)]
*  patients. And that is going to come back for sure. I have absolutely no doubt. And you're going to [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2771.6s)]
*  see a next generation of technology such as what we're doing at sales by releasing a coming up [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2776.32s)]
*  front page and content center to generate significant value and attract significant [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2781.92s)]
*  capital as well. We don't have to fundraise right now. I think the first pass for us is to [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2787.76s)]
*  attract a partner and work with expert and committed strategic partner. That's one who [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2795.2s)]
*  play along with us and that will bring money in the bank to be very clear, but we don't need right [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2800.72s)]
*  now to raise to deliver our first human. Which again, it's a very invaluable position that very [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2808.48s)]
*  few right by a top of my friend in the industry have right now as a luxury. I do agree with you [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2815.44s)]
*  that it's important to translate. I'm an engineer by background, so maybe my head is into the [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2821.68s)]
*  concrete. I'm a chemical engineer. No, my PhD was in material science. But I'm also part of [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2828.64s)]
*  this industry for impact to patients. And I value and love science, but I want to see science [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2841.52s)]
*  making a difference and being part of this industry translating, building pipeline, and [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2850.96s)]
*  ultimately bringing novel medicine to solve patient needs is what it's all about for all of us, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2856.08s)]
*  I'm quite sure. So it's important for us to demonstrate that we can productize and not only [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2861.76s)]
*  build amazing engine. And that's fortunately where we already are with many different potential [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2866.7200000000003s)]
*  program, great data generated on the application side of it, line of sight for five candidates in [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2874.08s)]
*  the next 18 months, two first human in 30 months. And I'm going to get back to revision is [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2879.92s)]
*  tomorrow medicine today. You made it clear that you want to do these things quickly, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2887.04s)]
*  pixel of speed is tomorrow's medicine today. So you say partnerships are sort of key. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2895.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2903.52s)]
*  Not too concerned about the runway partnerships. You come to a place like San Francisco during JPM. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2905.04s)]
*  What's the goal? Is it sort of explore these partnerships? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2912.3199999999997s)]
*  Loaded with partnership discussion, also investor discussion on or investor already committed to [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2916.24s)]
*  success to having invested in both companies, separate company. We have good support, at least [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2924.4s)]
*  that's how I feel we are based on the reception as we process through the transaction. We have [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2930.08s)]
*  enthusiastic support behind this transaction. It makes sense for everybody, including our investors. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2936.48s)]
*  So I think we're invested probably looking at, no, what I want to see that moving in the right [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2941.36s)]
*  direction. I want to see program and data and that's exactly what I want to see as well. And [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2946.88s)]
*  I do hope to unite this sense of energy behind. So what we put together here by engaging these [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2952.16s)]
*  week at JPM, I will be tomorrow at the conference at 2 PM presenting sales. And I do hope to be able [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2960.0s)]
*  to communicate to our energy action around what we're trying to do and bring reassurance that some [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2967.12s)]
*  FizzMerge come from two growth companies, Metro Technology, that's what we need to move us to [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2973.36s)]
*  Fizzeraf fully program our medicine. And I'm quite excited with what it means to patient and [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2979.68s)]
*  shareholder to balance value for shareholders and patients. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2984.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, we'll be, you know, you set the bar. We've talked about how [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2990.2400000000002s)]
*  speed is important and patient benefit. We'll be paying attention to [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=2994.64s)]
*  we'll be trying to hang on for the breakneck ride. So I appreciate you coming and spend some time with [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-lCMrRhOX8&t=3001.92s)]
