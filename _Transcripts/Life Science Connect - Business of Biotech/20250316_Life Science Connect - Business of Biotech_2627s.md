Video Description: Dr. Kasper Roet's hands-on work at the Dutch Brain Bank informed his leadership at the biotech QurAlis, where three clinical programs targeting specific genetic mechanisms in ALS are now underway. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, Life Science Leader's Ben Comer joins to co-host a conversation with Dr. Roet that goes deep on his company's genetic medicine approach to ALS, and even deeper into his opinions on, and growing influence over, the regulatory environment. Roet says that as the FDA's conservative approach to genetic medicines has pushed clinical trials overseas, he's been inspired to form and lead a consortium of 11-and-growing biotechs seeking regulatory reform through organized meetings and lobbying efforts. Join us for this latest of our BoB@JPM series from San Francisco.

**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [March 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU)
*  There's not much metering Dr. Casper Root's confidence in his company's technology can [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=0.0s)]
*  counter neurological disorders like ALS if his long-standing and hands-on commitment [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=10.02s)]
*  to neuro research is any indication that confidence is well placed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm Ben Comer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  And this is the Business of Biotech JP Morgan 2025 edition. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=21.64s)]
*  And we're here in San Francisco at the law offices of Halston and Byrd with Dr. Root, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=26.04s)]
*  founder and CEO of Curalis, to explore the why behind his optimism. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=31.6s)]
*  Dr. Root, thanks for being here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=36.2s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for inviting me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  It's our pleasure, Dr. Root. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  And I noticed you rolled the R on the first pronunciation and then rolled right back into [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=42.44s)]
*  the straight American. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=46.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I tried it and I thought it sounded a little funny coming out of my [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=47.4s)]
*  mouth. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=51.44s)]
*  I need to practice it some more before I pull it back out. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=52.44s)]
*  I give you kudos for even trying. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=53.92s)]
*  Appreciate that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=55.84s)]
*  So, you've got a very diverse and hands-on background in pretty much everything that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=56.84s)]
*  you've done. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=62.72s)]
*  And I'm curious about the beginnings of your career. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=64.4s)]
*  Before you got into life sciences, you started your career in IT. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=67.2s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=70.44s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=71.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=72.44s)]
*  So, tell us a little bit about that and where, when, and why the pivot from IT into life [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=73.44s)]
*  sciences occurred. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=80.72s)]
*  My IT life comes from the fact that I have a passion for computers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=83.48s)]
*  I started that as a very young child. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=89.08s)]
*  And when the internet boom started in the 1990s, I was one of the few people that knew [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=90.92s)]
*  how to assemble computers, take them apart, programs, and build Wi-Fi networks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  And so, when I was finishing my bachelor degree at the University of Amsterdam, me and two [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=101.44s)]
*  friends were asked to help with small companies and student houses to set up their IT infrastructure [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=110.44s)]
*  so that everyone could get access to the internet. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=116.52s)]
*  So, I kind of rolled that into a company. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=118.96s)]
*  And that became actually an IT company that first built infrastructure, then built web [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  applications, and then also placed IT specialists at other companies to solve their problems. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  I never anticipated being an entrepreneur before that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=133.24s)]
*  It was kind of a natural evolution to become an entrepreneur. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  And when I realized how great it was to actually be able to create your own visions into reality, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=139.84s)]
*  I was caught. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  And I knew why I wanted to be an entrepreneur. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  But I also knew I didn't actually want to be an IT entrepreneur. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=150.44s)]
*  It's my passion. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=154.08s)]
*  I've always been on biology. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=155.08s)]
*  And I really wanted to develop medicine so that we could actually have a world, hopefully, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=157.8s)]
*  a future world where we don't suffer from diseases anymore. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=162.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=166.16s)]
*  Well, let me just say that I think you made the right choice because your personality [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=167.2s)]
*  lends itself to medicine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  I covered IT for like 20 years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=173.0s)]
*  And the IT space, the people that I interviewed in the IT space, not nearly as chill as you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=175.8s)]
*  are, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=182.28s)]
*  Like, there's bigger egos in the IT space than there are in the life sciences. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=183.28s)]
*  So, I think you made the right decision based on what I know about you so far. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=187.2s)]
*  What was your first computer? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=192.64s)]
*  My first computer, you know, like I had a Commodore 64. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=194.96s)]
*  I actually had like a tape game computer before that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=198.88s)]
*  I don't think I must explore that with a call anymore. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  But I think that, well, I guess I'm an Atari before the Commodore. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  So, it's like evolved. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  And you took all this part. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=213.0s)]
*  I always tried to make them a little faster and crank up their memory a little bit so [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=214.0s)]
*  I could play better games. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=218.4s)]
*  That was really the big motivator. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=220.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=221.68s)]
*  What was your foray when you decided that you wanted to pursue something in the life [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=222.68s)]
*  sciences medicine related? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  What was your first foray into that field? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=229.08s)]
*  My first foray, you know, when I started actually with artificial intelligence as in my university [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  track, but I come from the fields of a small farm town. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  Actually the first lake that was dried out, the big lake in the Netherlands was where [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  I grew up and I had a microscope and I caught little bugs in the field and I was just taking [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=251.44000000000003s)]
*  them apart to see how they work. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=259.24s)]
*  And that was really a passion and not just taking the bugs apart, but understanding biology [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  and understanding nature. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  And so I was doing this artificial intelligence, but I realized other people are probably better [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  at programming and I realized I should just do what I'm really good at. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=275.92s)]
*  And so I decided to study medical biology again at the University of Amsterdam. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=281.36s)]
*  And I loved it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=287.0s)]
*  The moment I started that, I was just in love with it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=288.0s)]
*  And then after that, I got enrolled in this IT company, but I went back and did a master's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=291.4s)]
*  in neuroscience. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=297.0s)]
*  And there I was working in one of the former gene therapy labs in the Netherlands, the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=298.68s)]
*  lab of Joost Verhagen was really pushing gene therapy technologies forward because I wanted [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=303.8s)]
*  to translate. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=310.12s)]
*  At that moment, I already knew I wanted to make medicine and about gene therapy is actually [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=311.12s)]
*  an ultimate medicine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=316.36s)]
*  And that kind of got me the exposure in the neuroscience space because that is where Joost [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=319.4s)]
*  was working to make gene therapies for spinal cord repair for paralyzed people. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=325.68s)]
*  And so I did my master's internship there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=330.88s)]
*  I did a master's internship in UCSD with Mark Trushinsky, a big gene therapy scientist there. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=333.8s)]
*  And then I came back to do a PhD, but again, I wanted to do something that was really translational. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=342.96s)]
*  So I started a gene therapy PhD project, which was a collaboration between the University [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  of Amsterdam, the Free University, AMT, which was Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics, which [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=355.2s)]
*  later became Unicure. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=361.0s)]
*  And quite a successful gene therapy company. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=362.8s)]
*  At that time, they actually brought the first gene therapy into the Western markets for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=365.56s)]
*  collaboration. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=370.6s)]
*  And so I was there at that time while they were doing that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=372.08s)]
*  And I was also collaborating with Galapagos. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  They were part of the project. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  Basically, it was called the Center Nolten Project, again, to bring gene therapies to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=379.32s)]
*  spinal cord repair. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=384.24s)]
*  And so the institute where I worked, the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, was actually the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=386.24s)]
*  director there started the Dutch Brain Bank. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=393.12s)]
*  And the Dutch Brain Bank is one of, I think, one of the best brain banks in the world, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=396.44s)]
*  because usually within two hours after a donor passes away, the body is brought to the hospital [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=401.24s)]
*  and we're following an autopsy protocol to take out brain and spinal cord and process [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  that in a certain way, depending on the disease. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=415.4s)]
*  And I started to work there and began an autopsy coordinator, which meant that in the middle [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=420.0s)]
*  of the night, I would get a phone call. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=425.36s)]
*  Someone has passed away. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=427.52s)]
*  Can you please organize the autopsy? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=429.12s)]
*  So I would call the families, I would call the undertaker, I would call the neuropathologist, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=432.84s)]
*  the section assistant. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=437.44s)]
*  We would all go to the hospital. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=438.44s)]
*  We would receive the body. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=440.32s)]
*  We would look at it and I could see the impact that all these neurodegenerative diseases [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=442.48s)]
*  have on patients, talking to their family, looking at their bodies, looking at their [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=447.92s)]
*  brains, looking at their spinal cords, taking it apart and sometimes bringing the tissues [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=452.16s)]
*  back to the Institute, where sometimes in the middle of the night, researchers would [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=457.44s)]
*  come to try to find out things that were happening in those diseases. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=461.04s)]
*  And that really caught me into the broader neurodegenerative space. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=465.36s)]
*  And so, yeah, that is what really started to motivate me, just the incredible impact [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  that those diseases have on those patients, both on them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  Obviously, they've passed away at that point, but also on their families. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=478.4s)]
*  And I decided I do and really specialize in development therapies for neurodegenerative [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  diseases. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=490.32s)]
*  How did that really hands-on experience that the Netherlands Brain Bank influenced your [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=491.44s)]
*  career and where you are now? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=499.52s)]
*  Because that strikes me as unique. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=500.96s)]
*  Not everyone in the industry has that degree of handling a brain that works in neuroscience. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=502.48s)]
*  Yeah, I can tell you it's very helpful right now because we're working on an autopsy program [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  for our current trial and I understand how it works, what it means to have tissue, how [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  it's processed. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=519.2s)]
*  I'm the CEO, but it's good to have that type of understanding. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=521.04s)]
*  And actually, my company is now collaborating with the Dutch Brain Bank. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=524.96s)]
*  We just started a program also for Fragile X. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=529.76s)]
*  We wanted to get tissue from Fragile X patients and the tissue that we got from these patients, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=532.96s)]
*  we've been able to study and really confirm a genetic target for Fragile X. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=538.64s)]
*  I mean, that has really helped me to appreciate the tissue. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=545.2s)]
*  One of the other things that I really took away from that is how often patients are [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=549.04s)]
*  misdiagnosed because clinicians misdiagnose patients based on clinical symptoms. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=552.88s)]
*  Once you open up someone's body and you look actually on how the disease looks inside the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=559.76s)]
*  body, very often we saw that the clinical diagnosis was not correct, but a clinical [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=565.6s)]
*  diagnosis often stands. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=571.28s)]
*  And so when you get tissue from a donor, the clinical diagnosis is the diagnosis. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=574.16s)]
*  You have to really read through that to see if the pathological diagnosis is the same [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=579.68s)]
*  because otherwise you're actually drawing the wrong conclusions on the materials that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=585.04s)]
*  you use. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=589.12s)]
*  And that's a very practical point where my experience there has really given me [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=589.92s)]
*  caution on interpretation of data from material from donors. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=595.28s)]
*  And I think it's helping us do better things in Curalis. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=600.4s)]
*  Yeah. So we kind of fast forwarded to Curalis. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=605.12s)]
*  There were a couple of stops between the Dutch Brain Bank and your founding of Curalis. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=609.92s)]
*  Yeah. Again, I knew I wanted to develop medicine. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=614.88s)]
*  And I realized I know how a lot of companies worked. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=618.96s)]
*  I worked as a computer specialist in a computer company as a side job. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=624.96s)]
*  I was a telephone marketer for a while. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=629.84s)]
*  I worked at an investment bank. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=632.8s)]
*  And so I kind of knew a lot of different sectors, worked in a bar, had no idea how you make a drug. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=636.56s)]
*  And it's like, I want to start a company developing therapeutics. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=642.32s)]
*  I really need to understand how to make a drug. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=645.92s)]
*  And so in the Netherlands, one of the big R&D organizations at that moment there was [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=648.4s)]
*  J&J, who had their Janssen vaccines out there, which was formerly Crucell, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=655.12s)]
*  but was acquired by J&J just before that time that I graduated with my PhD. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=660.8s)]
*  And I applied there and got a job first as an assay potency development team leader. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=668.64s)]
*  And that kind of progressed into becoming a technical integrator. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=674.64s)]
*  And there I learned how you get something from research all the way to the clinic, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=678.96s)]
*  because I worked together with, for Malaysia Phil and Finnish, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=685.36s)]
*  upstream processing, downstream processing, clinical assays, QC assays, R&D, CMC. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=688.48s)]
*  And there a couple of years in, I really understood how you can actually make a drug [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=694.96s)]
*  and how the pharmaceutical business works and what type of experts you need. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=700.0s)]
*  And all of that. And while I was doing that, C9-OF72 was discovered, big ALS gene. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=704.4s)]
*  My PhD program was spinal cord repair gene therapies, so neuromuscular. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=711.36s)]
*  ALS is a neuromuscular disease. And so it's the same tissues, but I thought [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=717.28s)]
*  we cannot treat ALS because we don't understand the disease. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  But while I was at J&J, a big ALS gene was discovered. And then rapidly [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=725.84s)]
*  30 other ALS genes were discovered. And I'm a big data person, probably because of my passion [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=730.24s)]
*  for computers. And so I started looking at that and I thought, this is incredible. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=736.96s)]
*  We have the genetics of the disease. I could see pathways emerge. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=742.24s)]
*  We could see disease mechanisms emerge. And so in my hobby time, I took published [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=746.0s)]
*  data sets from post-mortem tissues, again, connected to my work at the Dutch Brain Bank, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=752.16s)]
*  with all the transcriptional profiles and all genome way to identify hot genes that would explain [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=757.76s)]
*  why the disease actually develops and how you could potentially treat it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=764.88s)]
*  I also realized we need a translational model so that we can test therapeutics and test hypotheses. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=771.12s)]
*  And did the same with all of the animal models that were published, all of the transcription [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=778.08s)]
*  data sets from all of the different ALS models that were published. So I built this whole meta [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=782.8s)]
*  analysis of human and animal, what we'll call it post-mortem tissue, to see if I could find things [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=787.44s)]
*  that were conserved between the two model systems. Zero overlap. I was incredibly frustrated because [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=795.12s)]
*  we have the genetics. We know what's gone wrong in patients. We can probably develop therapeutics, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=802.96s)]
*  but we have no way to test it. How do we test this? And then I discovered Kevin Eggensworth, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=808.96s)]
*  who was at Harvard and had taken skin cells from a patient together with his collaborator at [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=814.24s)]
*  Mass General Hospital, James Berry. And he had used the Yamanaka protocols to turn drugs into [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=820.72s)]
*  stem cells. And he's a developmental biologist by training and knew how to make motor neurons from [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  stem cells. And so he was able to create motor neurons from patients. And so the same neurons [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=832.24s)]
*  that are dying in a patient's spinal cord, it would recreate from a skin cell and study. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=838.0s)]
*  And so I thought this is phenomenal. That must translate. If we can see what has gone wrong in [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=844.0s)]
*  a patient's own cells in the cells that are dying in their disease, and we can test potential [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=849.68s)]
*  therapeutics, then it must be translating again back to patients. And so I decided to put my job [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=855.04s)]
*  at J&J. I looked up Kevin, who was collaborating with Clifford Wolfe, another professor, the head [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=861.28s)]
*  of the neurobiology center at Children's Hospital. And I said, can I please work with you? Because I [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=866.72s)]
*  want to learn this technology, stem cell technology, which was super controversial at that time. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=872.4s)]
*  They like my industry background. They had a collaboration with GSK. I had no one in their [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=878.64s)]
*  labs who actually knew how to work with pharma companies. So it kind of like was a good match. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=882.72s)]
*  And then for three years, I worked together with them, learned everything I wanted to know about [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=887.28s)]
*  these neurobiological model systems. And then I decided, I'm done, I'm going to start my company. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=891.6s)]
*  And so I told Kevin, and my plan was to go back to Europe to do that. So I told Kevin, I'm like, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=898.0s)]
*  thank you so much. It's been incredibly great experience. I'm going to start an ALS [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=903.2s)]
*  company. And I had talked to him about that before. And he said, oh, maybe we can do something [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=910.72s)]
*  together. And I never really took him serious. He was a hard professor. But then he said, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=914.48s)]
*  well, let's do that together. And let's do it here. Let me introduce you to some people who [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=922.08s)]
*  might be interested in being part of that. And that actually led to the creation of Curalis. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=927.12s)]
*  And both Kevin and Cliff became co-founders together with myself and the CEO of another [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=932.96s)]
*  company that Kevin started, Jonathan Fleming, who used to be a managing partner at Oxford [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=939.52s)]
*  Biosciences. He decided to be part of that as well. And we created Curalis to develop [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=944.48s)]
*  precision therapeutics for A-less based on the insight derived from these patient-derived [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=950.32s)]
*  disease models. And so the first two big discoveries that were made are now in the clinic. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=955.2800000000001s)]
*  Those are our first clinical programs. I had just a follow up on J&J. Is Curalis [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=960.6400000000001s)]
*  a member of J-Labs, part of the incubator there? Yes. And what sort of benefits come along with [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=968.1600000000001s)]
*  that? What's your experience with that program? I think J&J has J-Labs to get close access to [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=976.0s)]
*  new and exciting technologies. So Curalis started the company where Jonathan worked [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=984.08s)]
*  was called Q-State. And Curalis was founded out of Q-State. So Q-State was helping get Curalis [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=993.52s)]
*  established. The first office that I had was basically a closet in Q-State. It's like a little [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1001.52s)]
*  room in the middle of the building without any windows. I got my wife on the plant. The plant [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1007.68s)]
*  was the real employee in the office. But we were raising a little bit of seed money. And then [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1013.68s)]
*  someone advised me to apply for a golden ticket with Amgen to get access to Lab Central. Lab [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1020.72s)]
*  Central is one of the, maybe the foremost bio incubator space in the world. It's like in the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1028.64s)]
*  middle of Kendall Square, 700 Main Street started by Johannes Brueghauff. And I won. Curalis won the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1034.88s)]
*  Amgen Golden ticket. They had a ticket like this big. Yeah. Like a piece of cardboard. But it gave [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1046.0s)]
*  me access to Lab Central. And I actually didn't know what it was until I got there. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1053.36s)]
*  J-Labs is a sponsor of Lab Central. And so our office that we got at Lab Central was right next [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1058.3999999999999s)]
*  to J-Labs office. And so suddenly we had this and then we became a J-Labs member. We are part and [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1065.04s)]
*  we want that as well. But what you then get is a very close vicinity to a large pharmaceutical [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1072.4799999999998s)]
*  company and the people that are interested in new technologies. And we were bringing [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1078.24s)]
*  precision therapies based on stem cell technology, which is a very new technology at that time. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1083.84s)]
*  So J&J was very interested in that. The other company that was right next to that was Roche. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1088.48s)]
*  They also had an office like right next to us. And so that is one of these amazing things that [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1094.4s)]
*  you have in Kendall Square. It's just close to all of these companies. And we won another golden [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1098.96s)]
*  ticket from Pfizer, another year of extension at Lab Central. But it's really the proximity [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1103.68s)]
*  of small companies to large companies, which makes Cambridge and Massachusetts such an exciting [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1110.8s)]
*  environment. Basically in Lab Central is kind of been a bit of all of that because that's where [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1115.8400000000001s)]
*  it all kind of comes together in a very close entity. Where's the company located now? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1120.4s)]
*  So at some point when we were starting to close our series A, it was time for us to get more space. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1127.1200000000001s)]
*  I wanted to stay in Kendall because I liked the buzz, but my team set Casper to commute to Kendall. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1137.52s)]
*  It's really painful for us. We live outside of the city. It takes us half an hour just to be in [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1144.8000000000002s)]
*  Cambridge and then half an hour back if it's a good day so we can get a little bit further away. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1150.3999999999999s)]
*  So I said fine, we're going to stay in Cambridge. So we are now behind the ill-luck station in West [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  Cambridge. There's a little biotech hub there as well. GSK sits there. UCB sits there. ASI sits [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1161.6s)]
*  there. A bunch of little companies. It's actually quite a nice, a little small. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1169.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1175.04s)]
*  Our friends at Alston and Byrd set us up with some amazing space to record during JPM Week. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1177.92s)]
*  The firm's National Healthcare and Life Sciences practice has more than 100 attorneys actively [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1184.16s)]
*  involved in the healthcare industry across the full spectrum of legal disciplines. The signature [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1189.52s)]
*  strength of this practice is its ability to master complex representations that draw on the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1195.92s)]
*  coordinated expertise of its regulatory, compliance, public policy, transactional, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1201.6s)]
*  corporate governance, securities, FDA, biotech, IP, government investigations, and litigation [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1207.76s)]
*  practice areas. Alston and Byrd represents life sciences companies and their partners in corporate [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1216.3999999999999s)]
*  stages ranging from private to newly public to well-established and in a variety of stages of [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1222.08s)]
*  product development from preclinical to post-approval commercial launch. Learn more [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1228.88s)]
*  at Alston.com and tell them you learned about them on the Business of Biotech. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1234.48s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about the regulatory scene and the space that you're in. You just [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1241.5200000000002s)]
*  mentioned your clinical programs and we'll get into that a little bit more deeply later on in [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1245.2s)]
*  conversation. Being in a space that's not super well charted from a regulatory standpoint, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1252.48s)]
*  what's been your experience with the regulators as you've moved those programs into the clinic? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1259.04s)]
*  Yeah, our experience with the regulators overall has been good, but we've noticed that the FDA [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1265.44s)]
*  has a kind of on the genetic medicines where our programs cannot fall, specifically the RNA [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1274.08s)]
*  therapeutic study. FDA has a very conservative approach to that, very much focused on risk, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1282.24s)]
*  much less focused on benefit. That has basically driven us to start our clinical work outside of [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1290.8s)]
*  the United States. So, Puralis is running programs. We have now three programs and they're running in [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1298.48s)]
*  six different countries in Canada, the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1304.96s)]
*  and not in the US. Then we found out that a lot of other companies are doing the exact same thing. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1312.96s)]
*  When I started to talk around, are we the only people that think that we shouldn't start in the [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1321.92s)]
*  US? We actually found out that almost every company that we talked to has that opinion [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1327.8400000000001s)]
*  because it creates just a regulatory risk and a hurdle. Why would you take that, basically, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1333.76s)]
*  if you don't have to? So, we've brought together consortium of companies. It's now 11 companies [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1342.32s)]
*  with we as kind of the founding members, Curalis, Stokes Therapeutics, Avility Bio, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1351.44s)]
*  Ultragenics, and we brought together other companies and then to really try to catalyze [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1358.8s)]
*  changes and work with the FDA to see if we can build more of a risk benefit approach [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1367.2s)]
*  into the regulatory pathway. So, I think the FDA in particular has done a lot of really good things [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1374.8s)]
*  on the back end, trying to get to circuit endpoints, biomarkers, and all time. There's [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1381.52s)]
*  been a remarkable step forward there with Amaloid in ALS where we are currently with our programs, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1387.52s)]
*  big step forward because of neurofilament for the SOD1 population. So, I think there's been a big [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1396.32s)]
*  big development and evolution in a positive way on getting drugs maybe faster through the development [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1402.8s)]
*  pipeline and maybe faster to an accelerated approval, but on the front end there's been a very [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1412.72s)]
*  rigid system and so we think that there should be improvements there. So, we've made that [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1420.3999999999999s)]
*  from a consortium. We've made a case to the FDA, went to the rare disease hub day which was [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1427.3600000000001s)]
*  organized in October. I presented there, Stoke presented there, Avility presented there. There [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1434.08s)]
*  were a number of other companies that were presenting there as well and we made it clear [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1439.28s)]
*  we'd like to work with the FDA because they made this important step on creating a rare disease hub [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1444.08s)]
*  to see if there could be ways in which we can also smooth this process. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1451.28s)]
*  At this moment, American innovation is basically leaving the United States [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1455.76s)]
*  and it's not benefiting American patients and that has got a broken system. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1460.56s)]
*  Is it your feeling that the regulators have been open to listening and collaborating with you? Do [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1465.6000000000001s)]
*  you feel like you've been able to move the needle as a company? Yes, I think there are differences [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  also in the way CBER and CDER operate, but Peter Marx was there, Patricia Caprizzone was there, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1477.6000000000001s)]
*  and I was able to connect with both of them and you don't get commitments that [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  they're right there on the spot, but there was definitely a positive attitude and understanding [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1493.1200000000001s)]
*  that there were... This wasn't the first time that they heard about it and like other companies have, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1498.96s)]
*  but this is the first time that I think the companies are kind of united and I know the [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1505.3600000000001s)]
*  large pharmaceutical companies have the exact same few points because I talked to all of them [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1509.76s)]
*  because we're all working together. But there's definitely an understanding and there was an [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1515.12s)]
*  appreciation and a willingness I think to make improvements. And so the FDA has then put out a [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1520.8799999999999s)]
*  call to get written feedback and then recently also put out a call for all of the nucleotide [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1528.32s)]
*  therapies on what could be an improvement for the regulatory framework. And again, on behalf of the [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1534.3999999999999s)]
*  consortium, we have provided that and that was just submitted like two days ago. And so it all [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1540.48s)]
*  takes time. I think there is definitely... There are things moving in hopefully a positive direction, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1546.88s)]
*  but obviously Rob Kaler stepped down to kind of get a new commissioner, Patricia Caprizzone, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1554.0s)]
*  he just announced to step down. So we also have to see what's going to be there to work with. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1561.1200000000001s)]
*  Hopefully that will not create too much chaos if we continue to move. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1567.2s)]
*  I was going to ask where you feel... I mean, it sounds like there's a concerted effort that [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1573.44s)]
*  I guess to continue to apply not pressure, but influence. And I was going to ask where perhaps [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1577.8400000000001s)]
*  you feel as though influence is limited or metered, like where more work needs to be done, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1584.88s)]
*  but it sounds like that's kind of TBD depending on some administrative positioning. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1590.0s)]
*  I think so. Yeah. I mean, I knew Rob was going to leave, but the case has [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1594.8s)]
*  departed, I think was a surprise to everyone. And so now we're going to see what we should work with. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1603.12s)]
*  But I think the reason why it's so important is that this is the time of genetic medicine. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1610.8s)]
*  This is the time of RNA therapeutics. You can see a lot of different companies active in this space. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1618.08s)]
*  The genetic insights into disease, the thing that got me interested to develop therapies for ALS, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1624.0s)]
*  because the genetics gives us a real handle on how to treat this disease. The best way to do that [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1629.8400000000001s)]
*  is probably through genetic medicine, because the two kind of like link very nicely together. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1635.92s)]
*  But you have to have a different approach to that than you have for small molecules or antibodies. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1641.76s)]
*  And so there's a real need, I think, for us to all evolve rapidly with these new technologies, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1647.12s)]
*  and also from a regulatory side. And so we will continue to communicate that very strongly [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1655.12s)]
*  to the FDA and whoever will be the new leader, subceder and the FDA themselves, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1661.12s)]
*  because there's no time to lose basically. Yeah. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1668.48s)]
*  You're an admitted optimist. How realistic do you think interagency collaboration is in [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1671.84s)]
*  greater harmonization? Well, I think, you know, harmonization can be good, but harmonization can [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1678.8799999999999s)]
*  also be bad. It depends on, you know, which, who's harmonizing. What part harmony are we discussing [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1686.0s)]
*  here? But, you know, there are a lot of things I don't completely understand. I know that the EMA [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1694.6399999999999s)]
*  and the FDA are connecting, Health Canada, the NHRA, but there's a lot of also like higher level [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1701.76s)]
*  conversations. The experiences that we've had with QRLs is that regulators of different countries have [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1709.44s)]
*  a different way of looking at things. And so I think that's fine. And, you know, maybe it's good. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1716.48s)]
*  I'm a big believer in group thinking and the diversity of opinions. It's also good if they [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1722.64s)]
*  communicate a lot so that they can learn from each other. But I'm mostly an optimist because [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1729.76s)]
*  I believe that everyone wants the same thing. Like everyone has family members who have been sick [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1736.48s)]
*  or who have passed away, or you're afraid of family members or friends getting sick or passing [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1742.64s)]
*  away. We all want medicine. We all want to have treatments for diseases. I've met so many people [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1748.72s)]
*  now that have ALS or have passed away from ALS or have family members or friends that have the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1755.44s)]
*  disease. And that's just one disease, right? It's the same in oncology, but the same in epilepsy, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1763.3600000000001s)]
*  you name it. Everyone wants treatments. And so if you use that, then we should all be able to find [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1768.56s)]
*  common grounds to do the right things and to make a framework that supports therapy development. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1776.0s)]
*  So I'm very optimistic because I think it's common sense. I don't know why anyone wouldn't [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1781.4399999999998s)]
*  want to do that. Well, and I think ALS has one of the more active patient advocacy communities. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1786.08s)]
*  Wasn't the original ice bucket challenge around ALS supported? Does that help you, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1793.12s)]
*  you know, in your role at Curalis? Yes, the ice bucket challenge was really created by Pete Crates [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1800.08s)]
*  and the ALS Association has really lifted that, I think, to a global awareness. It has been [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1807.36s)]
*  incredibly important for ALS because I think most people have not even heard of the disease before [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1814.8s)]
*  the ice bucket challenge. Now everyone knows about the disease. It has also brought a lot of money [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1820.24s)]
*  to the foundation and to other organizations. And one of my fellowships when I was working at Harvard [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1826.8s)]
*  was from the ALS Association. So, you know, in a way, the research that has also led to the [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1834.08s)]
*  creation of Curalis is, I think, directly supported by money from the ice bucket challenge. Milton [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1840.3999999999999s)]
*  saved no great scholarship. So yes, I think that type of awareness and that action has been [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1847.28s)]
*  incredibly important. You referenced this, you know, I guess the risk of the exodus of [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1858.64s)]
*  clinical activity and innovation away from the FDA, you know, because there are lower barriers [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1867.3600000000001s)]
*  and other perhaps lower barriers and other regulatory jurisdictions. That's to say, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1876.0s)]
*  you didn't even mention Australia, which has been, you know, one of the major sort of siphons of [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1880.24s)]
*  clinical activity away from the U.S. What would you call on the space to do? Like you've been [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1885.44s)]
*  like admirably active in calling for and influencing change. What would you call on the rest of the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1892.88s)]
*  space to do? Like what levers might they have to push and pull to sort of join the effort? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1899.92s)]
*  And do you see enough activity going on in the greater landscape? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1906.4s)]
*  Well, once you start doing these things, you notice how many other companies are doing that. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1910.72s)]
*  I think the weakness, I think, is that companies advocate for themselves a lot and don't unite [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1915.92s)]
*  enough to have a united message. Because if one company goes and is lobbying for, you know, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1924.4s)]
*  to work for the, in this case, the FDA to look at its own processes, it feels like that company is [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1933.68s)]
*  just trying to help themselves. Right. And no one likes that because that just feels kind of like [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1939.28s)]
*  it doesn't feel good. It's like you're trying to skew the system in your own benefit, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1945.68s)]
*  but that's not what we're trying to do. There's definitely something not working in the system. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1950.64s)]
*  And the things in that will benefit everyone. And so we've done a lot of background conversations [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1956.64s)]
*  also with companies that maybe don't want to publicly be part of a consortium, but that we [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1963.76s)]
*  have the same message. The same message is being heard over and over and over again. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1969.68s)]
*  Because in the end, if you give 10 different messages to someone, they can't remember any of [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1975.6000000000001s)]
*  it. Right. I mean, someone remembers maybe three things very well. So you want to make sure that [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1981.92s)]
*  you have your priorities straight as a whole biotech sector and that you give the same message [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1988.56s)]
*  that even if it is not part of our consortium, but an independent message. And so that is something [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=1994.4s)]
*  that we've been doing also with the consortium. And now talk to all of the large companies that [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2000.3200000000002s)]
*  are active in the ALS space and they're all, we're all aligned. So it's important that we [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2005.28s)]
*  work in that manner basically. Yeah. Maybe we can turn it back to Kira Alice's development [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2011.92s)]
*  in clinical assets right now. Could you give us a sense of where you are and maybe what your [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2018.8799999999999s)]
*  next big milestones or goals are with your clinical programs? Yes. I'd be very happy to. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2025.68s)]
*  Ben. So, and just maybe want to also explain where the clinical programs come from. So the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2032.24s)]
*  first big discovery that was made using patients stem cells derived from, well, the patient stem [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2041.2s)]
*  cells, which were then generated into neurons was that there's a loss of a potassium channel called [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2047.84s)]
*  KB7.2. The loss of that potassium channel leads to a neuronal death in these stem cell models. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2054.48s)]
*  And so if you activate that potassium channel, you can protect against that. We found out it's [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2061.84s)]
*  misplaced. It's pre-mRNA includes a skeptic axon, which turns it into a protein, which is rapidly [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2068.0s)]
*  degraded, again, leading to neuronal death, but you can protect against that with a KB7 opener. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2075.6000000000004s)]
*  So that is something that we have now brought to the clinic. And that program is currently at the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2082.08s)]
*  end of its phase one. We've actually run three studies, four steps in parallel, a math study, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2087.76s)]
*  a multiple ascending dose study to look at tolerability, of course, incredibly important. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2096.96s)]
*  We've also run a healthy volunteer study to look at biomarkers that predict survival for ALS, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2102.6400000000003s)]
*  but also for epilepsy to look at biomarkers that predict efficacy in epilepsy, because [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2109.1200000000003s)]
*  the potassium channels are also very important for epilepsy. We ran a key case study to look at [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2114.16s)]
*  three different formulations to see which formulations would be best for these different [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2119.84s)]
*  indications. And we've also ran a patient study to see how this compact works in patients. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2124.24s)]
*  Most of that data is reading out at the end of this quarter. And so this is an incredibly important [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2131.2799999999997s)]
*  quarter for us. And so we're very excited about looking at the results. Then we have the second [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2137.36s)]
*  discovery that was made. Again, for my co-founder was the loss of staph-min2, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2143.6800000000003s)]
*  microtubule stabilizer protein, essential for the innervation of your muscle. So your motor neurons [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2150.1600000000003s)]
*  protect from your spinal cord all the way to your muscles, for instance, in your hands and in your [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2156.32s)]
*  feet. That innervation is lost when there's a loss of staph-min2. What Kevin discovered is that it's [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2160.4s)]
*  driven by a mis-splicing event. And when we realized that, it was just after spin-ros, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2166.88s)]
*  it was the proof for spinal muscular atrophy, splice correction ASO, targeting motor neurons [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2172.16s)]
*  in the spinal cord of estimated patients, showing remarkable effects in those patients. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2177.68s)]
*  It's really a transforming therapy that is marketed by Biogeek Health and so many different [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2182.24s)]
*  patients. We thought we can do that also for restoring staph-min2 levels and bringing staph-min2 [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2187.3599999999997s)]
*  levels back to normal, which again is lost in almost every ALS patient. At this moment, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2194.16s)]
*  running a dosing-spinning trial in six different countries where patients are those B-30 groups [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2200.48s)]
*  that have injections into their spinal cord with an ASO, an Intestine Oligonucleotide, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2206.56s)]
*  that restores these staph-min2 levels. And we are now basically expanding on two different dose [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2211.6s)]
*  levels to see which of these dose levels is going to be effective for following patients for an [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2217.28s)]
*  extended period of time. We're looking at biomarkers that predict efficacy, neurofilaments, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2223.76s)]
*  and compact muscle action potential, which measures this innovation. And we're going to [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2230.2400000000002s)]
*  read that out in the first half of next year. And what phase are you in on your clinical trials [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2234.32s)]
*  with that student? So I would say that is now in a phase two phase, but with these programs, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2239.84s)]
*  you kind of like adapt from phase one to phase two. With the KV7, we're at the end of phase one, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2247.68s)]
*  and we're planning to start phase two trials at the end of the year. With the KV7 opener, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2253.7599999999998s)]
*  which prevents the potassium channel from shutting down, which then prevents the neuronal [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2259.92s)]
*  death, does that have to be administered very early on after diagnosis of ALS? Or when do you [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2265.8399999999997s)]
*  have to catch the patient to prevent that from closing? Yeah, it's a great question. So ALS is [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2272.8s)]
*  a progressive neurodegenerative disease. And so other than, for instance, in the part of the sense [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2278.7200000000003s)]
*  where if you have symptoms, you've lost almost all of your dopamine-nergic neurons. So there's not a [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2285.76s)]
*  lot to actually protect it. Still, in ALS, when people have developed symptoms, they still have [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2290.88s)]
*  a lot of their motor neurons. And so over time, there's motor neurons that are still healthy. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2296.96s)]
*  There's motor neurons that are sick, and there's motor neurons that have died. And so obviously, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2302.16s)]
*  at the end of the disease, a lot of neurons have died, but at the beginning not. So in essence, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2306.96s)]
*  you can treat anywhere and have an impact on the disease. But in reality, the earlier you treat, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2312.8799999999997s)]
*  the bigger impact you will have on preventing loss of function. So the earlier you treat, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2319.2799999999997s)]
*  the better you are at picking up the effects of a potential therapeutic. And so early treatment [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2324.8799999999997s)]
*  I think has become kind of a norm for all neurodegenerative diseases, not because the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2331.04s)]
*  therapies don't work if you treat later, but just because that's where you have the biggest impact [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2336.2400000000002s)]
*  on the disease. We're going to run short on time here, so just a few more questions. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2340.96s)]
*  No, no, no, you're doing great. Terrific responses. It's been a super meaningful [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2347.92s)]
*  conversation. I like the global aspect of it. But in keeping with progress at Curalis, you mentioned [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2351.92s)]
*  you were one of the fortunate companies to have a presentation at JPMorgan. There are so many [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2359.2799999999997s)]
*  biotechs here who don't have opportunities to present at the conference. They're here for the [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2363.68s)]
*  ancillary activity. How did that go? I mean, it was a great honor to be invited as a private company [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2369.04s)]
*  to present at the JPMorgan conference. So I thought it was a great success. And yeah, I think that- [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2376.8799999999997s)]
*  I didn't anticipate that you would tell me, oh, it was awful, Matt. I mean, it just spiraled. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2384.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well, we got some good questions back also, because there have been failures in the [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2390.16s)]
*  AI last days. And how do we look at that? And yeah, I don't want to go too deep into it, but [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2394.88s)]
*  the traditional approach of companies has just been looking at mechanisms that may play a role [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2400.64s)]
*  in disease and then having a compound or usually a small molecule that acts on that mechanism. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2405.68s)]
*  And I'm hoping that it does something. We're following it really from a genetic approach. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2411.92s)]
*  So we actually have- we're the leading company in the development of therapeutics for ALS, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2416.96s)]
*  because we have three programs in development on genetic targets. The last one, ANC13, is part [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2421.84s)]
*  hand with ELI, which is still preclinical. But it's this genetic approach that we know works. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2428.0s)]
*  And so I've been trying to educate that to people. And so this was a question that we got also to [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2434.0s)]
*  JP Morgan. Just want to give you a little bit more information on that at the bottom. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2441.04s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I was going to ask you, and hopefully this will answer the question, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2447.2799999999997s)]
*  because we spoke like a week or so ago, two weeks ago, we had the opportunity to chit chat with you [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2450.08s)]
*  about what we're going to talk about today. And I remember you saying specifically, like, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2455.04s)]
*  we know it works. We have the tools. And you said, now we just need to do it. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2458.32s)]
*  So hopefully that question is going to be answered. What's going on right now in terms of, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2464.64s)]
*  all right, we're going to go from, we know it works. Now we just need to do it. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2470.16s)]
*  Yeah. So the first gene that was discovered for ALS is SOD1. And that was discovered in 1993. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2473.68s)]
*  It was approved in 2020. So it took 30 years to get to an approval. At this moment, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2482.3999999999996s)]
*  if we understand what is going wrong in the genetics of a disease, we can be in the clinic [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2491.3599999999997s)]
*  four years later with a genetic medicine. The path from a genetic discovery to a development [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2497.44s)]
*  candidate, to an IND, to a POC is a scalable path with these genetic medicines, specifically for [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2503.68s)]
*  RNA therapeutics. And so that is very powerful because genetics makes us understand why someone [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2510.64s)]
*  gets sick, not for every disease, but for a lot of diseases, we understand the genetics. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2518.16s)]
*  We have now the technology to build that into a medicine relatively quickly in a very [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2523.12s)]
*  reproducible manner. And so we have now done at Curalis, we've made four development candidates. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2530.2400000000002s)]
*  We know exactly how long that takes. We know exactly how to do these END enabling studies. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2536.16s)]
*  And we now have also learned how to actually run POC programs. That's not just for ALS, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2542.8s)]
*  but there's many other diseases where that can be done. And again, that comes back again on why we [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2549.6s)]
*  need also a regulatory framework that fits with that. Because I think as a humanity, you heard me [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2555.28s)]
*  say this in the beginning, no one wants to be sick. No one wants their friends and family members to [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2561.68s)]
*  be sick. We have an opportunity to make really meaningful therapeutics for many different people [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2567.2s)]
*  in a very fast way, relatively to the past, and in a very high probability of success. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2573.44s)]
*  But so we need to do it. Yeah. That's Curalis founder and CEO Casper Root. I'm Ben Gommert. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2583.84s)]
*  Very nice. And I'm Matt Feller. Much better job. Oh, thank you. And you just listened to the [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGCnnP_quU&t=2594.08s)]
