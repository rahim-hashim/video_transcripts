# BoB@JPM: Tom Chalberg, Ph.D., Genascence
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY)
*  Genesense is looking to read a renaissance in gene therapy, taking it from high dollar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=0.0s)]
*  antidote in rare disease to an accessible approach to treating common conditions like [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=9.6s)]
*  osteoarthritis. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=14.42s)]
*  Dr. Tom Chalberg is leading the charge. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=15.42s)]
*  I'm Ben Comer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And this is the Business of Biotech, JPMorgan 2025 edition. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  And we're here in San Francisco with Dr. Chalberg to learn about his role in driving gene therapy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=25.96s)]
*  from the stuff of academic research centers to a doctor's office near you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=31.16s)]
*  Dr. Chalberg, it's super nice to have you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=36.36s)]
*  I appreciate the time you're taking out of your very busy week here in San Francisco [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=39.24s)]
*  to spend with us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=42.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=43.88s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here and looking forward to the show. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=44.88s)]
*  The pleasure's all ours. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=47.6s)]
*  So as we do, we start with some background on you, on our guest. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=48.6s)]
*  And you earned your PhD in cancer biology, genetics, and ophthalmology, and went pretty [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=54.0s)]
*  directly, it appears, into pharma marketing and commercial operations at Genentech. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=59.96s)]
*  So I'm curious, when you were coming out of academia with those degrees, was pharma immediately [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=68.64s)]
*  on your radar, or was it an opportunistic move on a agenda working in pharma? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, it's a great question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=79.64s)]
*  So coming back, you know, I was a graduate student really in the early 2000s, and when [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=82.12s)]
*  you think back to that period, it was really right around the time the human genome had [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=89.04s)]
*  been sequenced. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=91.92s)]
*  And I thought, you know, what an amazing opportunity to be able to go back to school and learn [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=93.72s)]
*  about genetics and basic science. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=97.92s)]
*  But I was really always interested in genetic medicines and the idea that we could use this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=101.48s)]
*  new knowledge in genetics and in molecular biology to treat human diseases. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=107.16s)]
*  And so at the time, I joined a lab that was really, you know, more than basic science. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=112.82s)]
*  It was interested in the applications of, you know, gene therapy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  And in this case, it was really a kind of an early form of gene editing in order to, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=122.12s)]
*  you know, help, you know, sort of technology assessment and technology development in preclin whole [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=127.6s)]
*  models of disease. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=133.72s)]
*  And so I was really always interested in, you know, even when I was in grad school, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=134.72s)]
*  in how do we use this technology to bring forward improvements to human health. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=139.68s)]
*  And, you know, I was actually a Howard Hughes fellow, and that was part of his vision is [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=145.04s)]
*  of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute was how do we always think about furthering human [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=148.76s)]
*  health. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=152.44s)]
*  And so when I was looking for a job, you know, Genentech was, you know, absolutely one of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=153.44s)]
*  the greatest places to work, and it was growing massively at the time. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=158.32s)]
*  It was back in 2005. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=161.56s)]
*  And I started in commercial operations and then marketing because I really wanted to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=165.0s)]
*  learn about the business of biotech and sort of how does that end of the spectrum, you [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=169.08s)]
*  know, exist in sort of really being the endpoint for what we all do now is develop stage biotechs [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  is to kind of bring forward medicines to make them available to patients who have, you know, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=181.4s)]
*  big on the needs and help them live their lives. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  Was that interest in the business side of biotech? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=192.04s)]
*  Was there a little seed in the back of your head from day one that said, I'm going to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  be a biotech builder one day? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=198.32s)]
*  Like that was the means to what end? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=200.56s)]
*  You know, I mean, perhaps not. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=203.72s)]
*  I mean, perhaps there was always, you know, something, you know, germinating, but certainly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  not that I was aware of. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=209.48s)]
*  I was, you know, despite being in Silicon Valley, you know, in the early 2000s and I [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=210.48s)]
*  think, you know, maybe now I would say entrepreneurial by nature, but I certainly didn't know that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=216.56s)]
*  at the time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=223.56s)]
*  I was, you know, definitely enjoying, you know, big company life. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=224.56s)]
*  And it was really, you know, just an opportunity that came by that said something that I had [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  worked on and been close to at grad school, you know, started to form the ideas of a company. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=233.36s)]
*  And so together with, you know, some great mentors and co-founders, we decided to kind [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  of have a go at it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=241.8s)]
*  And, you know, if you think back, that was actually 2008. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=243.64s)]
*  And if you remember 2008, it was a very difficult time to raise money. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  This was avalanche? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=250.72s)]
*  This was for avalanche. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  So it was 2008, 2009, 2010. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  I was still at Genentech, but we were starting to, you know, form the ideas that then became [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  avalanche and then finally I left in 2010 to do that full time. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  But yes, 2008, not a good time to launch anything. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=268.56s)]
*  I mean, in a sense, it was a great time to start. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=269.56s)]
*  And in a sense, it was a bad time to start. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=272.68s)]
*  It was a bad time to start because no one was, you know, deploying capital at all during [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=274.64s)]
*  the global financial crisis of 2008, 2010. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=277.8s)]
*  No companies were getting funding, let alone early stage biotech, let alone gene therapy [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=280.72s)]
*  for kind of any indications. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=286.88s)]
*  But at the same time, I think, you know, during these down cycles are really times when you [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=288.92s)]
*  can think about innovation, you know, in a more quiet way. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=295.52s)]
*  You don't have, you know, very well funded competitors that are, you know, trying to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=301.16s)]
*  outpace you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=305.48s)]
*  And as an entrepreneur, I think often we have to think about, you know, where is the puck [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=306.48s)]
*  going? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=311.92s)]
*  How do you, you know, not imagine what everybody knows is going to be great today because it's [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=312.92s)]
*  very hard to out-compete, you know, companies that are more well resourced. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=317.2s)]
*  But you know, what is going to be possible in three, four or five years and how can we [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=322.4s)]
*  start working on that now so that once, you know, the rest of the, you know, investor [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=328.32s)]
*  community and world takes notice, you know, we've made some progress and have, you know, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=332.28s)]
*  some kind of, you know, already head start and advantage basically over a well funded [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=336.76s)]
*  competitor. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=344.36s)]
*  That's a difficult thing to do. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=345.36s)]
*  I mean, what kind of tea leaves do you look at to anticipate, you know, where you want [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=346.36s)]
*  to be in four or five years? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=351.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=353.52s)]
*  I mean, it's a, I think it's a really interesting question and one that entrepreneurs, you know, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=355.2s)]
*  really spend a lot of time thinking about. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=358.84s)]
*  And you know, when you think about the kind of the investment cycles, there are things [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=360.24s)]
*  that are hot and there are things that are not, right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  Rare disease will come in and out of fashion or, you know, CNS or, you know, now immunology [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=367.64s)]
*  is a buzzword. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=371.64s)]
*  I and I immunology and inflammation is something that people spend a lot of time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=372.64s)]
*  Cartes were hot for a while. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=376.32s)]
*  You know, ecology, everybody remembers that wave. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=378.0s)]
*  And, you know, despite these sort of waves of enthusiasm in the investment community, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=381.48s)]
*  the progress on these technologies is pretty much steady and linear over time because academics [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=388.36s)]
*  get grants and they create new discoveries and they publish papers and you can sort of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=395.48s)]
*  see this progression in the field. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  And so if you're paying close attention to, you know, kind of what's happening at the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=402.48s)]
*  fundamental, you know, science level, then perhaps you're interested in something before [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=407.4s)]
*  the field is. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think that's where entrepreneurs, you know, spend a lot of time and kind of think [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=414.2s)]
*  about, OK, this has come a long way, but nobody's noticed it yet. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  What's the overlooked area that we can capitalize on with this? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  And sometimes I think you're right and sometimes, of course, you're wrong. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=428.08s)]
*  But, you know, in the end, that's that's part of where entrepreneurs can fit in the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=430.56s)]
*  ecosystem is sort of in this area, sort of before the big, you know, well-funded competitors [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=435.68s)]
*  take notice. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=441.48s)]
*  It's interesting that in order to have sight of that, it occurs to me that being in the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=442.48s)]
*  academic community is advantageous, but not all folks in the academic community have the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=448.92s)]
*  entrepreneurship angle or bug or desire. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=454.32s)]
*  Right. So it's a sort of a sort of a catch there. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=458.08s)]
*  I think that's right. I mean, you know, academics are terrific at innovating. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=461.88s)]
*  They're extremely creative and they have a lot of time to sort of think and trial new [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=465.36s)]
*  things as part of the, you know, of having a set up already in an academic lab and have [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=469.16s)]
*  some grants and having some, you know, skilled labor, you know, sitting around looking for [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=475.52s)]
*  new projects. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=481.56s)]
*  And, you know, some academics are terrific entrepreneurs and start many, many companies [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  and they start all of their own projects. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=486.4s)]
*  And some would rather stay in academic labs and sort of let the technology licensing [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=487.64s)]
*  offices, you know, prosecute the opportunity. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=493.92s)]
*  So I think you see, you know, a huge variation across the board. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=496.0s)]
*  But, you know, as as someone who, you know, developed this interest in entrepreneurship, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  you know, there's certainly opportunities if you look for them where exactly as you say, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  there's, you know, projects and discoveries that are waiting for, you know, because [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=510.12s)]
*  universities don't sell things, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=514.6s)]
*  They don't manufacture and sell drugs. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=517.84s)]
*  And so there's, of course, always a handoff to industry at some point in the process. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=519.76s)]
*  Was it something that you had to nurture in yourself, the entrepreneurial piece, or did [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=524.16s)]
*  it come naturally like you recognize as something you wanted to do and just look for opportunities? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=529.8s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=535.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, I am a relieving genetic in 2010 and starting at Lanch. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=535.88s)]
*  And I was the first full time employee and sort of thinking about, oh, my gosh, you know, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=542.92s)]
*  what's going to happen next week? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=549.24s)]
*  How am I going to know what's going to happen in quarter two? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=550.52s)]
*  What's going to where are we going to be a year from now? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=553.08s)]
*  And sort of being filled with this uncertainty around the future. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=555.48s)]
*  Right. And sort of, oh, my gosh, where's our next funding going to come from? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=560.9200000000001s)]
*  We don't know what the data are going to say. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=564.76s)]
*  And having grown up and spending your time in school where you really have quite a lot [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  of control over your whatever next grades, your project in grad school, your project [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=572.2s)]
*  at work, where you kind of have a pretty clear idea of the progression of your career and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=579.88s)]
*  so on. I can certainly see that, how I say that Genentech. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=585.56s)]
*  That it's so different being being an entrepreneur and sort of the stress of that is actually [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=590.12s)]
*  quite real and quite significant. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  But then sort of realizing that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=599.52s)]
*  You know, when you take step back and take a moment of like, this is why we're here, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=603.4s)]
*  this is why entrepreneurs are doing what they're doing, because it's risky, because it's [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=608.76s)]
*  uncertain and sort of letting that watch over you and drowning in the uncertainty of the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=612.72s)]
*  position and going from there to, OK, we don't know what tomorrow is going to look like. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=619.72s)]
*  We're just going to make good decisions along the way and follow the data and listen to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=624.52s)]
*  advice and try to build something that's valuable. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=631.0s)]
*  And then, you know, hopefully good things happen. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=633.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=635.76s)]
*  The time between Avalanche and Genesense. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=637.24s)]
*  I don't want to belabor it too much, but let's take a sort of a brisk walk from Avalanche to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=639.84s)]
*  the founding of Genesense. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=645.96s)]
*  Sure. So I left Avalanche in 2015 and it was following some disappointing clinical data and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=647.52s)]
*  it was a difficult time for the company because we were going to have to restructure. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=652.96s)]
*  And I decided to, you know, set down, bring in a new CEO. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=655.92s)]
*  And I took a job with a brand new startup called Enchorus that Mitch Feiner and NPM and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=660.24s)]
*  Deerfield were starting and it was based in Boston. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=667.92s)]
*  So I spent most of my time in Boston for about a year, year and a half to get that off off its [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=670.32s)]
*  feet. And that was a great experience. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=676.88s)]
*  It was awesome to work in a different biotech market. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=678.16s)]
*  You know, we'd been in the Bay Area to get to know the Boston ecosystem a little bit and to work [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=680.8s)]
*  with some terrific investors and a great board and some really terrific operators as well. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  So that was always designed as a temporary race because I wanted to move back to California. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=691.64s)]
*  And so in 2016 came back and since then really have been doing formation and seed investing. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=695.0799999999999s)]
*  And this means starting companies, putting capital in the first couple million dollars and [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=703.0799999999999s)]
*  really with the idea of can we de-risk some of the key elements so that we can get to a place where [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=710.92s)]
*  it's really fundable at a bigger level. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=718.36s)]
*  And so that really involved tech transfer from universities, designing some experiments that we [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=720.04s)]
*  thought could add a lot of value and then building the rest of the stories. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=725.6s)]
*  We could go out and pitch it to later stage investors who are ready to fund later stage work. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=730.2s)]
*  And so the first project that we did was Cyclist Vision. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=737.08s)]
*  And this was founded right about that time, 2016. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=741.7600000000001s)]
*  And it was the great pleasure of working with Jay and Maureen Knight from the University of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=745.8000000000001s)]
*  Washington who had this terrific technology for myopia. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=751.08s)]
*  And basically they had developed this hypothesis about how myopia works. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=756.24s)]
*  And they had even done a very early clinical tests with kids wearing special glasses that could slow [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=761.8000000000001s)]
*  down the progression of myopia. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=767.0s)]
*  And I thought this is pretty interesting. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=768.48s)]
*  Now myopia people really don't appreciate I think in the United States. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=770.52s)]
*  It doesn't have quite the visibility, you know, and it's for the market. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=774.28s)]
*  No pun intended on. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=779.0s)]
*  Exactly. We're a little myopic here about myopia. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=780.76s)]
*  But when you get into the field a little bit, you realize that this is an enormous problem in East [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=784.6s)]
*  Asia and Singapore and China and Taiwan and Japan where almost everyone has [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=789.2s)]
*  nearsightedness and one in five people by the time they turn age 18 have severe nearsightedness [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=794.72s)]
*  that can lead to ocular complications and other kinds of problems later in life. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=800.6400000000001s)]
*  And so Cyclist Vision was a terrific project. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=805.44s)]
*  You know, my co-founder Michael Furtick came from the tech world and we started this company [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=809.08s)]
*  together. We licensed the technology from University of Washington and built a company, ran a [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=812.6800000000001s)]
*  feast through trial, which was really successful and ended up selling the company to [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=817.16s)]
*  Cooper Vision, then spun it back out into a joint venture with Eslore Luxottica. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=822.92s)]
*  Product's been very successful and is selling very well in China and helping ultimately [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=829.9599999999999s)]
*  helping kids see better, which is so gratifying. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=835.4s)]
*  So really credit to Jay Knights and Marie Knights and their team University of Washington [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=838.28s)]
*  for sort of having the vision to create that product. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=842.8s)]
*  You know, after Cyclist, we've done a couple of more companies that are really in this [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=848.16s)]
*  formation, you know, spirit of putting the first capital, transferring technology to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=852.68s)]
*  from the university to the company, building the company and trying to get it through the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=862.6s)]
*  initial stages. One has been Genesense and we'll talk about that. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=866.12s)]
*  The other is, as you mentioned in the introduction, a separate project for Glaucoma coming out [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=869.48s)]
*  of Trinity College of Dublin. And so both of those have been, you know, major focuses [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=876.36s)]
*  for me for the last several years. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=880.84s)]
*  This, the greater mission to apply gene therapy solutions to broad indications that are [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=885.48s)]
*  outside the realm of where gene therapies have lived for so long in like ultra rare and rare [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=895.8s)]
*  diseases. Is that part of the, I don't know, is that part of the thing that energizes you? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=901.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's really been a long term interest and an idea and hypothesis and hope that we could [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=908.44s)]
*  bring genetic medicines and gene therapy to major public health problems. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=917.16s)]
*  Right. So you think about gene therapy, well, it's like right in the name, gene therapy, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=922.28s)]
*  genetic disease. And so a lot of people were sort of having this one to one correlation [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=926.9200000000001s)]
*  of gene replacement, genetic disease, Mendelian, you know, trait. And this has been, you know, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=931.08s)]
*  successful for a lot of companies, a lot of investors and patients, but not a lot of patients. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=939.64s)]
*  Right. So because these areas are very severe, high in need, but tend to affect fairly modest [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=946.0400000000001s)]
*  patient populations. And so, you know, even going back to avalanche, the idea was, you know, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=954.44s)]
*  we know that this target is important, but delivery is a problem. So how can we get away [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=961.5600000000001s)]
*  from injections into the eye every four weeks for the rest of your life? Wouldn't it be nice [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=968.84s)]
*  to have something that lasts longer? And can gene therapy be used as a biofactory, if you will, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=972.9200000000001s)]
*  to create the protein? You know, we say instead of making it, you know, over in South San Francisco [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=978.36s)]
*  in a big bioreactor and then splitting it up into millions of patients, and I can we inject [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=983.56s)]
*  something in one patient's eye and have those cells themselves make the therapeutic protein [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=987.56s)]
*  that continues to last. And so that's been a hypothesis for, you know, a long time. And I [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=993.56s)]
*  think there was at first, I don't know, resistance, which is unfamiliarity with this idea, because [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1000.1999999999999s)]
*  gene therapy and genetic disease sort of went hand in hand. But as people started to think about, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1005.7199999999999s)]
*  how do we learn so much about the manufacturing, the regulatory, the quality control, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1010.4399999999999s)]
*  the immunology of these gene therapy vectors? How can we sort of leverage all of those tools [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1017.88s)]
*  into major diseases that affect a lot of people that still have very high immunity? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1024.84s)]
*  So certainly osteoarthritis is, you know, leads that list. Drug delivery to the joints is very, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1029.32s)]
*  very difficult. And recombinant proteins or small molecules, whether you inject them in the joint, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1034.76s)]
*  they quickly leave the joint. If you inject them systemically, they really don't reach the joint [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1040.76s)]
*  in very high concentrations. And so how do we sort of flip that narrative into a local, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1045.64s)]
*  long lasting delivery following a single injection? And so, you know, as Anita Caravalla, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1050.68s)]
*  who's our co-founder of Genesense, who had, you know, become familiar with this project when she [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1057.48s)]
*  was at Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh in graduate school and sort of brought this idea of, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1062.04s)]
*  you know, we're interested in gene therapy for common diseases. Can we do this in joints for [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1066.84s)]
*  osteoarthritis? And so we, you know, worked with Chris Evans, who had moved from Pittsburgh to the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1070.36s)]
*  Mayo Clinic and his other longtime collaborators, Paul Robbins and Steve Gozzani to take the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1074.52s)]
*  technology that they've worked on so long in terms of the molecular mechanisms of osteoarthritis [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1083.3999999999999s)]
*  into, you know, a commercial entity and be able to bring that forward in terms of, you know, real [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1088.76s)]
*  development. Part of it came from the University of Florida as well? That's right. So Steve Gozzani [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1093.9599999999998s)]
*  had gone from, I mentioned Chris Evans went from Pitt to Mayo Clinic. His longtime postdoc went [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1099.2399999999998s)]
*  from Pitt to University of Florida and had in large part actually been attracted to be at Florida [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  because the vet school has a very active equine research program. And so, you know, it turns out [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1111.8s)]
*  that horses actually get naturally occurring osteoarthritis, which turns out to be the closest [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1119.72s)]
*  thing to the human disease that, you know, that we see in the preclinical world. And so the ability [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1125.8799999999999s)]
*  to, you know, model that in horses and then, and use that large animal model. And I think that's [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1133.8s)]
*  been a really a key success factor for gene therapies is the ability to scale up in preclinically [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1139.48s)]
*  so that then we can just scale over. And you think about the early experience in, you know, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1146.44s)]
*  Liebers-Kinjano-Limerosis for Lyxterna or in, you know, with the hemophilia products where those were, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1149.8s)]
*  you know, proven out in large animal models before going clinical. And that was sort of the ability [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1155.32s)]
*  to, you know, really learn a lot with these preclinical models. So you weren't kind of scaling [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1159.96s)]
*  up and moving into humans at the same time. You were doing, you know, sequentially. And I think [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1166.44s)]
*  that's been a key success factor for the field. My quick aside here, my daughter had a show horse, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1171.4s)]
*  a quarter horse, when she was very little, who developed, the mayor developed osteoarthritis. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1179.0800000000002s)]
*  And I took the horse to the Cleveland Equine Clinic and had images taken. And the veterinarian [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1184.6000000000001s)]
*  came out after taking the images and said, the good news is this horse's arthritis is so [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1190.3600000000001s)]
*  progressed that it doesn't know which leg to limp on. So you can't tell that she's limping [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1195.08s)]
*  half the time. And she's very safe for your daughter because she's not going to want to jump. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1200.52s)]
*  So you prompted that story. No, that's exactly right. It's very common. Lameness in horses is a [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1205.56s)]
*  huge issue. And of course, it's a large weight bearing joint, just like humans with hips and knees [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1210.52s)]
*  have large weight bearing joints that, you know, unfortunately over time degenerate, right? It's [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1215.72s)]
*  one of the most common degenerative diseases. It's just that it's local in one or more joints, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1221.0s)]
*  you know, as we age and of course, brought about by, you know, like many diseases of aging, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1226.6s)]
*  you know, complex etiology. But we think that by blocking interleukin 1, which is the lead [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1233.56s)]
*  inflammatory actor and also causes cartilage degeneration. In fact, the original name for it [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1239.56s)]
*  was catabolin because it catabolizes tissue, that by blocking this important central bad actor, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1243.64s)]
*  that we can hopefully have an impact for patients. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1249.32s)]
*  You, you, when you take a genetic therapy to a common condition, like osteoarthritis, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1253.24s)]
*  or glaucoma for that matter, do you face some of the same, like logistics and distribution [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1261.48s)]
*  and supply chain challenges that the field has been struggling with for years now? Or is the [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1268.76s)]
*  manufacturing and distribution paradigm somehow different? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1277.4s)]
*  So it's interesting. I think in some ways it's easier and in some ways it's much harder because [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1281.8s)]
*  there are, you know, very different dynamics of play. So when you think about, you know, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1285.16s)]
*  a systemic application of gene therapy, you know, these are often dosed at, you know, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1290.04s)]
*  five times 10 to the 14th vector genomes per kilogram, right? So that could be, you know, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1295.96s)]
*  doing the math. I mean, one times 10 to the 16th total vector genome particles, right? Or more. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1301.8799999999999s)]
*  That's a lot of vector to manufacture and the cost of doing that is very high. And these are rare [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1312.36s)]
*  diseases, so it's justifiable to charge high prices because you're having a huge impact on [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1318.04s)]
*  the patient's, you know, health and outcomes and lifespan. And so all, you know, whether it's a [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1324.68s)]
*  gene therapy or protein therapy, rare disease medications are, you know, more expensive, right? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1331.64s)]
*  But when you are thinking about bringing this forward to a very common disease, you face a [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1337.88s)]
*  totally different, you know, pricing paradigm. You can't charge $3 million for a product without [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1344.1200000000001s)]
*  serial price. And you wouldn't want to be completely economically, you know, infeasible. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1349.16s)]
*  And so the idea is, okay, if we want to charge, you know, something that's, you know, a five-figure [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1355.4s)]
*  price tag instead of a six or seven-figure price tag, how do we go about doing that? Well, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1361.16s)]
*  one of the things is that the cost of goods needs to be, you know, in order to be a business, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1365.24s)]
*  the cost of goods needs to be much lower. So, you know, thinking about that, systemic doses [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1368.92s)]
*  and common diseases are currently, you know, not workable because the systemic dose costs [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1376.76s)]
*  six figures to make. You can't sell for five figures. That's not a business. But, you know, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1382.6s)]
*  the diseases that we've worked on, whether they're ocular or whether they're intraarticular [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1388.28s)]
*  injection are far lower doses, like 10,000 fold lower than a systemic administration. And that [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1392.84s)]
*  means that cost of goods are, you know, very approachable. If we scale in the right way, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1398.76s)]
*  that we can get it down to the four figures or maybe the high three figures [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1404.9199999999998s)]
*  in terms of the cost of being in therapies. So at the same time, I think we run into other [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1409.4799999999998s)]
*  sort of new challenges, right? So when you're charging a very high price for a drug, you know, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1416.76s)]
*  the way that these companies for rare diseases currently think about distribution is they work [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1422.04s)]
*  through distributors to kind of take orders, but oftentimes they ship directly, you know, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1427.6399999999999s)]
*  on dry ice or on liquid nitrogen to a tertiary academic medical center who has all the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1432.04s)]
*  hospital pharmacy and facilities to be able to receive that, to store it for as long as they [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1437.56s)]
*  need and then to administer it to the patient. And the several thousand dollar cost of doing [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1442.52s)]
*  that shipment is inconsequential, right, to the price and the overall cost of the medicine. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1447.1599999999999s)]
*  I think in common diseases, you know, we're facing a very different kind of a dynamic where if we're [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1454.92s)]
*  trying to make it and deliver it to the patient for, you know, a thousand dollars, a two thousand [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1459.48s)]
*  dollar shipment cost is completely impossible and feasible, right? So what that means is that, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1465.72s)]
*  you know, we need to do this through sort of a traditional distribution pathway like biologics, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1472.68s)]
*  you know, like Luscentis, which I worked on in Genentech are distributed today. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1481.0s)]
*  And the cost of doing that is, you know, much more to the unit economics. But that being said, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  we don't expect that every single, just as an example, every single clinic will have a minus [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1490.2s)]
*  80 degree freezer. And so, you know, generating the kind of stability data that will let us, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1494.76s)]
*  you know, that's compatible with distributions to every single clinic, not just tertiary academic [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1501.32s)]
*  medical center. So these are, you know, just some examples of some of the challenges that, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1507.32s)]
*  you know, we faced and then, you know, are overcoming or have overcome on the way to, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1511.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, delivering on the promise for gene therapy for common diseases. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1516.84s)]
*  Our friends at Alston and Bird set us up with some amazing space to record during JPM week. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1522.04s)]
*  The firm's National Healthcare and Life Sciences practice has more than a hundred attorneys [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1528.28s)]
*  actively involved in the healthcare industry across the full spectrum of legal disciplines. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1533.08s)]
*  The signature strength of this practice is its ability to master complex representations [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1539.3200000000002s)]
*  that draw on the coordinated expertise of its regulatory, compliance, public policy, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1544.76s)]
*  transactional, corporate governance, securities, FDA, biotech, IP, government investigations, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1550.76s)]
*  and litigation practice areas. Alston and Bird represents life sciences companies and their [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1559.48s)]
*  partners in corporate stages ranging from private to newly public to well-established [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1565.16s)]
*  and in a variety of stages of product development from preclinical to post-approval commercial [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1571.24s)]
*  launch. Learn more at Alston.com and tell them you learned about them on the business of biotech. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1576.68s)]
*  The regulatory paradigm occurs, it occurs to me that there's got to be a challenge there too, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1585.0s)]
*  regulatory bodies that are evaluating or prosecuting genetic therapies for rare disease, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1590.28s)]
*  ultra rare disease, I'm assuming tend to be a little bit more liberal than someone who comes [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1597.96s)]
*  along and says, hey, we're developing a gene therapy for an indication that has a giant [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1605.0s)]
*  patient population. I can imagine the agencies would be like, all right, let's pump the brakes [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1610.9199999999998s)]
*  here a little bit. This is a modality that we haven't necessarily seen a lot of broad [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1614.68s)]
*  patient population applicability. Well, also, I mean, yes and no. So I mean, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1621.4s)]
*  you think about rare diseases and the bar is, I don't want to say necessarily lower, but certainly [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1625.4s)]
*  it's infeasible to run multiple large trials in rare diseases because there aren't enough patients [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1631.64s)]
*  to recruit or find or treat. And so certain, and the risk of mass exposure to huge populations [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1638.84s)]
*  isn't there. And so the idea of a rare safety event becoming a major public health problem [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1646.6s)]
*  just doesn't really exist. And so that framework for rare diseases is sort of over here. The [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1653.56s)]
*  framework for common diseases has existed for a long time with small molecules, with biologics, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1659.8799999999999s)]
*  et cetera. And it is feasible to do large studies and it is certainly going to be used [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1665.48s)]
*  in large populations. So yes, FDA and EMA and other regulatory agencies want you to characterize [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1674.52s)]
*  those, the safety profile. In other words, those adverse events. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1681.08s)]
*  But to say that products like this haven't been used in those populations, I mean, that's not [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1686.1200000000001s)]
*  quite right. When we think about what was the first gene therapy, it was probably the polio [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1690.28s)]
*  vaccine, right? Back, and this is given to millions of healthy people, including kids. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1695.08s)]
*  And so the bar for vaccines being very broadly distributed and in healthy people rather than [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1703.0s)]
*  sick patients is very, very high, right? And probably rightly so. And so I think probably [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1712.36s)]
*  the gene therapy for common diseases is somewhere in between. These are sick patients, but it's a [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1720.04s)]
*  large population. So of course we have to go characterize them. I think, of course, the office [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1724.12s)]
*  of OTP within CBER has their own way of doing things that's separate from the device division [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1732.44s)]
*  and separate from the drugs division. And so we're in the process, the genescence of going to [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1739.24s)]
*  talk to the agency this year about phase two design and sort of future development program. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1745.56s)]
*  And so I think we'll learn more. There are phase three programs that are in large indications, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1750.6799999999998s)]
*  for example, for vacuolar degeneration. And we're entering phase two. So we're going to learn more [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1756.6s)]
*  and more about how regulatory agencies are thinking about these and common diseases. But the [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1761.0s)]
*  framework is sort of already laid out by vaccines and by other major indications where biologics [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1765.8s)]
*  and small molecules have come before us. Do you have a sense of how large your phase two will be? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1771.88s)]
*  The phase two for genescence is really going to be designed to provide clinical proof of [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1778.44s)]
*  concept. So that's a pain and function study. And we'll also look at structural end points. So [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1783.4s)]
*  we'll look at MRIs of how the joints are doing. And so we think that's going to be about 250 [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1788.68s)]
*  patients in this phase two. So certainly not tiny, but certainly not huge either. I think you [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1794.2s)]
*  certainly can study in a well-designed pain trial. You can certainly see clinical symptom improvement [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1801.32s)]
*  in osteoarthritis patients with OA of the knee. As you're talking to investors and you're gearing [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1809.24s)]
*  up to launch a clinical trial, what do you see in terms of the financing environment? And I guess [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1817.08s)]
*  what questions do you get from investors when you're telling them we're developing a gene [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1826.2s)]
*  therapy for an indication like osteoarthritis for the knee? Well, certainly from an investment [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1829.8s)]
*  perspective, these last two to three years have not been what the previous seven or eight years [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1834.76s)]
*  were. And I think everybody recognizes that the investors became more selective, the markets been [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1842.6s)]
*  down, insurance rates have been high, whatever the sort of drivers of the market have been, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1847.08s)]
*  it's been more difficult to finance companies privately. It's been more difficult to do IPOs [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1853.96s)]
*  and prices and valuations are down. And so I see that as an investor and of course as an operator [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1858.76s)]
*  and entrepreneur as well. I think investment groups are different and they all have different [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1866.28s)]
*  theses and that's wonderful because they have different ideas of what the future holds. And [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1872.28s)]
*  some investors are going to say osteoarthritis, not for me, it's a very difficult area. And some [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1877.0s)]
*  are going to say, wow, this is the biggest opportunity in all of biotech. Why? Because [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1883.48s)]
*  when you're putting together a huge patient population, 32 million Americans with osteoarthritis, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1889.4s)]
*  1.2 million new cases of knee osteoarthritis every year, huge patient population together with a [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1896.92s)]
*  massive unmet need, there are no therapies. All we have is pain control and sort of temporary [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1905.48s)]
*  symptomatology. Nothing really treats the underlying disease. And so these two things [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1913.0s)]
*  together really drive an enormous opportunity space. And so that's what got us excited. Hey, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1917.08s)]
*  people have been trying to block this target for a long time. No one's been successful. We think we [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1922.68s)]
*  can do this with gene therapy and now with the latest clinical data we've shown, we can express [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1926.84s)]
*  this at the target levels in these patients' joints for the long term. So what's next? Okay, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1932.84s)]
*  we need to run a proper phase two to really show the value of it. From your seat as CEO, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1938.36s)]
*  and then also from an investor perspective, are you optimistic this year about public markets, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1947.56s)]
*  about cash coming into biotech? What's your read on 2025? I think it's too soon to tell. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1954.36s)]
*  Obviously, there's been a lot of chatter in the hallways. This week, JPMorgan, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1960.84s)]
*  Healthcare Week in San Francisco about, oh, is 2025 looking more optimistic? I think that was [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1965.08s)]
*  the headline this morning. That sort of deal announcement has driven sort of a more upbeat [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1971.0s)]
*  tenor. I've heard other people say this feels a lot like 2023 and 2024. So I don't know. I won't [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1977.8s)]
*  look into my crystal ball too hard. I'm sort of certainly hopeful that inflation coming down, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1984.4399999999998s)]
*  perhaps interest rates coming down, and the markets sort of back to normalizing and rewarding [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1992.6s)]
*  innovation. Certainly hope for that on all our behalf in the biotech industry, that 2025 will [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=1998.12s)]
*  be a great year. You mentioned, you're talking about the investment community and the different [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2004.9199999999998s)]
*  appetites among different investors just a few minutes ago. And it seems to me that when things [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2012.52s)]
*  are tight and tough, like the company you keep becomes all the more important, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2017.48s)]
*  finding those investors who do get excited about an opportunity like this. So this is a broad [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2022.8400000000001s)]
*  question, but what advice would you give a biotech builder on turning over the right rocks to find an [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2028.76s)]
*  investment partner, tough times or otherwise? Because you don't want the wrong investors either [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2036.2800000000002s)]
*  when things are flush, when there's money to be had. So what advice do you offer around [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2041.24s)]
*  finding the right investor for your specific approach? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2047.08s)]
*  I guess, you know, this is a great question. There's a few things I'd say. You know, one is [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2052.04s)]
*  that you never really know who your investors are going to be. And you can hypothesize that [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2055.64s)]
*  there's a great strategic fit for this fund or this company. And I find that, you know, very rarely [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2061.32s)]
*  are you, is that have a strong predictive value, right? What you think someone should be interested [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2067.24s)]
*  in, you know, doesn't necessarily correlate to what their internal discussions, you know, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2073.4s)]
*  are mapping out the strategy for that company or that fund. So, you know, therefore you really [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2078.12s)]
*  don't know what meetings are going to be useful. So take meetings because you may learn something, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2084.6800000000003s)]
*  you may get an introduction, you may, something may surprise you. Another thing is that, you know, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2089.7200000000003s)]
*  it's easier if investors declare themselves, right? And so getting out there at academic [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2094.2000000000003s)]
*  conferences to talk about your science, putting press releases out, say, you know, here's where [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2101.4s)]
*  we are sort of being open about and broadcasting, you know, this is where we are and kind of what [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2105.48s)]
*  we're working on and what we hope to do actually will help investors who are interested declare [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2112.76s)]
*  themselves. And that's easier than reaching out to, you know, hundreds or thousands of different [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2117.32s)]
*  funds. And so sometimes that's a, you know, a good strategy. I'd say, you know, in terms of, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2122.92s)]
*  you know, who are the right investor partners, in my experience, it's very hard to predict, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2128.44s)]
*  you know, going in and sort of just by the tenor of, you know, the conversations, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2134.2000000000003s)]
*  what those relationships are going to be like, you know, four years down the road when things [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2140.28s)]
*  get tough, right? That's actually quite hard to predict. But it is possible to align incentives [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2145.16s)]
*  to some extent and sort of pick the, pick investors who are going to share incentives. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2150.36s)]
*  So if you have a long term strategy and you need investors that are going to be there for a while, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2156.52s)]
*  pick someone who has that long term mindset that can be patient capital that's not going to want [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2162.28s)]
*  you to, you know, do an IPO in six months. Right. I think it's possible to sort of align those [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2166.84s)]
*  incentives. Obviously, you know, people's reputation, talk to other companies that they've [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2172.04s)]
*  worked with in the past and sort of get a read on, you know, what was this investor like when [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2179.0s)]
*  things were going great? What were they like when things were going not so great? How helpful were [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2184.52s)]
*  they in terms of, you know, helping you overcome your challenges? And so, you know, certainly those [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2188.44s)]
*  are all helpful. And, you know, look, it's kind of fancy to prognosticate and say, oh, this is exactly [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2193.0s)]
*  the type of investor that I would want to have in this company. But at the end of the day, like, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2203.0s)]
*  you have to eat the food that's on the table. And so, you know, if every company were so lucky that, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2208.04s)]
*  we have 20 different sets of opportunities to choose from and you can optimize who you want [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2214.04s)]
*  to work with, like, wow, amazing. That's wonderful. In my experience, that's not every time. Right. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2220.04s)]
*  That's a little bit of a rare moment or a rare company. And so, you know, often a deal is [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2225.1600000000003s)]
*  available and that's the one you're going to do. And I think, you know, most entrepreneurs will [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2232.28s)]
*  realize, you know, that's kind of the realpolitik of, you know, biotech entrepreneurship and, you [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2235.32s)]
*  know, early stage raising capital. I like the use of the word fancy there. It's kind of fancy. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2242.84s)]
*  Let's not get too fancy. Right. I have a similarly broad question that I wanted to ask based on [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2249.1600000000003s)]
*  something you said earlier. I think you got to know the Boston area ecosystem through Uncorus [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2255.88s)]
*  and you mentioned you wanted to come back to San Francisco. What do you like or dislike? I guess, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2262.52s)]
*  how would you compare Boston and California for, you know, a biotech company that's looking for [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2268.6s)]
*  funding or that's, you know, doing science? Which do you like better and why? I'm going to jump in [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2274.52s)]
*  before he responds. He's a native Californian. He's a Matlow Park guy. So he's probably going [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2281.3199999999997s)]
*  to give you a biased response. Just like you had to work at the University of Florida into your [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2285.56s)]
*  question earlier, Ben's an Orlando guy. He was giving a shout out to the home state here. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2291.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, so you're of course, you're absolutely right. So I'm from California, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2296.2799999999997s)]
*  from Matlow Park originally and, you know, sort of changed a lot in the last 40 plus years. But [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2299.7999999999997s)]
*  being from here, you know, I think the biotech ecosystem was more mature faster in California [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2307.64s)]
*  than it was in Boston because you had Genentech and you had sort of companies that had grown all [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2314.52s)]
*  the way up from startups to commercial, you know, large pharma commercial entities, right? And that [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2319.72s)]
*  was certainly true, you know, 10, 15 years ago, probably more true here than it was in Boston [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2327.64s)]
*  when we were kind of getting around the time we were getting on CoroSart. But look, the Boston [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2336.68s)]
*  ecosystem has just grown so enormously with big pharma setting up shop there with university [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2340.68s)]
*  collaborations. And one of the delights about being in Boston is that it's all extremely [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2345.88s)]
*  concentrated in kind of Kendall Square area. And then of course, you have, you know, other [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2350.2000000000003s)]
*  businesses that are out in, you know, Waltham and other areas. But there's such a vibrant biotech [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2355.8s)]
*  community, you know, in Boston. At the same time, you know, Palo Alto still has such an amazing [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2362.44s)]
*  entrepreneurial ecosystem and vibe. And I think, you know, one of the I was asking you, you know, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2369.64s)]
*  in the elevator right up, if you watch the HBO show Silicon Valley, because it's this just incredible [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2376.92s)]
*  sort of, you know, art imitating a life parody of Silicon Valley, and you watch that show, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2382.92s)]
*  you know, living here and you recognize all these patterns, right? And there's a real joy to being [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2388.92s)]
*  an entrepreneur in this area, because the ecosystem is so rich in terms of all the supporting [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2395.08s)]
*  elements. But also because I think, you know, people are really sort of, you know, culturally [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2400.6s)]
*  rewarded for taking risks, and rewarded for thinking big and thinking bold and being brave. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2409.08s)]
*  And so that's, that's, you know, we're incredibly lucky right here in the Bay Area and Silicon [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2414.68s)]
*  Valley to be part of a culture that says, Yeah, that's possible. Let's dream about a world where [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2420.84s)]
*  that could be true. Does Silicon Valley have the tech bio leg up on biotech in Boston? Like, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2427.88s)]
*  do you see a differentiation there in terms of the approach? I mean, perhaps because there's so [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2435.2400000000002s)]
*  much, you know, technology and AI and so many engineers here and so many tech investors [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2440.52s)]
*  are, you know, in this area. So you do see a lot of things happening here and every wave of the [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2447.0s)]
*  newest thing sort of seems to always be in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. At the same time, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2453.48s)]
*  of course, you have, you know, incredible, you know, computer scientists, you know, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2457.96s)]
*  coming at MIT and Harvard and in Boston as well. And, you know, and so I do see a lot of, you know, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2461.24s)]
*  kind of research and platform companies, you know, coming out of the Boston area that are just, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2469.56s)]
*  you know, just absolutely tremendously innovative. Yeah, I haven't seen the statistics [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2473.48s)]
*  for 2024, but I know for a number of years running, Boston has held the top title for NIH grants. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2477.16s)]
*  So NIH science grants, you know, for- Yeah, you have MIT, you have Harvard, you have all the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2485.4s)]
*  hospitals there as well. So it's a tremendous ecosystem. And, you know, in the Bay Area, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2490.76s)]
*  it's big, but it's awfully spread out. So I think that's, you know, if you talk to employees, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2495.16s)]
*  they're probably frustrated by the long commutes in the Bay Area versus [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2499.08s)]
*  jumping on the Red Line to go to Kendall Square. Well, I noticed coming up 101 from the airport, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2502.52s)]
*  and I didn't remember this, and maybe I just, it was cloudy the last few times I've been through, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2507.88s)]
*  but all, you know, there are a ton of big pharma buildings right there, you know, in South San [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2512.12s)]
*  Francisco. Is that newer or have they had shops there for a while? Well, Genentech certainly has [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2517.48s)]
*  for a long time. And then I think through acquisitions, others have bill of presences [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2523.16s)]
*  there as well. Well, yeah, I mean Merck, AbbVie, I mean big name companies, you know, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2527.56s)]
*  with their names on top of big buildings along 101 there. Yeah. Let's reel it back into [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2531.56s)]
*  Genesense and get a little bit of a sense for where you are right now and what the next [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2538.36s)]
*  significant inflection points might look like. Sure. So Genesense, you know, as I mentioned, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2543.88s)]
*  is developing a product for osteoarthritis that blocks interleukin-1, which is the major bad actor. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2549.88s)]
*  And this is a response for pain and inflammation, but also for cartilage degeneration. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2556.36s)]
*  And so the initial first human study was run by Chris Evans at Mayo Clinic, and this was back in, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2561.32s)]
*  you know, approximately 2022. And then we, Genesense was, you know, spun that technology out and [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2567.2400000000002s)]
*  completed our series A, and then we got a CIRM grant from the California Institute of Regenerative [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2575.88s)]
*  Medicine. And those two, you know, financings together allowed us to progress into the next [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2579.32s)]
*  stage, which was a phase 1B clinical study. So we call it .LO in keeping with the Renaissance [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2584.12s)]
*  theme of Genesense. And the idea, you know, there were a couple objectives. One was to, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2590.3599999999997s)]
*  it was dose ranging with and without immune conditioning because so many gene therapy protocols [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2595.7999999999997s)]
*  have some kind of immune conditioning, whether it's with steroids or biologics, to see if you [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2602.12s)]
*  can improve safety and efficacy of the gene therapy by modulating the immune system. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2608.76s)]
*  So nobody had tried this in the joint before, so we were quite innovative thinking about, gee, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2614.1200000000003s)]
*  is there a role here for immunosuppression? We didn't have any in the phase 1, the first [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2619.0800000000004s)]
*  demand at Mayo Clinic. Should we bring that forward to the phase 1B and test whether there, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2623.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, whether we can get any insights? And so we started that study, let's think about this, in [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2627.4s)]
*  2023 and began enrollment toward the end of 2023. We completed enrollment and now [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2634.52s)]
*  we finished the six-month follow-up. We announced the data from that follow-up [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2645.4s)]
*  just last week, leading up to Jayden Morgan's six-month data. And the conclusions are, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2653.56s)]
*  you know, really it was safe across all doses tested and, you know, regardless with and without [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2658.76s)]
*  the immune conditioning and whether that immune conditioning was a short course of oral steroids [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2663.88s)]
*  or whether it was a very brief course of oral with an intraarticular injection of steroids. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2670.1200000000003s)]
*  And so it was well tolerated across all those cohorts. And importantly, in multiple groups, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2674.6800000000003s)]
*  we saw an increase in the transgene, which is interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2680.6800000000003s)]
*  to our target levels in the synovial fluid, so inside the knee joints of these patients. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2688.2000000000003s)]
*  So throughout, we were sampling the synovial fluid from the patients to test that in a [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2694.1200000000003s)]
*  qualified clinical assay. Are we seeing, you know, levels of the transgene, the IL-1RA, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2698.6800000000003s)]
*  increase? And the answer was yes, it was getting target levels and it's lasting six months. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2706.2000000000003s)]
*  So that's terrific news. So now we know we can, you know, have the pharma dynamic effect that [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2710.36s)]
*  we're looking for. And, you know, what's next is to say, okay, we know we can intervene in this [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2714.84s)]
*  pathway. It's been a long standing hypothesis that interleukin-1 is important in OA symptoms [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2722.2000000000003s)]
*  and disease progression. Now, can we bring that forward into a proper clinical proof of concept [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2729.56s)]
*  study, looking at pain and function and looking at, and starting to look at joint structure to see [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2734.2000000000003s)]
*  do patients improve symptomatically? And can that last long-term following a single injection? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2740.44s)]
*  And what's happening? Start to ask the question as an exploratory implement, what's happening to [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2747.32s)]
*  the joints of these patients over time? Are they actually improving in terms of inflammation? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2753.0s)]
*  And are we seeing a trend toward improvement in cartilage and other markers of disease [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2758.2000000000003s)]
*  progression of MRI? So we launched a series B to try to fund that study. And so, you know, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2764.68s)]
*  very, very early stages of that. And so, you know, hopefully we'll get some good feedback from [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2773.56s)]
*  investors in the coming weeks. We also have a plan to go talk to FDA about what's next. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2779.24s)]
*  Yeah. Which that's a beautiful segue into what you're doing here this week, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2785.24s)]
*  like specifically what you're doing here this week. We all know what we're doing here this week. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2790.76s)]
*  What are you doing specifically here this week to perhaps contribute to that series B? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2795.1600000000003s)]
*  Certainly doing a lot of walking around, at least it's not raining or hailing this year, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2801.1600000000003s)]
*  which is an improvement. The sunshine has been more than welcome. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2804.28s)]
*  So, you know, certainly spending time with investors, but I would say, you know, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2810.28s)]
*  a lot of investors these days tend to want to meet outside of this week because they're so busy with, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2814.76s)]
*  you know, portfolio companies. So most of our, you know, investor meetings are sort of next week [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2819.72s)]
*  and the following week. We also like to use this week as an opportunity to talk to strategic [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2825.56s)]
*  partners that, you know, may be more diffuse in the ecosystem, you know, coming from Europe or [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2830.8399999999997s)]
*  coming from, you know, different parts of the U.S. and also to catch up with, you know, folks who [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2835.3999999999996s)]
*  have been following our story to kind of give them an update. So a little bit of everything [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2840.8399999999997s)]
*  and more to come. Yeah, yeah, excellent. Well, it's a great place to be doing a little bit of [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2847.56s)]
*  everything and working towards that more to come. Indeed. And I, like I said, I know this is an [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2852.44s)]
*  incredibly busy week for you, so I appreciate you spending at least a small chunk of it with us. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2857.8799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. It's great to be here. Yeah, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WcaUi8punY&t=2863.24s)]
