Video Description: Gavin Samuels, M.D. found his work as an intensive care physician boring. After earning his M.D., he did that for a few years before moving into intensive care management roles. It wasn't until he left the hospital and entered biopharma that he found his footing, cutting his teeth in business development at places like Merck, Pfizer, Quark Pharma, and Teva. He even headed growth strategy at Lonza for a while. Now, he's Chief Business Officer and General Partner at CinRx Pharma, where a deep pipeline of early- to late-stage candidates keeps him on his dealmaking toes. Within minutes of our conversation, Dr. Samuels' introspective reflections on biotech dealmaking and negotiations planted this episode firmly on the Business of Biotech podcast highlight reel.

*  I try not to play favorites, but within minutes of our conversation starting, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=40.16s)]
*  Dr. Gavin Samuels became one of my favorite guests on the business of biotech. Gavin, an MD, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=44.72s)]
*  was an intensive care physician before he joined industry. Hard to wrap my mind around, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=51.36s)]
*  but he joined industry because he got bored doing that. Bored running an intensive care unit. Can [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=56.56s)]
*  you imagine? I'm Matt Piller. This is the business of biotech, and I had the absolute pleasure to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  learn about and learn from Dr. Samuels, who's now Chief Business Officer at CINRx, when we sat down [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=67.2s)]
*  in San Francisco to record this episode. Beyond his fascinating career journey, we discussed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=73.76s)]
*  deal making in a tumultuous market, the unique buyer-seller position that CINRx finds itself in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=79.12s)]
*  What healthy tension between drug development and business development looks like. What a responsible [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=86.08s)]
*  obesity therapeutic looks like. And a whole lot more. It's a good one. Let's give it a listen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=92.0s)]
*  And I learned that before you joined CINRx in 2022, you were Lons' Head of Strategy and Growth [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=97.84s)]
*  Initiatives. You've held major roles, obviously, there. Pfizer, a host of other smaller biotechs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=106.4s)]
*  What led you, I guess, sort of a two-part question, what led you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=116.48s)]
*  away from big bio? And how did you land at CINRx? Well, I think one way of explaining it is a little [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  bit like the little Red Riding Hood story. The one bit was too big, the other one was too small, and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=128.24s)]
*  the third one is just right. Big Pharma was an excellent place to learn the industry. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=135.52s)]
*  And I was an advisor and then a tele. And if you want to learn how to do drug development, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=142.24s)]
*  those are great places. Both of them are great places to learn it. But they're massive [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  organizations, which means the bureaucracy and the process is challenging. Everything takes a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=154.8s)]
*  long time in this big teams. And innovation is difficult in big organizations. So, you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=162.32s)]
*  that was one component of my career education, if you like. And then there's a lot to be learned by [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=172.64s)]
*  a very small, nimble biotech as well, where decision making is very quick. And things [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=178.72s)]
*  have to run according to a shoestring budget often. And one can learn where you can trim down [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=186.24s)]
*  uncertain aspects. The challenge in a small biotech company is there's never enough money. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=195.68s)]
*  So trimming becomes too much sometimes. Yeah. And you start cutting corners where corners [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  shouldn't be cut. And I think CentaurX is the right size institution. It's got a lot of what [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=211.12s)]
*  Big Pharma has to offer, meaning everything is done properly. There's no corners cut. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=218.08s)]
*  But at the same time, you have the rapid decision making and innovation, which allows for a very [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  efficient and effective drug development process. It's kind of the best of both worlds, which is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=230.4s)]
*  where I personally feel most comfortable and where I can feel from a personality and an experience [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=236.4s)]
*  perspective, I'm able to make the most contribution in that size organization. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That was the next follow-up question I have for you on that was like, what do you think it is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=248.48s)]
*  that's different about someone who, you know, it's not an uncommon refrain, right? To start in a big [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=253.44s)]
*  bio and then to move to a smaller bio. Yeah. Like you said, you found sort of a happy medium, but, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=260.24s)]
*  you know, a lot of people land in a place like Pfizer or Teva or Lanza and they stay there for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=265.68s)]
*  their entire, their entire period. They can and they can. What do you think it takes differently [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=270.56s)]
*  within someone who says, you know what, I want to take the risk of agility in a leadership position? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=275.92s)]
*  Yes. So I think it comes down to a large extent to one's personality, which in turn informs on [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=282.24s)]
*  one's risk tolerance. Certainly at, when I was at Pfizer, there was the possibility of a very long [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=290.32s)]
*  career trajectory. That was not very stressful at all and very comfortable in terms of resources and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=298.48s)]
*  large teams where everyone had their area of expertise. But I've always been someone who [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=307.52s)]
*  enjoys a challenge and enjoys learning something new. And I'm very comfortable when I don't exactly [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=314.96s)]
*  know how I'm supposed to do the thing, the task that's in front of me and to kind of stretching [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=322.0s)]
*  myself to figure out a solution. So it's not so common in a big pharma company to do that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  So I think the single most important factor in determining what the right size organization [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=335.12s)]
*  is for a person is their own personality, their level of risk tolerance, their desire to make a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  difference. It's difficult to make a difference in a big clunky organization. It's much easier [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=349.12s)]
*  to make a difference in an agile, rapidly evolving, rapidly growing organization. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=355.28s)]
*  When you say make a difference, you mean like a personal contribution that you can sort of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=360.88s)]
*  feel and measure toward the solution? It manifests on various levels. At the end of the day, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=365.84s)]
*  I went into healthcare because I'm passionate about wanting to make a difference in people's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=371.52s)]
*  lives. Meaning to improve quality of life, whether that means the ability to cure disease or at least [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=376.56s)]
*  improve the quality of someone's disease burden. That's the primary focus. That's what gets me out [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  of bed in the morning and most of my colleagues at Sonorex. So one can achieve that much more [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=395.6s)]
*  tangibly in a small organization than in a big organization. And then also when you, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=403.20000000000005s)]
*  one of many people working on a project, let's say a transaction, for example, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=410.48s)]
*  when you're one of many people working on it, it's not that easy to really [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=416.32000000000005s)]
*  feel that what you're doing has a direct correlation with whether the deal is successful [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=423.68s)]
*  or not. Whereas in a small organization, it's all on you and either you make it happen or you don't. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=429.76s)]
*  So I enjoy the challenge, the pressure and the challenge and eventually, you know, the success [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=435.68s)]
*  of knowing that these two hands actually made a difference. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know, rewinding even further, you and it's sort of, I guess, pulling the same [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=447.68s)]
*  thread, right? Of decisions you made along your career trajectory. You were in your MD and you [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  were a clinician, right? You practiced medicine? I did practice medicine. I was working in intensive [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  care. And I did that. I practiced for eight years. The reason that I decided to change probably [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=469.92s)]
*  surprised most people. I got bored with clinical medicine and I got bored with a particular branch [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  of clinical medicine, which is intensive care. And it doesn't seem like that would be, you know, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=484.72s)]
*  to a layman like me, that doesn't seem like it would be boring at all. You're right. So it seems [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=489.36s)]
*  difficult to understand how that could be boring. But if you understand how intensive care works, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=495.2s)]
*  it's all algorithm based. So you have a particular patient and they have a particular set of symptoms [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  or a particular presentation and you fall back on an algorithm. You do this test. If it shows this, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=509.52s)]
*  you do this. And if it's yes, you follow this path. And if it's no, you follow this path. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=515.76s)]
*  And eventually after a number of years, that algorithm becomes internalized. And it's a bit [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=520.72s)]
*  like driving a car, not actually thinking that much. It's kind of automatic. And what I found [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=526.64s)]
*  frustrating about that is that I felt like I was not thinking. There was certainly no creativity in [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=532.72s)]
*  the intensive care unit. It's all following an algorithm. And I felt like I wasn't using my brain. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=541.12s)]
*  And it happens to be that my wife was doing an MBA at the time. And she said, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=548.0s)]
*  why don't you do a few subjects just for fun? And I did. And it was amazing because it was a [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=552.96s)]
*  completely different way of thinking to medical science. It was almost the opposite. In medical [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=558.6400000000001s)]
*  science, you take a whole lot of data and you try and funnel it down into a diagnosis. In business [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  studies, you're almost doing the opposite. You take an idea and try and expand it out into something. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=571.2800000000001s)]
*  What I really enjoy is the combination, the medical science with the business component of it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=576.8s)]
*  Yeah. So when you joined industry, you did so with the... Because this was another, I guess, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  transitionary question in my mind. Again, it's not uncommon for people who practice medicine, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  for doctors to join industry, often in chief scientific or chief medical officer roles. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  The chief business officer role is maybe less common for a clinician to get into. So when you [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  made the decision to join industry, you did so fully intending to learn the business side and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=605.84s)]
*  go into that side? Or were you in more of a scientific role? I started off in a more scientific [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=613.76s)]
*  role and then moved into the intersection between clinical development and commercialization, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=621.2s)]
*  meaning how do you set up a clinical trial that meets the endpoints that could also justify [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=629.36s)]
*  various regulatory indications that support the commercial aspects of the drug development. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  And then from that, there was a natural progression to move more to the transaction side. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=646.64s)]
*  Once I moved into the transaction side, I knew I'd land. This is where I wanted to be, because [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=652.16s)]
*  the substrate of the transaction is still the drug, or often an early stage drug, which relies [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=658.64s)]
*  on a good understanding of the science, the medical science, which I enjoyed, but also [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=664.0s)]
*  understanding risk and uncertainty over time in drug development, and then constructing a transaction [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=669.6800000000001s)]
*  that is appropriate for both sides of that transaction, given the risk and uncertainty [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=679.2s)]
*  over time. And if you can crack that, that results in a transaction that's useful for both parties [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=685.52s)]
*  and ultimately can benefit the patients in treating positions as well. Yeah, it's interesting. I'm [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=692.8s)]
*  going to ask you a theoretical or philosophical question about this, because I'm thinking about [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=699.12s)]
*  it in simple terms. I'm thinking about this in a corollary fashion to the business that I'm in. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=703.6s)]
*  I'm in media, and I've been for my entire career. So we create content, all sorts of different [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=710.64s)]
*  content. We have a BD team, obviously, a business development team, a sales team. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=716.96s)]
*  I've learned over the course of my career to become very discerning about when and how I make [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  our BD folks aware of a new product, because BD folks want to sell it before it's ready. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=728.32s)]
*  So we think about that in terms of biopharmaceuticals. There's got to be at least [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=736.08s)]
*  some inherent friction, yet you, with your background, you come to the apex of those two [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=741.68s)]
*  disciplines, understanding both. Does that benefit you? Do you understand what I'm saying? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=749.12s)]
*  Does it benefit you? And at times, does it create even a hint of conflict or friction with [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=754.8s)]
*  other BD folks who want to move? It can create some... By the way, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=761.8399999999999s)]
*  my BD folks are listening to this. It can create some conflict. I prefer to think of it as creating [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=767.76s)]
*  a good tension that finds the right balance between where a drug is in its development, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=776.4s)]
*  what the risks and uncertainty are that are associated with that drug between today and [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=785.28s)]
*  when it eventually gets to the market, hopefully. And then finding a transaction between the two [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=791.4399999999999s)]
*  parties that balances and shares the risk over time. Because when a transaction is signed and [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=797.36s)]
*  the ink is derived, that's not the end, that's the beginning of the relationship often. And there's [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  a long path that needs to be traveled together. So if you've set up the transaction in a [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=810.32s)]
*  collaborative way and the entire negotiation has taken place, not in a confrontational mode, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=814.72s)]
*  but rather in a collaborative mode, that sets the stage for the long-term relationship that's good, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=821.44s)]
*  not only for both parties, but optimizes the probability of a successful drug at the end [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=827.52s)]
*  of the day. It's a win-win-win-win situation. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=832.56s)]
*  Robert Hagstrom When, if ever, does the... I have a lot of [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=835.3599999999999s)]
*  conversations with chief business officers in biotech and collaboration comes up often [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=840.64s)]
*  in negotiation. And I get the sense that that's the ideal, but I'm curious about if you'd be [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=847.28s)]
*  willing to share when there does... When conflict does appear or arise, even slight conflict, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=854.96s)]
*  what is it usually centered on? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=864.64s)]
*  Tim Weiss It often comes about because of [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=870.1600000000001s)]
*  certain issues, and there's usually more than one. There's usually a handful of issues that arise [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=875.2800000000001s)]
*  where people tend to be fixed in their position and not willing to move. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=881.8399999999999s)]
*  And a suboptimal way of dealing with that situation is to simply compromise. So, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  the simplest is around an economic parameter. I want to offer you $100. You will only receive [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=901.04s)]
*  $200. We compromise at $150, and that's halfway. Neither of us are particularly happy, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=909.76s)]
*  and neither of us are particularly unhappy. That's suboptimal. A much better approach to compromise [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=918.88s)]
*  is to say, not that you are insisting on $200, but why? What is it about the $200? What is it [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=926.0s)]
*  about your position that's important? Is it really just about the $200, or is there something else [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=938.32s)]
*  that gives us more substrate to be able to work with? So, instead of compromising, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=944.8000000000001s)]
*  you come up with a creative solution that results in both parties being happy instead of just both [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=950.48s)]
*  parties not being unhappy. Will Barron I can see why algorithms wouldn't bore you. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=956.88s)]
*  There's no algorithm for that. Another interesting challenge that you must face as CBO at [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=963.04s)]
*  CINRx is the diversity. I'm assuming it's a challenge. I'll ask for your perspective on that, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=971.76s)]
*  but the diversity of the portfolio of candidates and indications that you pursue. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  There are companies that are very narrow in focus on a specific molecule or a specific indication, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=983.2s)]
*  maybe multiple molecules for that specific indication. CINRx is not that. So, what sort [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=993.84s)]
*  of challenges does that present to you as chief business officer? I imagine, I'm going to project [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=999.2800000000001s)]
*  here a little bit, I'm assuming that your scientific and medical backgrounds lend to your ability [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1005.2800000000001s)]
*  to transact and do business across multiple products, but it's got to create some challenge. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1013.44s)]
*  It is. We're not focused in one particular therapeutic area. We have several therapeutic areas. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1020.96s)]
*  We're not agnostic, meaning we won't take on anything that comes our way, even if it is a [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1029.04s)]
*  program that's attractive. In order for us to consider a program, it has to be matched to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1035.1200000000001s)]
*  capabilities and experience within the organization. We have an advantage in that we have a strategic [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1042.0s)]
*  alliance with a very large CRO called MEPES, which spans a number of therapeutic areas. So, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1050.56s)]
*  we're able to tap into deep expertise in a number of different therapeutic areas, even if we don't [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1057.12s)]
*  have a medical director in a specific disease area, we're able to tap in often to medical [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1063.28s)]
*  people who do have expertise in that area. And we go to a lot of trouble and a lot of effort [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1072.48s)]
*  to forming good scientific advisory boards with the best and brightest minds in that particular [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1080.08s)]
*  disease area. So, it's not agnostic, but it's not overly narrow either. And we find a balance [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1087.28s)]
*  between the right number of therapeutic areas to work in without spreading ourselves too thin, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1097.68s)]
*  but always ensuring that we have either through internal people or through the ability to hire [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1103.36s)]
*  consultants or through the ability of very strong scientific advisory boards. And lastly, through our [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1109.76s)]
*  relationship with MEPES to have absolutely rock solid cutting edge world-class expertise on a [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1116.48s)]
*  particular program. Getting back to your comfort level with sort of a mid-range company being [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1123.76s)]
*  CINERAC, the company demonstrates that. So, when I think about it in very simple terms, there's buy [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1134.24s)]
*  side or sell side. And biotech typically is, we want to sell something, whether it's us or a product [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1140.32s)]
*  or a platform. And then there's big bio that's on the buy side. They want to buy them or their [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1147.9199999999998s)]
*  product or their platform. CINERAC is on both sides of this coin. I mean, you've demonstrated that [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1155.04s)]
*  recently with transactions where you're both buying and selling. I think a couple I noted here [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  were your investment in VTV. You also negotiated multi-billion dollar deals like the sale of CINC [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1165.12s)]
*  or to AstraZeneca. So, it's exemplary of being on both sides of that coin. So, well, one, I mean, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1173.04s)]
*  in your role as Chief Business Officer there, what have you had to learn? What challenges have you [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1183.4399999999998s)]
*  confronted to be able to kind of recognize good strategic deals on both sides of that equation? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1190.8s)]
*  Your question is excellent and it speaks to our particular model. What we typically do is we bring [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1199.28s)]
*  in early stage compounds. So, that's late preclinical or early clinical stage compounds. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1204.8s)]
*  And then we nurture them for a period of time, usually until phase two or midway through phase [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1211.1999999999998s)]
*  two and then we exit. So, we've got a particular area if you'd like to think of it as adolescence [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1218.56s)]
*  where we take them. So, we bring in a toddler. We give them a very loving home for a period of [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1227.2s)]
*  years and then we allow them to go out into the big wide world. And the strategic transactions occur [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1236.08s)]
*  at bringing in the asset at the early stage through a licensing agreement or an acquisition. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1243.52s)]
*  That's the usual way that we do that. And then we develop the program up to a predetermined [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1250.32s)]
*  inflection point. We have no intention of commercializing the drug. So, we don't take [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1258.56s)]
*  the program through to phase three into commercialization. We're not set up for that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1264.32s)]
*  We don't have the expertise for that. The big pharma companies are much better suited to that. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1269.6s)]
*  So, once we have usually human proof of concept somewhere in phase two, then we start looking at [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1276.08s)]
*  either the company being acquired or licensed to a big pharma company or going an IPO, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1282.7199999999998s)]
*  which is what happened with Simcoe, became a completely independent company through an IPO. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1288.24s)]
*  And then as an independent public company did the transaction with AstraZeneca. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1295.12s)]
*  I'd love to take credit for that transaction, but I wasn't involved at all because it was a [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1301.6s)]
*  completely independent public company by that stage. Yeah. Okay. You had mentioned earlier that [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1305.6s)]
*  you're not agnostic. Centorex is not agnostic. So, I want to dig a little bit into the selection [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1312.56s)]
*  criteria. So, recently you've illustrated interest in metabolic disease. So, you've [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1320.48s)]
*  got four early phase mono and combination therapies for the treatment of obesity in the pipeline. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1332.56s)]
*  And not coincidentally, you've built your scientific advisory board with quite a bit of metabolic [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1338.0s)]
*  expertise in recent years or months. So, that's an indicator that there's a hot area for you. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1344.6399999999999s)]
*  When and how, using that maybe as an example, when and how does that become a focus area for [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1354.08s)]
*  Centorex? So, the general focus areas where we have deep expertise within the company [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1361.2s)]
*  is cardiovascular, metabolic and renal disease. That's the main, the core where our expertise lies. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1367.76s)]
*  And it's to some extent, it's common thread flowing through those areas. Metabolic disease [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1376.48s)]
*  leads to cardiovascular disease and renal disease. So, it's different facets of an overall [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1383.68s)]
*  bad Western diet, growing obesity levels that plagues our society. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1391.52s)]
*  And metabolic disease is the kind of linchpin that holds many of these disease areas together [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1402.56s)]
*  and is the initiating pathology that leads on to cardiovascular and eventually renal disease as [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1410.08s)]
*  well. So, it's an area of deep interest for us. Until recently, the treatment of obesity has been [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1417.04s)]
*  very ferocious. They haven't been effective and safe drugs. And that has, of course, in the last [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1426.72s)]
*  several years been completely revolutionized. Yeah, the GLP-1 drugs. Yeah. Was Centorex focused [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1433.04s)]
*  there before this sort of GLP craze took off? There was interest always in obesity and diabetes, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1441.2s)]
*  which is kind of the sister disease of obesity. But once the obesity area, once this great new [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1448.4s)]
*  world where obesity is a disease that can be medically treated very safely and very effectively, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1456.4s)]
*  then it certainly was kicked out in a few notches. Yeah. How do, I guess, waves of innovation in a [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1462.8000000000002s)]
*  disease area affect a company like Centorex in terms of its pipeline and perhaps influencing [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1471.76s)]
*  where you focus? I'm not insinuating that the GLP craze is... I mean, when COVID came about, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1481.2s)]
*  everybody was developing a COVID something for various reasons. Perhaps because there was [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1487.6s)]
*  something to be treated, perhaps because there was a lot of money available to go treat that. So, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1493.6799999999998s)]
*  I guess I'm just wondering in a position like yours where you have a direct influence on [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1497.9199999999998s)]
*  what comes in and what goes out, how much market forces and factors influence you or sway you [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1505.6s)]
*  in different directions. I said earlier that what gets not only me, but most of the people at the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1513.1999999999998s)]
*  company out of bed in the morning is thinking of the patient. And the context of obesity, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1518.7199999999998s)]
*  where this miracle drug or category of drugs is now available, what we try and do is say, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  this is fantastic. We've got a disease area that is now very treatable. What's next? Where can this [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1535.1200000000001s)]
*  area be improved? What are the shortfalls in the current disease, in the current treatment options? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1544.64s)]
*  And where is it going? So, to illustrate with obesity, the GLP-1 drugs are fantastic, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1551.44s)]
*  but they have several problems. One, when you start taking the drug, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1557.2s)]
*  people put the weight right back up. About 60% of the weight comes back in the first year. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  And then often people overshoot where they started off. So, they'll land up if they stop [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1568.88s)]
*  taking the drug in a more obese state than before they started taking the drug. Second issue is [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1573.52s)]
*  tolerability. The drugs have in not everyone, but in a lot of people that have tolerability issues, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1580.88s)]
*  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and some people cannot tolerate those effects. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1587.2s)]
*  Tighten up in the dose, starting on a small dose and working out slowly is one way of dealing with [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1594.48s)]
*  it. But a percentage of people will not be able to tolerate those drugs. And lastly, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1599.68s)]
*  when one loses weight, there's bad weight, which is adipose tissue, which is fat, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1607.68s)]
*  but there's also a muscle and bone mass, which is lost as well. If you're 20 or 30, that's not [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1614.0s)]
*  terrible. But if you're 50 and 60, you're losing muscle mass or lean body mass. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1619.68s)]
*  You're accelerating something that's already happening. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1626.56s)]
*  Exactly. So, that's a problem. So, what we do when we sit around at Scenorex and talk about [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1629.04s)]
*  obesity for the future, the discussion goes, what are the alternative approaches that we can take to [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1636.24s)]
*  obesity? How might obesity treatment, similar to hypertension or cancer treatment, it's not one [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1642.96s)]
*  drug, it's a combination of drugs to manage tolerability issues, how might that evolve? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1649.76s)]
*  How can we look at focusing on weight loss that is predominantly adipose tissue, fat weight loss, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1656.96s)]
*  while preserving lean body mass? And there are various approaches to that. So, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1666.8s)]
*  the patient is the starting point, the science is the pathway, and then we look, we scour the earth [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1675.04s)]
*  looking for approaches that make sense, that could meet those scientific objectives that we've set, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1683.2s)]
*  looking back at the patient of the future and how treatment might be optimized for him or her. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1690.32s)]
*  Can you give us a bit of an update on where Scenorex is in terms of clinical activity right now? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1697.76s)]
*  Sure. On the metabolic front specifically? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1704.8s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. Since we're talking about that, but feel free to discuss any notable clinical activity. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1707.36s)]
*  So, the portfolio company that the metabolic drugs are housed in is called Sinfina, and the four [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1715.12s)]
*  drugs that we have there is two novel mechanisms, the one is called GDF-15 and the other one is PYY. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1721.6s)]
*  The alternative approaches to treating obesity to the GLP-1s, they work in a different way. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1731.12s)]
*  And then we're looking at the possibility of combining those two drugs, each with a GLP-1 [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1739.12s)]
*  analog. The idea behind it being, can you improve tolerability for patients and can you [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1745.6s)]
*  maintain lean body mass while reducing the bad fat, the adipose tissue? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1754.32s)]
*  Yeah. And that's the focus of our ongoing clinical study. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1761.6s)]
*  That's interesting because another question that was swimming around in the back of my mind while [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1765.1999999999998s)]
*  we were talking about GLP-1 and your approach to obesity is sort of the displacement of new [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1768.8799999999999s)]
*  approach. The displacement of old approaches to even non-therapeutic approaches to a specific [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1775.28s)]
*  indication by new indications. For instance, before GLP-1, gastric bypass was the transurgical [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1783.6s)]
*  intervention, which comes with perhaps maybe less risk of losing lean body weight and bone density, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1794.16s)]
*  but similarly, I'm not sure what the word for it is, but when you fall off the wagon, you fall [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1805.12s)]
*  hard, even with gastric bypass. So with new technologies that perhaps address some of those [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1812.48s)]
*  shortcomings, perhaps you can displace the previous approach, the previous standard, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1818.72s)]
*  but you're saying that's not necessarily the approach that CINERACs take? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1825.52s)]
*  Well, indeed it is because one of the drugs that we're working on, the GDF-15, may well, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1828.56s)]
*  and this is something we interrogate in the clinical trials and the development of the [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1837.2s)]
*  clinical trials, could a drug like GDF-15 be the maintenance part of the patient's therapy? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1842.72s)]
*  So the GLP-1s are excellent at dropping weight significantly and quickly, but if the GLP-1s are [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1853.28s)]
*  continuing to cause one to lose lean body mass, that's not a great idea in the very long term. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1860.72s)]
*  So might a drug like GDF-15, which may not have the lean body mass loss, in fact, there are some [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1867.68s)]
*  data that suggests it improves lean body mass. So might that be an appropriate strategy for once [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1874.72s)]
*  a person has lost the weight enough to improve their health outcome significantly, but then [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1881.68s)]
*  doesn't necessarily want to stop and put the weight right back on, but doesn't necessarily [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1888.48s)]
*  want to be on the GLP-1 for the rest of their life either. Might a drug like the GDF-15 be the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1892.5600000000002s)]
*  maintenance therapy part of the equation? Yeah, we should have showed that work. It plays beautifully, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1898.0800000000002s)]
*  it seems, to the adolescence analogy that you gave me earlier, right? Like there should be a [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1906.0800000000002s)]
*  ample opportunity to market that to big buy-out. So it's early days, we understanding how these [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1911.68s)]
*  drugs work and what the effects are on lean body mass and adipose tissue, but it's very exciting [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1920.96s)]
*  because the armamentarium that will be available to treat obesity is just exponential, and many [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1929.9199999999998s)]
*  therapies will be available and would be able to be tailored to exactly what a particular patient [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1941.1200000000001s)]
*  needs. Any other notable clinical progress of late? We have two gastrointestinal companies. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1949.2s)]
*  We're working on a disease area called gastroparesis, which is a disease that can [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1961.3600000000001s)]
*  either be idiopathic, just happens for no apparent reason, or is very commonly associated with [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1966.8s)]
*  patients who have diabetes, and that's a bloating inability of the stomach contents to move, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1973.04s)]
*  causes pain and nausea and vomiting, and can be very debilitating. We're working on a drug [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1981.04s)]
*  that's currently in phase two on that. We have another program that's for irritable bowel syndrome, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1987.9199999999998s)]
*  the diarrheal form. Irritable bowel syndrome is by far the most common reason for referral [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=1996.0s)]
*  to a gastroenterologist. A very high number of people suffer from that, and there's certainly [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2002.96s)]
*  significant improvements that need to be made in the treatments that are available. We have an [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2009.68s)]
*  early stage oncology program, and we also have, as you said, BTB, which is another metabolic [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2016.08s)]
*  company that's an investment that we made. So a number of different areas, and we're constantly [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2024.8s)]
*  looking for new, interesting opportunities. J.P. Morgan is a great place to catch up with [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2030.48s)]
*  people, progress transactions that are in the making. Yeah, when you come into an engagement [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2038.8s)]
*  like J.P. Morgan, or any investor conference for that matter, this being sort of the granddaddy of [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2044.3999999999999s)]
*  them all, but when you personally come into an event like this, again, similar to the challenges [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2048.8s)]
*  that you have as a company who's transacting on both ends of the spectrum, how do you sort of, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2057.44s)]
*  what's your amount, how do you sort of come into this event with a mindset that you've got goals [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2063.44s)]
*  to achieve when, I mean, really, it can move in any number of directions for your company? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2068.5600000000004s)]
*  There's three big things that we're doing all the time. We're looking for new opportunities. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2073.36s)]
*  We're raising money to feed the hungry children through their analytics. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2079.84s)]
*  Someone must have coached you and said, listen, when you go talk to Matt, he likes really simple [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2086.0s)]
*  analogies. That's a good one. That's the way my brain works, very simple analogies. And then, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2089.28s)]
*  you know, the exit, be it an IPO or a strategic transaction with a big pharma company. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2096.4s)]
*  So any one of these partnering conferences, we generally do all three. We meet with potential [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2103.44s)]
*  investors and investments can happen at the top coat area at the sonorex level or investments in [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2109.52s)]
*  the various portfolio companies at the appropriate time and constantly looking for in licensing [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2119.36s)]
*  opportunities and constantly talking to big pharma companies about potential strategic [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2126.6400000000003s)]
*  investments or talking to bankers about IPO. If such things ever come back to us, but [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2133.84s)]
*  always doing those three things at every conference. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2142.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you mentioned IPOs. And from what I understand in late Q4, 23, the M&A market started [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2145.52s)]
*  to pick up again. Inter-trades are coming down. There's a reason for optimism and I'm feeling it. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2155.04s)]
*  It's hard not to feel it at this event. You can come into a bear market and no offense, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2161.04s)]
*  but the chief business officers of the world come in with their best foot forward and smiles on their [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2166.88s)]
*  faces and everything, sunshine and roses. The sense here though is that there are some real [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2171.52s)]
*  indicators that things are turning around. What's your take? I do think that we've turned a corner. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2176.64s)]
*  The last half of 23 was absolutely brutal for all three of those areas that we work in. It was very [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2184.16s)]
*  difficult. There seems to be in addition to the hard indicators that you mentioned, the interest [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2191.84s)]
*  rates and the number of transactions improving, there is an air of optimism and the conversations [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2196.88s)]
*  are a little freer. And at the end of the day, there is money. People have been reluctant and [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2204.88s)]
*  cautious to part with their money in the form of investments, particularly the last half of 23, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2211.2000000000003s)]
*  but can't hold on to money forever. So with interest rates, with the softer and harder [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2217.6s)]
*  indicators of gradual improvement, it feels better even this early on in this year. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2224.24s)]
*  Yeah, sentiment creates inertia. It sounds soft or fluffy to say, well, it feels better, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2231.4399999999996s)]
*  but there is truth to it. Feeling, the sentiment does move the needle. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2241.3599999999997s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2245.68s)]
*  Yeah, excellent. So I often like to ask seasoned veterans of the space to share advice with [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2246.72s)]
*  perhaps first-time founders and leaders of biotechs. I'd like to kind of winnow that question [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2253.84s)]
*  down for you a little bit based on your experiences and your past. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2261.36s)]
*  So if you're speaking to someone who perhaps is coming from the scientific or medical side [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2269.52s)]
*  and has an interest in getting involved in the business side of biotech, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2274.08s)]
*  speaking specifically to that person, what advice would you offer? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2279.04s)]
*  I would say that the transactional side of pharma and biotech is to a large extent an apprentice [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2284.0s)]
*  type education. So while it's very useful to have formal education in the form of an MBA, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2293.44s)]
*  or whatever you decide to do, that definitely is useful. But the only way of really learning it [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2301.12s)]
*  is to sit at the table and observe and gradually increase your participation. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2307.84s)]
*  So find someone who you really respect. And respect in this context, I think, has two [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2313.44s)]
*  components. One, that the person genuinely has the patient as the center of their focus. And [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2320.5600000000004s)]
*  that's for two reasons. One, we're not selling widgets in this industry. We actually have [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2328.7200000000003s)]
*  people's health that they're entrusting to us. And it's a very important and heavy burden to [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2334.08s)]
*  bear that comes with a lot of responsibility. But there's also a good business reason to have [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2342.0s)]
*  the patient at the center. Because if you do that and develop your drugs to specifically [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2347.36s)]
*  help patients, either in terms of their disease burden or the quality of their life, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2354.4s)]
*  the financial reward comes automatically as a part of that. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2362.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you think that gets lost at times? I think it does. Yeah, I think it does. Because particularly, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2369.36s)]
*  you know, in a year like 23, where money is so tight, that the focus drifts away from that to [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2375.92s)]
*  budgets and cutting corners and trying to save money and do things quicker and perhaps [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2384.08s)]
*  cutting a few corners that should not be cut. So yes, I think that the focus is lost when times [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2393.52s)]
*  are tough. And then the other is to find someone who transacts in a collaborative way. And there's [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2399.6s)]
*  two reasons for that. One, the end product, the transaction is a much better transaction for all [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2409.12s)]
*  parties involved. And secondly, it's not a particularly pleasant life to spend your entire [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2417.04s)]
*  work day fighting with people. It's much better. It's much more fun and it's much more pleasurable [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2424.3199999999997s)]
*  to spend your time working together with the party on the other side of the table to find [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2431.3599999999997s)]
*  a truly innovative collaborative solution to a problem rather than just slogging out a compromise. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2438.48s)]
*  The most recent conversation that I had with a chief business officer on this topic on [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2448.64s)]
*  negotiation on transacting was Neela Patel. And it strikes me that she's also an MD, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2454.4s)]
*  not maybe a PhD, but she came from the science side. And you have a similar demeanor. You're both [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2464.48s)]
*  very even keeled. You both come across as very intelligent, but thoughtful. Do you think that's [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2470.64s)]
*  key from a personality standpoint, coming into a position like yours? I think being even killed and [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2478.8799999999997s)]
*  not having an ego is helpful because everything takes so long in drug development. It's a 10, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2487.52s)]
*  15, 20 year process. And if the person is going to get all flustered and rates and [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2500.16s)]
*  needs to throw temper tantrums, it just doesn't work. You have to be able to just [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2509.68s)]
*  take a step back, really turn off your own ego and look at the process, look at the data [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2519.8399999999997s)]
*  in a very critical way, see what makes sense and just work at it. I think of every transaction [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2528.96s)]
*  as having 20 demons to slay. There's 20 problems that are coming your way on every transaction. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2540.16s)]
*  Each one of them could derail the transaction completely. And you have to very systematically [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2547.2s)]
*  and very patiently deal with each one, find a solution and then move on to the next one. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2553.9199999999996s)]
*  And you get to a point, 15 demons in, where you're over the hump. You know that the deal [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2560.0s)]
*  is going to happen, but there's still the last remaining issues that need to be solved. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2566.0s)]
*  Yeah. What haven't I asked you, Dr. Samuels, that I should have, right? If I were a better [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2572.96s)]
*  interviewer, what would I have asked you? What would you have shared? What would I have [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2579.2s)]
*  pried for that you'd like to add to the conversation? I think what I am particularly [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2583.44s)]
*  proud of about Synorex is the model, the notion of having a holding company, the Synorex company, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2589.6s)]
*  with the portfolio company, SIX at present, underneath that. What I like about that is [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2602.56s)]
*  there's tremendous inefficiency in the biotech and pharma space, where a typical small biotech [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2608.16s)]
*  company has a full-time CEO and a full-time CFO and a full-time CMO and CSO and the whole C-suite. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2616.88s)]
*  And they're working on one particular drug. And it always puzzles us what many of these people [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2624.96s)]
*  are doing for eight or 10 hours a day. The Synorex model is different. It's about fractionally [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2633.12s)]
*  providing services to the portfolio company. So one portfolio company may need my full attention [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2641.2s)]
*  this week for five days, 10 hours a day, but next week may not need any of my attention and [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2650.08s)]
*  I can move on to another company. The same with the CEO services that are provided, the same with [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2658.08s)]
*  the medical services and the scientific services. So what I like about the Synorex model is the [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2664.96s)]
*  efficiency because people who work in biotech are generally expensive people. They have many, many [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2672.2400000000002s)]
*  years of education and experience behind them. And if you can efficiently use those resources [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2680.2400000000002s)]
*  across multiple portfolio companies to make sure that every minute of every person's time is being [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2690.08s)]
*  used in an effective and efficient way, I think that's not only good for Synorex, but it's good [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2696.4s)]
*  for drug development because it improves the efficiency and consequently the cost of developing [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2703.12s)]
*  drugs. Yeah, I mean, so theoretically, totally get it. But in practice, it occurs to me that [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2710.08s)]
*  it would take a special person to be a fractional CMO or CSO or CBO for that matter across multiple [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2719.76s)]
*  companies, multiple modalities, multiple indications. So I'm not challenging the notion. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2727.92s)]
*  I'm suggesting that perhaps Synorex has found some unicorns to fill those positions. A lot of [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2734.96s)]
*  folks come at it like, well, I'm an antibiotic. I can transact all day long in the world of [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2740.88s)]
*  monoclonal antibodies. So tell me a little bit about that. I don't think it's as rare as unicorns, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2746.72s)]
*  but I don't think it's for everyone either. It's somewhere between this. There's a particular [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2752.24s)]
*  personality at Synorex. One anecdote, every one of us will be on a conference call two minutes early. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a thing. You were in my makeshift recording booth before I was, so you proved that. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2767.7599999999998s)]
*  So that's a little anecdote, but every single person is one or two minutes early to every single [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2775.76s)]
*  meeting. We all are very passionate people. We want to make a difference and we all enjoy [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2782.88s)]
*  tremendous diversity. We get bored doing the same thing every day. So those are some of the [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2792.6400000000003s)]
*  characteristics that a person needs. Again, not a unicorn, but certainly not for everyone either. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2798.8s)]
*  So, Tate, no. Well, awesome. I appreciate this. You've been a joy to talk with. It's been a very [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2806.32s)]
*  insightful conversation. I'm glad you made some time for me. I know it's a very busy week, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2812.88s)]
*  so I'm honored that you took some time to spend with the Business of Biotech. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj5j-m7S_8E&t=2817.76s)]
