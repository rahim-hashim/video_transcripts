Video Description: As if Orna Therapeutics' CEO, Thomas Barnes, isn't enough to draw you in to the Business of Biotech, we teamed up with Advancing RNA Editorial & Community Director Anna Rose Welch to co-host this week's episode. Together, Anna Rose and I press Dr. Barnes on his transition from academia to biotech, the therapeutic proposition of circular, or "O", RNA and why it holds great potential to best linear RNA constructs, the novel, platform- and partnership-based approaches Orna is taking to address B-cell lymphomas and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, viral vector and lipid nanoparticle complexity, and a whole lot more.

# Circular RNA with Orna Therapeutics' Tom Barnes, Ph.D. and Advancing RNA's Anna Rose Welch
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [April 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo)
*  I'm Matt Piller, host of the Business of Biotech podcast, and if you're listening to my voice right now but not seeing my face, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=0.0s)]
*  maybe you haven't heard that we've launched a new Business of Biotech video cast page under the Listen and Watch tab at bioprocessonline.com. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=6.48s)]
*  There, you'll find hundreds of videos of my interviews with biotech builders, categorized by topic like finance and capital markets, regulatory, discovery, and manufacturing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Don't try it if you listen while driving, but be sure to check it out when you get where you're going. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=26.4s)]
*  Go to bioprocessonline.com, hit the Listen and Watch tab, and choose Business of Biotech in the drop down. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=31.2s)]
*  Welcome back to the Business of Biotech. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=41.2s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller, and it's a special day here in the studio because we're going to be talking in circles, circular RNA that is, with Orna Therapeutics CEO, Dr. Thomas Barnes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=42.68s)]
*  And if you're watching, you can see that as such, I've brought along with me my dear friend and colleague, Anna Rose Welch, who is editorial and community director for our relatively new, advancing RNA community at LifeScience Connect. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=53.6s)]
*  Welcome, Anna Rose. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=68.76s)]
*  Thank you, Matt. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=69.92s)]
*  Awesome to have you here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=70.84s)]
*  It's awesome to be here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=72.04s)]
*  We're uncomfortably close right now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=73.28s)]
*  We share a wall, and now we share a wall. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=75.64s)]
*  Now we share nothing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=77.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=78.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=78.76s)]
*  Collectively, Dr. Barnes and Anna Rose have likely forgotten much more about RNA than I ever knew or ever will know, so you're in good hands today if you're into RNA. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=80.16s)]
*  For its part, ORNA, that is, is developing circular RNA therapeutics delivered via lipid nanoparticles to treat indications, including B-cell lymphomas and DMD, in addition to some discovery stage vaccine and other therapeutic programs. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Dr. Barnes, who's been at the helm there since 2020, previously co-founded or led a number of biotechs, including Intelia and 11 Therapeutics. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=107.12s)]
*  It also serves as an executive partner at the investment firm MPM BioImpact. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Barnes, welcome. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=123.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=125.2s)]
*  Pleasure to be here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  It's our pleasure to have you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  And I want to start out by getting to know you a little bit before we kind of dig into the company and where you guys are going with your therapeutics. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=129.68s)]
*  Your academic experience in genomics stands for itself. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=136.76s)]
*  You've got a Cambridge PhD, a Harvard postdoc, a McGill fellowship. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=140.72s)]
*  Rewind the clock quite a bit and tell us why and I guess when and why you decided to take that academic experience into industry. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=147.12s)]
*  Well, the story actually begins when I finished my undergraduate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=156.2s)]
*  So my undergraduate in the University of Sydney was majoring in genetics with a minor in biochemistry. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=161.4s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  What I realized coming out and the Australian program is for a basic bachelor's degree, it's a three year program. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=169.72s)]
*  And the fourth year is optional, which you spend in the lab if you want to do that extra thing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=175.76s)]
*  So I was very interested in doing that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=179.96s)]
*  But in coming out of that, I was pretty sure I didn't want to be an academic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  That point in time represented the end of all the fog and momentum from high school. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=190.88s)]
*  When you go into university and you know, it's all on a track. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=195.32s)]
*  And then it's like now what? Yes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  So I could go do a PhD at that point, but that I wasn't sure that that's what I wanted to do. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=200.24s)]
*  That was the direction I want to go in academia. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=206.16s)]
*  So I actually took a year off doing a variety of odd jobs, in fact, ranging from working in a department store to being a taxi driver. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=208.64s)]
*  And in the end, there was a biotech company that was starting in Sydney, Australia, just like they have in America. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=216.4s)]
*  This was a long time ago. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=225.36s)]
*  So it was in the early days. This is in the 80s, early 80s. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=227.72000000000003s)]
*  And so I thought, well, that could be interesting. Let's try that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=231.24s)]
*  So I got a job there. And very shortly after joining that, I was like, oh, yes, this, this I understand. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=234.08s)]
*  This I get. I love this. I don't like academia. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=240.8s)]
*  And what is the this that I was liking? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=244.36s)]
*  The this is the teamwork, the fact that everybody across the whole company is pulling together at the same direction [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=246.24s)]
*  and that the pace at which things move are not limited by your own clumsy fingers, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  but that ultimately it's everybody's hands working together, pulls things forward at an incredible pace. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=260.16s)]
*  So it's much more stimulating and there's a much stronger sense of camaraderie across the whole organization. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=264.12s)]
*  Whereas in academic labs, you have these fiefdoms, you know, my lab, you get your stuff off my freezer shelf kind of mentality. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=268.24s)]
*  And so that sort of team sport aspect of science was instantly appealing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=276.6s)]
*  So I was there actually for four years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=281.8s)]
*  What was your what was your role there? That that initial first blush with industry? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=283.64s)]
*  What was what was the role when you started? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=287.12s)]
*  Well, I was a research assistant and I promoted to a senior research assistant at one point. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=288.8s)]
*  But it was back in the cloning days where, you know, you know, you would clone a gene and that was exciting. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=294.24s)]
*  And that would be a big paper. It would be a big event. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  So that's what we were doing, cloning and expressing proteins in E. Coli. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=303.92s)]
*  That's what the world was doing back then. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=309.84s)]
*  So at one point, I thought, all right, maybe I want to do more than this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=312.88s)]
*  You know, what what would that be? I considered various. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=318.88s)]
*  I'm doing this sort of career thing here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=322.2s)]
*  I don't have to be going on quite so much about it, but that's maybe it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=324.76s)]
*  Please do. Yeah, it's good. It's good. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=328.08s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's a frame of reference. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=330.08s)]
*  Well, we'll fast forward if we need to. OK. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=332.36s)]
*  We. So I was thought, well, maybe I should do go to patent law because there are very few people who had a science and patent law background. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=335.4s)]
*  But in the end, I got some advice, which is some of the best advice I ever received in my life, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  which is always pick the option that leaves most options open. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=349.96s)]
*  I've used that piece of advice many times, and so I realized that the answer to the puzzle then was go get a PhD, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  because I can still do everything I was contemplating on doing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=361.12s)]
*  That was one of the things I was going to. So I should go get that because it's also a terminal degree. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=364.0s)]
*  There's nothing more after that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  So then I launched off to do my my PhD and then a postdoc at Harvard. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=369.67999999999995s)]
*  But the you know, the plan was to go back to biotech. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=376.76s)]
*  I was I was originally I when I left, I was going to go back to Sydney. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=381.88s)]
*  But then I kind of got stuck ultimately in the Boston area, which is well now there's something up and coming. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=385.24s)]
*  But now it's the epicenter of biotech in the world. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=390.36s)]
*  And so basically I got stuck like a fly to fly paper. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=392.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. We'll talk about some of the stops along the way, I think, throughout the conversation. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=397.36s)]
*  But I'm going to hit the fast forward button real quick here for a minute, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=403.92s)]
*  because you know, you've had exposure to a lot of different modalities, a lot of different areas of biotech. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=407.4s)]
*  What was it that turned your interest toward RNA? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=412.2s)]
*  Well, it was basically that every time I change jobs, I like to do something different. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=417.24s)]
*  And the opportunity came up to join Intelia. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=423.76s)]
*  I was working with Nessan Birmingham, the original CEO of Intelia on another project. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=429.76000000000005s)]
*  This is associated with Atlas Venture when the possibility of getting Intelia going came up. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=435.16s)]
*  And that was just a very appealing, you know, editing was very new. It was very cool. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  And so it still is. It still is. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=445.44000000000005s)]
*  He was it was I would say it was so cool. It was white hot back then. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=449.36s)]
*  So I had the opportunity to join a CSO, which I did. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=456.32s)]
*  But interestingly, everyone in that space was thinking about doing cell therapy, ex vivo manipulated cells, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  because that was that was technologically tractable or doing some sort of viral delivery editing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=465.76s)]
*  And so you had CRISPR therapeutics to pick the first one and an edit us was an exemplar of the second one. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=473.0s)]
*  Now, we certainly had at Intelia, we had an alliance with Novartis on the cell therapy, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  but we also were trying something a bit kooky, which is to try and do RNA delivery through a lipid nanoparticle [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=483.4s)]
*  where the the editor was encoded in a messenger RNA. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=490.12s)]
*  The guide RNA was also in the mix and they would all get sorted out once they got into a cell. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=494.35999999999996s)]
*  One would get expressed. The protein would find the short RNA. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=499.76s)]
*  The two of them are trying to off to the nucleus, cut some DNA and do some damage, literally. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=502.96s)]
*  And so that seemed science fictiony, but we thought we'd give it a shot. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=509.2s)]
*  And again, now I'll press fast forward. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=514.84s)]
*  We got it to work some years later. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=517.72s)]
*  And I think to I think ultimately when the first clinical results came out in the summer of twenty one, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=519.88s)]
*  it was obviously it was international front page news, editing in Vivo for the first time. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=527.8s)]
*  And we were the ones who showed that such a thing as possible. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=533.0s)]
*  Now, of course, everybody thinks, well, of course, you want to do editing that way. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=536.04s)]
*  All the other ways are so fiddly. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=539.12s)]
*  But before we started, it was it was science fiction. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=541.28s)]
*  So I wasn't drawn to RNA so much as I fell into it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=545.04s)]
*  Yeah. I'm curious about that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=549.0s)]
*  Like the science fiction white hot, you know, cutting edge, brand new kind of attraction. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=550.96s)]
*  What is it about Tom Barnes that makes him like what's the opposite of of a verse like embrace? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=559.08s)]
*  What is it about you that that that makes you want to? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=567.36s)]
*  Yeah. Draw to like how it takes a special person to embrace something that is so. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, more dramatic than nascent, right, and make a career of it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, you could I guess my point is you could have risky business. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=582.2800000000001s)]
*  Sure. Like you could have you could have done a bang up job in, you know, antibodies, for instance. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=585.36s)]
*  But no, you chose to go do some cutting edge gene editing and get into the RNA space. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=591.5200000000001s)]
*  What is it about your makeup that makes you embrace that? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=596.88s)]
*  Well, I'm a person firstly, and I understand biotech. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=600.04s)]
*  In other words, I don't in my mind require each attempt to be. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=604.64s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a home run. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=613.08s)]
*  I understand that, you know, we'll give this a go. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=614.48s)]
*  And if not, you know, if there's if what I call a noble failure ultimately, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=616.68s)]
*  then, you know, that you can pick up and do something else. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=621.48s)]
*  At least that's my approach. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=625.44s)]
*  So that's one reason why I'm so tolerant to that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=626.28s)]
*  But the other thing is, you know, I'm very curious. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=628.56s)]
*  I'm interested in a lot of things. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=630.68s)]
*  And so I do. I think it's a bit of my makeup to maybe I'm a sort of a science hipster. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=632.48s)]
*  I kind of go off the mainstream and I like going counter culturally cross current or something. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=638.8s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, that's that's interesting. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=646.12s)]
*  And, you know, that feeds like some of the questions I have around how you establish a business [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=649.68s)]
*  here in this space when you have sort of a counterculture approach, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=654.92s)]
*  like what perhaps difficulties that might create for you before we get to that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=659.72s)]
*  Tell us the Genesis story of one. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=664.36s)]
*  By the way, in a row, it's really nice to have you here because when I can't think of a word in a row, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=666.8s)]
*  there's a here I'll be a thesaurus. She's a trained poet. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=670.92s)]
*  She's so she's she's very wordy. Yeah. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=673.88s)]
*  And you're like a living sometimes wordy is not great, though. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=676.36s)]
*  A living, breathing thesaurus sitting next to me in the studio. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=679.32s)]
*  Yeah. So tell us tell us our next founding story. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=683.68s)]
*  What what got things started there? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=685.8s)]
*  Yeah. So Orner Orner has a very traditional start in the sense of if you go back to how biotech companies used to go. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=687.28s)]
*  So it used to be that academics would discover something [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  and they would start a company and pull some sort of nascent team together and then try and get venture interested. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=701.52s)]
*  Now, these days, venture typically goes and scours science directly from universities [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=707.2399999999999s)]
*  and selling and builds the company to their own sort of preconception. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=712.32s)]
*  But all it was really in that old mold. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  So our story goes back to 2016 or 2017. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=717.72s)]
*  Dan Anderson of MIT is listening to a talk on circuit naturally occurring so RNA in China and goes, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=722.6s)]
*  Oh, I wonder if that could be an interesting variant on a theme. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=728.5200000000001s)]
*  Of course, Moderna already exists at that time. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=733.84s)]
*  Eleven was coming through and it has already been known for attempting, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=736.0s)]
*  at least the RNA based editing. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=740.64s)]
*  And Dan had a long history in LNPs and RNA in any case. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=743.92s)]
*  And so he gave the task to a graduate student, Alex Wesselhoff, who completely blew it out of the water. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=748.0s)]
*  VHD finished in three and a half years, you know, green thumbs at the bench and solved the fundamental problem, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=756.36s)]
*  which is how can you make circles efficiently at scale and large enough to be useful [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=763.0s)]
*  and figure out how to make them useful by getting them to express things. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=768.76s)]
*  So he did all that. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=772.84s)]
*  And so that was the basis of IP that was filed. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=774.28s)]
*  And then they thought, well, this should be some value here. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=777.8s)]
*  And so the company, a company was formed, it wasn't called Orna at the time. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=781.64s)]
*  And they basically encountered NPM Capital, now NPM Biopact. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=786.4s)]
*  And this is in 2019. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=793.2s)]
*  So the first funding came in in mid 2019. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=795.92s)]
*  But part of that funding was a conception that what this company should do with its circles is to see if it could figure out a way of doing an in vivo thing, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=798.2s)]
*  but not editing in this time, because RNA is going to be transient. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=809.2s)]
*  But can we get the RNA into immune cells? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=812.48s)]
*  And if we could, could we disrupt or displace CAR-Ts and cell therapy completely because it would be so much more convenient. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  So in other words, there's a very high science concept that predates me. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=823.0s)]
*  And it's really an idea that came from NPM. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=827.7199999999999s)]
*  And so money came in and they started building the team immediately with Alex on board. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=829.9599999999999s)]
*  And I started talking to NPM. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=837.5999999999999s)]
*  I had left Intelli earlier 2019. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=839.04s)]
*  I was scouting about things to do. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=841.52s)]
*  And I started talking to them in October or so. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=843.88s)]
*  And we kind of sealed the deal in December. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=846.28s)]
*  So I started early 2020. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=848.76s)]
*  And you had no idea that the world was about to blow up and become all RNA all the time. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=851.7199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=856.8s)]
*  No, I was fated. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=857.52s)]
*  I like to think I had a crystal ball, but I did not. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=859.04s)]
*  Nobody did. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=862.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=863.68s)]
*  It is all RNA all the time. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=864.9599999999999s)]
*  And it's like, and how many how many letters now precede RNA across the spectrum? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=867.3599999999999s)]
*  Quite a few. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=873.28s)]
*  There's quite a few. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=874.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=874.92s)]
*  Letters, shapes. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  Coding, non-coding. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=876.4399999999999s)]
*  That's one of the things I think that's cute about the term we invented for what we do. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  There's something that I noticed early on is that up until that time, certainly in the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=884.12s)]
*  papers that Alex and Dan had published and in the early materials, it was called CirCRNA [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=888.4s)]
*  because CIRC, lowercase, because that's what it's called. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=893.12s)]
*  That's the standard abbreviation. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=896.76s)]
*  But I realized almost immediately people get confused. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=898.6s)]
*  They look up CirCRNA and there's thousands of papers. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=900.8s)]
*  There's a lot of papers on CirCRNA, but none of that is relevant to what we're doing because [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=903.04s)]
*  ours is completely synthetic. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=907.5600000000001s)]
*  We're not extracting CirCRNA cells. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=909.36s)]
*  We're making it in vitro designed to exactly encode exactly what we want. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=912.0s)]
*  And it's made in a different way than it's made in Viva. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=917.16s)]
*  It just in the end looks like a circle. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=919.72s)]
*  So we need a branding for what this is. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=921.48s)]
*  And I remember being at a bar one Friday as one is. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=924.16s)]
*  That's where all the great ideas come from. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=929.04s)]
*  I was thinking of a name of the company as well. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=930.6s)]
*  Actually, really, that's what I was trying to do. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=933.24s)]
*  And I thought, you know, Moderna is kind of cute because it's like mode RNA and they [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=934.6s)]
*  are abbreviated mRNA. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=938.52s)]
*  And I thought we need something. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=941.2s)]
*  What could be RNA? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=942.24s)]
*  Is there an RNA something we could call the company? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=943.52s)]
*  And I thought, well, I don't know. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=945.84s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=950.24s)]
*  I thought, oh, that's cute because then we could call it also ORNA where the O just means [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=953.32s)]
*  circular. It doesn't stand for an O word. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=957.2s)]
*  It just means circular. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=959.2s)]
*  And so that was just born in a flash there. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=960.52s)]
*  And so the important question is what were you drinking at the time? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=963.2s)]
*  I think it was probably a beer. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=967.4s)]
*  So that's that was the that's when the name came in. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=972.8s)]
*  So that was in that was shortly after I started there. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=977.72s)]
*  I'm going to ask both of you guys to unpack for me a little bit the advantages differences [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=982.76s)]
*  between circular RNA, O RNA and specifically in Orna's case, synthetically produced O RNA [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=987.68s)]
*  from and we could go long in this conversation. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=995.52s)]
*  I don't want to go too long. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=997.8s)]
*  This is the business of biotech. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=998.6s)]
*  It's not the science of biotech. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=999.72s)]
*  But for our listeners benefit, maybe just more color on where O RNA fits in the landscape, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1001.4s)]
*  the landscape that we've seen linear RNA for quite some time. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1008.28s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the thing that intrigued Dan back in the day was that even to this day, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1012.3199999999999s)]
*  people don't really know what naturally occurring circles do. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1019.12s)]
*  There's a number of theories, but to my instinct, I don't think any of the theories [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1021.6s)]
*  have really nailed what they're there for. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1026.4s)]
*  They don't doesn't quite feel right. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1028.28s)]
*  But the one thing that people know is that naturally occurring circular RNAs hang out [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1030.64s)]
*  in cells a lot longer than the linear RNA counterparts, particularly even especially [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1034.76s)]
*  if it's derived from the same gene. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1039.3600000000001s)]
*  A circular piece is more long lived than the linear piece. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1040.64s)]
*  So circles live longer than lines. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1043.92s)]
*  And so that was really what Dan said. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1046.72s)]
*  Well, if you could do a whole technology based on circles, you'd have to be better. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1048.44s)]
*  You know, half life is better. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1052.64s)]
*  And that's so we've gone on to show that that's true. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1054.48s)]
*  And I think it's been shown now in multiple people's hands. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1057.0800000000002s)]
*  But what we discovered along the way is that circular RNA, I call it the gift that keeps [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1060.64s)]
*  on giving because it continued to show these unexpected advantages of mRNA. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1065.68s)]
*  And the way I would summarize it again, coming back maybe to the business, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1072.64s)]
*  unless on the sides, is that if. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1075.8799999999999s)]
*  If the world could make circular RNA the way we make circular RNA for products, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1080.24s)]
*  nobody would make linear RNA products anymore [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1087.4399999999998s)]
*  because circles have advantage upon advantage over lines and no disadvantages. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  There's no trade off. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1098.9599999999998s)]
*  There's basically fewer, better, more bits and pieces in to get a circle to work than [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1100.8s)]
*  there is for a line. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1107.36s)]
*  So it's just it's funny because of course, the mRNA is that is our RNA. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  It's how instructions are coded. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1113.2s)]
*  So naturally, we try and mimic that in the product and no one knows what circles do. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1114.32s)]
*  But as a biotechnology, as a product, the correct answer is circles. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1117.6s)]
*  It's not the way we do it, but the correct version of a product should be a circle [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1122.24s)]
*  because it's more stable. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1126.8s)]
*  It's easier to make. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  It's far cheaper to make. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1129.6s)]
*  It's made of high yield. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1130.8s)]
*  You can make them much larger. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1132.08s)]
*  You can express them much higher. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  They hang out in cells much longer and they package much more efficiently in the lipid [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1135.4399999999998s)]
*  nanoparticle at the end of the day. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1139.4399999999998s)]
*  So they're just better in every way. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1142.32s)]
*  HOFFMAN Yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1145.6799999999998s)]
*  What's the take on the market right now in terms of other companies that are looking [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1147.9199999999998s)]
*  to develop and capitalize on circular RNA? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1152.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, are you one of a few, one of many? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1155.1999999999998s)]
*  HADDAD You can make them honest on this, Ann. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1157.28s)]
*  Or you cover this space. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1161.84s)]
*  You follow this space. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1162.8s)]
*  There's no one else like it. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1163.6s)]
*  AMANDA It's getting hotter and hotter. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1165.44s)]
*  HOFFMAN It's getting hotter and hotter. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1166.8799999999999s)]
*  I think, you know, we were first out there with these claims and then I think many people [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1169.44s)]
*  come along and corroborate the claims, I think, to their own satisfaction. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1173.68s)]
*  So I think we've got to get in on this action. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1178.32s)]
*  But the thing is, though, that there's, as far as I'm aware, there's only one way of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1180.6399999999999s)]
*  making circles efficiently. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1184.72s)]
*  And that's the way that Alex discovered in Dan's lab. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1186.32s)]
*  And we have an exclusive license to that. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1189.84s)]
*  So now having said that, there's more than one way to make a circle. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1194.0s)]
*  You can make it inefficiently if you wish. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1197.12s)]
*  And if you, in the end, had a, you know, one gram of circle made this way and one gram [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1198.48s)]
*  made that way, it's still a gram of circle. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  At that point, then it's what does it encode? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1205.04s)]
*  What are the other differences in the molecule? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1206.96s)]
*  But, you know, in terms of ease and efficiency, I would say, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1209.4399999999998s)]
*  ours is made in one step to be clear. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1212.88s)]
*  There's no capping, there's no tailing. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1215.92s)]
*  There's a single enzyme, which is the polymerase. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1218.5600000000002s)]
*  There's no capping enzyme or tailing enzyme. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  So there's no mods. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1223.0400000000002s)]
*  We don't need mods because circles purify more readily from the contaminants in the [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1225.1200000000001s)]
*  in vitro transcription reaction for which you need the mods. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1232.24s)]
*  So if you don't have the mods as contaminants, then you don't need the mods at all. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  And mods are much more expensive than regular nucleotides. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1239.1200000000001s)]
*  So our cost to make a gram of finished stuff is like one tenth to one fifteenth of mRNA. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1241.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're so real. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1247.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's some really nice supply chain benefits to working with circular RNA. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1249.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think, too, you know, just the field talks a lot about the clinical benefits as [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1253.12s)]
*  well, or, you know, the hopes for clinical benefits in the future, right, in terms of [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1257.76s)]
*  overcoming some of this, just the stability, the durability limitations that we've seen [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1262.32s)]
*  with linear mRNA. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1266.56s)]
*  So I've been watching it really, I've been watching it with a lot of anticipation to [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1267.84s)]
*  see where it goes, because I have been watching sort of the numbers of pipeline products, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1273.4399999999998s)]
*  right, start to creep up in the circular RNA space. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1279.76s)]
*  It's getting some more respect and some more attention. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  And I really liked what you were saying earlier, too, because it's, you know, you were talking [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1285.9199999999998s)]
*  about it, sort of the iterative innovation, right, that the entire space is sort of going [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1289.76s)]
*  through and how you approach failure and the challenge of working in a potential area that [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1296.32s)]
*  still has yet to really find its future, right? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1302.48s)]
*  I think the RNA space as a whole, particularly on the encoding side, right, your mRNAs, your [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1304.8s)]
*  self-amplifying your circular, still have a long ways to go, right, I think in terms of [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1310.72s)]
*  efficiency of development and their biological impacts, right? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1316.32s)]
*  So I'm really curious to kind of pick your brain on how heading up in a circular RNA [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1320.96s)]
*  company is challenging today, right, especially since we are still trying to figure out, I always [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1327.8400000000001s)]
*  kind of call it the mRNA identity proposition, right, within the advanced therapy space, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1334.72s)]
*  within the biologic sector. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1340.16s)]
*  How do you, you know, how are you navigating some of the risks of working with a very novel [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1342.32s)]
*  technology today and how does that impact your leadership strategy, right, of a company that's [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1347.04s)]
*  kind of been paving the pathway for this modality? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1353.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the risks we embraced are substantially more than the ones we've been [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1357.92s)]
*  talking about, because, as I mentioned, the first thing we were meant to do was go find [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1363.44s)]
*  away a lipid, a particle, which would naturally deliver to immune cells. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1368.72s)]
*  Such a thing did not exist. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1372.32s)]
*  Such a thing was never suggested to have even been possible. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1374.48s)]
*  Everyone kind of thinks these things go to the liver as a default. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1377.28s)]
*  So not only were we trying to develop circles as a novel payload and promulgate the idea that [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1380.16s)]
*  they don't need mods, which is iconic, classic. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1387.44s)]
*  In fact, you know, a Nobel Prize has been given on the need for mods and there we are saying, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1389.44s)]
*  well, you don't actually need them if you use circles. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1394.8s)]
*  I'm not saying it wasn't a great idea, you know, I myself have received linear RNA vaccines, but [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1397.52s)]
*  it's an interesting point, technology bowls. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1403.68s)]
*  But we're trying to do this thing with delivery as well. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1405.92s)]
*  We were doing two things. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1409.1200000000001s)]
*  So, you know, my feeling was, yeah, this is not going to work. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1410.88s)]
*  I love the honesty. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1417.92s)]
*  So how do you do that? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1420.56s)]
*  Basically, it's exciting what you're trying to do. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1421.3600000000001s)]
*  The vision is there. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1423.76s)]
*  And some people are always drawn to that, to that exciting possibility. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1425.6000000000001s)]
*  They risk time, I guess, like I am. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1428.96s)]
*  That's always true at the early stages of a startup. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1430.4s)]
*  I mean, NPM was a very good, a very solid name in terms of the venture [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1432.48s)]
*  backings. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1436.48s)]
*  There was good funds available. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1436.88s)]
*  But, you know, you also have to have a backup plan. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1438.96s)]
*  Okay, what do you do if this doesn't, if this doesn't work out? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1441.28s)]
*  And so we had all that. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1445.2s)]
*  But in the end, you know, we actually got it to work. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1446.56s)]
*  And so that was an amazing day, you know, that we could deliver to immune cells and [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1450.56s)]
*  they would take up the circles. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1455.84s)]
*  The circles would express, they produce a car protein on the surface of [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1457.52s)]
*  T's and NK's and macrophages. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1461.68s)]
*  And then those cells would go and attack other cells in the animal, just like a car T does. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1464.0s)]
*  So that was pretty, pretty amazing. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1472.3200000000002s)]
*  And, you know, we showed that. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1474.64s)]
*  So we, you know, innovations were not only academically that we showed how to make. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1476.0800000000002s)]
*  This is a broader way, of course, this is Dan's lab. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1481.2s)]
*  But, you know, Orna and its origin story, you know, showed how to make circles that [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  was possible. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1488.88s)]
*  We showed how to express from circles. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1489.68s)]
*  We showed that it was possible to find an immunotropic lipid. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1491.6000000000001s)]
*  We showed the value proposition behind doing that and what you would do to get that to [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1494.4s)]
*  work. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1498.16s)]
*  So we have blazed a whole series of trails as we've pushed into this. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1498.72s)]
*  And, you know, one of the challenges, obviously, when you start out is also that [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1505.52s)]
*  it's very hard to be noticed. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1511.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1512.72s)]
*  And it's good companies being started all the time. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1513.2s)]
*  And when I was at Intellia, it was a luxury because you'll notice editing, you know, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1516.32s)]
*  everyone would notice every single thing you would do. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1524.6399999999999s)]
*  People lining up around the block to join the company. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1527.52s)]
*  It's like you could pick and choose whoever you want to come. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1530.08s)]
*  It was that intense. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1532.8799999999999s)]
*  And RNA was still very, you know, it was very hot at the time as, you know, the pandemic [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1534.9599999999998s)]
*  had started and there was something with the vaccines. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1542.0s)]
*  But you still, you know, you try and be noticed. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1545.1200000000001s)]
*  And one of the things that was surprising that I still don't really understand to this [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1548.88s)]
*  day is that the idea that the RNA could be circular seemed to capture the imagination [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1551.44s)]
*  of reporters or people who like to write about it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1557.44s)]
*  But it wasn't like, oh, we've got a different cap structure or we do mods a different way [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1560.48s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1565.0400000000002s)]
*  So the RNA circular just seemed intriguing enough that we got noticed early enough. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1565.76s)]
*  And because we were sort of the first one out there, and because it's right there in [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1573.92s)]
*  the name, we kind of became, I don't want to say synonymous, but we certainly became [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1578.0800000000002s)]
*  like the name in the space. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1583.28s)]
*  So it's a little bit of luck being hot, a little bit of sort of marketing. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1585.52s)]
*  But there was also that inexplicable. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1590.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know why circles capture the imagination, but they just do. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1592.3200000000002s)]
*  They're so poetic. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1595.6000000000001s)]
*  And you're ornicorns. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1599.52s)]
*  I mean, come on, you know, it's the myth is just [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1600.8000000000002s)]
*  baked into your company. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1603.68s)]
*  You talked about being first on the scene. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1608.0800000000002s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1610.5600000000002s)]
*  I was just thinking about an episode that dropped a few weeks ago, an episode of the [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1611.1200000000001s)]
*  business of biotech that I named the innovator's dilemma. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1614.16s)]
*  It was with a friend of mine, Brian Finrow at Lumen Biosciences. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1616.64s)]
*  And we talked about that concept of being first on the scene with a new technology or [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1620.16s)]
*  a new approach and how it creates awareness potentially inherently, right? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1624.3200000000002s)]
*  It's something new, but it can also create [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1629.3600000000001s)]
*  tension. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1633.2s)]
*  It can create challenges around getting people to spend money on you. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1634.32s)]
*  You've mentioned NPM a few times. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1638.8s)]
*  It's fantastic to have a good strong partner there. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1640.32s)]
*  But I guess take us behind the scenes a little bit around when you're revealing something [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1642.72s)]
*  new to the community, not just the scientific community, but the investment community. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1648.72s)]
*  What goes into ensuring that you're winning the funding you're going to need to move forward [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1653.2s)]
*  and hit milestones? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1659.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think it has to be the logic of the idea. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1660.8000000000002s)]
*  I might even say the logical ineluctability of the idea. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1667.44s)]
*  The premise here was that cell therapy is fantastic from an efficacy perspective, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1673.6000000000001s)]
*  but it's so cumbersome, so difficult, so challenging for patients. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1680.0s)]
*  They have to be managed so intensively that there's the cost of the therapy. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1683.44s)]
*  Then there's the adjunct costs of just administering and managing the patient [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1686.8s)]
*  during the administration of the therapy and the risk associated with that. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1690.24s)]
*  The idea was, well, if you could just do the manufacturing inside the patient, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1694.72s)]
*  not at the bedside, actually just in the patient, that would make everything go away. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1700.72s)]
*  That's self-evidently true. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1705.84s)]
*  The idea that if only you could, then that would be great. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1708.1599999999999s)]
*  That's an easy sell because that's obviously true. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1712.24s)]
*  The question is, well, how the heck do you do that? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1715.04s)]
*  At least our attempt, which in some ways didn't have to work, but it was a shot on goal. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1718.08s)]
*  There was no name for it, we're trying to do. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1724.3999999999999s)]
*  Now the field is called in vivo car or in vivo CAR T. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1725.84s)]
*  There are some groups that are trying to do it through adapted viruses, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1730.24s)]
*  where the viruses will deliver, will do the job of delivering. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1734.3999999999999s)]
*  Now, of course, they tend to then integrate into the genome. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1737.44s)]
*  Some viruses don't, but like lentivirus vectors will integrate. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1741.04s)]
*  And ours is transient, but it's redosable, which a lentivirus is not. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1745.68s)]
*  When you get to that point of showing that it works, the value proposition is self-evident. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1754.8s)]
*  It's like, if only you could do this, like teleportation. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1763.6s)]
*  Yeah, that could be useful. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1766.32s)]
*  Can you do it? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1768.48s)]
*  It's like you do a little demo. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1769.84s)]
*  I don't have to explain what you would do with teleportation. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1771.04s)]
*  You can take, your mind can take it from there. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1773.28s)]
*  So I just have to show you, look, particle, animal, boom, cells gone, tumor gone. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1775.52s)]
*  People go, I like. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1781.92s)]
*  Here's money. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1784.72s)]
*  Here's money. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1787.2s)]
*  We really picked the wrong career. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1790.24s)]
*  I feel like I picked the wrong question. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1792.6399999999999s)]
*  Dr. Barnes's answer was like, well, because it works, dummy. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1794.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1799.28s)]
*  You're millions of dollars. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1800.48s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1802.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting too. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1804.56s)]
*  Sometimes I have a hard time, my mind, I'm a slow Pennsylvania boy, right? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1806.32s)]
*  My mind doesn't keep up. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1811.36s)]
*  You mentioned earlier the prospect of sort of leapfrogging CAR-T. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1814.08s)]
*  To me, that's kind of mind blowing. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1820.56s)]
*  Like CAR-T is still new. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1822.16s)]
*  And if you talk to CAR-T people, they're telling you like, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1824.96s)]
*  oh, we haven't yet scratched the surface of the indications that we can tackle. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1827.6s)]
*  We're making great progress and solid tumors and so on and so forth. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1832.48s)]
*  So I'm curious about your perspective of how the CAR-T community might, I guess, receive Orna's news. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1837.04s)]
*  And Orna thinks it can kind of leapfrog CAR-T. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1846.8s)]
*  Specifically, how would Dr. Carl June feel about the process? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1849.76s)]
*  Our series A was interesting because every new investor, we had venture investors up until that [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1855.28s)]
*  point, but every new investor we had in the series A was a pharmaceutical company that was doing cell [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1862.32s)]
*  therapy. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1868.1599999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1869.52s)]
*  So in other words, they were saying, we too see the value proposition and we wish to be close to [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1870.56s)]
*  this story in case it works out. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1877.36s)]
*  So I would say embracing the potential. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1881.3600000000001s)]
*  And obviously, in some ways, it's a competitive technology to CAR-T. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1886.96s)]
*  And it's much more pharmaceutical in a way, whereas CAR-T is a living drug. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1894.32s)]
*  It will expand. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1898.08s)]
*  You can't really control it. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1898.8s)]
*  Whereas this, you can control the dose. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1900.16s)]
*  It has a half life. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1902.32s)]
*  It has a maximum concentration, which then fades over time. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1903.52s)]
*  And that's a function of the dose that you give. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1907.76s)]
*  So there's much more like a traditional pharmaceutical in that way. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1909.76s)]
*  There's CAR-T companies that, of course, want to defend their turf and their franchises. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1916.0s)]
*  But there's also many things about this that would be appealing to a pharma player that [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1920.64s)]
*  isn't in cell therapy because those who might have find cell therapy a bit fiddly would probably [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1926.4s)]
*  find LNPs, well, it's more fiddly than a small molecule, a lot less fiddly than a cell therapy. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1931.92s)]
*  I think that's an interesting point, too, because we live therapeutically within the [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1937.44s)]
*  ATMP space right now. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1942.96s)]
*  And so everything's kind of been marketed or positioned as this one and done, which I think [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1944.96s)]
*  can have sort of a sexy bit of allure, especially for a therapeutic that can be very expensive. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1951.1200000000001s)]
*  The prospect of a durable potential cure. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1959.1200000000001s)]
*  Not everything approved has been curative, but that one and done does have some appeal to it. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1964.8s)]
*  But the fact that I think, too, investors can be aware of if RNA is a chronically [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1971.76s)]
*  dosed therapy that fits similar to a biologic, that sort of that risk proposition is understood. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1978.32s)]
*  It's well known. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1986.0s)]
*  But I'm curious, do you find that navigating the funding today has changed at all? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1987.2s)]
*  As more players come into the space with RNA, as the space, we're not mature by any sense of [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1993.28s)]
*  the word, but as we have moved beyond the pandemic realm, are you finding that [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=1999.84s)]
*  investors are interested in different types of information or data or has getting funds become [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2008.24s)]
*  more challenging in any way? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2014.32s)]
*  It's an interesting question. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2019.12s)]
*  I think as a company progresses through its stages, as its own story advances, its pipeline [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2020.64s)]
*  advances, then what you want from or need from the funding and the scale of funding you need [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2028.5600000000002s)]
*  inherently changes. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2034.5600000000002s)]
*  So you're not appealing to the same necessarily. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2036.0s)]
*  You start with a venture appeal and then later on you're appealing to different kind of later [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2038.96s)]
*  stage investors and ultimately pre-public investors and ultimately public investors. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2046.24s)]
*  And these investors are all looking for different things, different proof points. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2051.2s)]
*  You can probably distinguish them based on their own response profile, where they feel [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2058.08s)]
*  their sweet spot is and where they like to get in. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2062.64s)]
*  In terms of our story, our story resonates, in the case of Ornette, resonates pretty well. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2067.28s)]
*  What we're trying to do is relatively differentiated. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2072.48s)]
*  So it's not just the name that people remember, but they do tend to recall that we're doing [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2078.32s)]
*  what we call now pan car because our lipids don't just deliver to T cells. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2083.6800000000003s)]
*  So if you have a lentivirus, it's going to find the T cells because it's a T cell tropic virus. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2088.6400000000003s)]
*  Whereas our particles are pan lineage. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2093.6000000000004s)]
*  They go to T's, NK's and macrophages. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2097.84s)]
*  And so to the point that people feel cell therapy have only scratched the surface, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2100.72s)]
*  yes, you have some people doing car T's, you have some people doing car NK's. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2105.12s)]
*  Car M's. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2108.3999999999996s)]
*  And the whole company is doing car max, car M's. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2108.96s)]
*  Well, we do all three with one injection. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2112.96s)]
*  We create all three with one injection. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2115.92s)]
*  So that's why we call it pan car rather than, and we call it in-viva car rather than in-viva [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2119.04s)]
*  car T because we're reaching all the effective lineages in the immune system. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2124.16s)]
*  So people like that. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2128.7999999999997s)]
*  And the potential that we could do something in solids is there without having to change [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2130.7999999999997s)]
*  anything of what we do because we're in the macrophage already. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2135.92s)]
*  We just have to think about what the target is. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2140.48s)]
*  What does the car target? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2144.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2146.08s)]
*  But look, there are companies out there already trying to blaze a trail in car max space. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2146.8799999999997s)]
*  We're content right now to be looking at relatively tried and true targets. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2152.24s)]
*  This is one of the, I think, rules of bringing new technology forward is you don't want to [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2156.48s)]
*  stack your risk. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2161.04s)]
*  You don't want to try new biology and new technology. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2162.16s)]
*  So our technology is new. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2165.44s)]
*  So we are using a fairly vanilla target. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2167.2s)]
*  It helps us compare and contrast, but it also helps everybody understand what you have in [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2170.64s)]
*  that way. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2177.36s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2178.16s)]
*  That's an interesting point. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2178.96s)]
*  We've been spending a lot of time talking about upshot. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2180.64s)]
*  I'm curious, Dr. Barnes, what you're, like, if you do a risk analysis, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2182.96s)]
*  of the company between now and your next, like, big important milestone, what could go wrong? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2187.04s)]
*  I mean, yeah, she laughs because, like, you know, a lot. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2194.56s)]
*  All of the things that can go wrong can go wrong. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2199.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2204.2400000000002s)]
*  There's a large number of them. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2204.96s)]
*  You know, I think LNPs are no different. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2208.7200000000003s)]
*  The RNA is no different. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2211.12s)]
*  You can have timing delays. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2212.8s)]
*  You can have manufacturing snags. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2215.6s)]
*  You can have translation issues. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2217.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, ultimately, whatever you've seen, you get a different result in people. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2220.08s)]
*  You know, it's drug development. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2225.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2228.0s)]
*  It's a low probability business from where you start to the chances that you'll get an [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2228.56s)]
*  approval, right? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2235.68s)]
*  You have to start so many threads that one of them is going to make it all the way through. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2237.2s)]
*  But, you know, you try and shorten your odds by getting the right kind of proof points [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2242.48s)]
*  in animals in vitro ahead of time. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2249.2000000000003s)]
*  You shorten your odds by using a known biology. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2252.1600000000003s)]
*  But, yeah, there's many things that can. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2256.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I probably should have qualified the question a little more. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2258.6400000000003s)]
*  I would, which, I mean, you know. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2261.36s)]
*  You liked it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2262.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, it was a good question. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2263.2000000000003s)]
*  It was a great question. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2264.1600000000003s)]
*  With a lot of different answers. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2265.52s)]
*  We don't think enough about it, that's for sure. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2266.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2268.2400000000002s)]
*  If I were to narrow that question, though, I probably would have asked, like, organizationally, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2269.54s)]
*  structurally, you know, in terms of people, talent, manufacturing capacity. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2274.18s)]
*  Like, assuming the science goes as well as science does during drug development, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2280.5s)]
*  what that's within your control as the, you know, captain of the ship? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2285.8599999999997s)]
*  Are you potentially anticipating, you know, a challenge around? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2290.5s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of good companies competing for talent. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2294.18s)]
*  So everything that happens is done by the people in the company. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2300.8999999999996s)]
*  So you have to be good at, I mean, as a group, as a company, as attracting talent. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2304.66s)]
*  And when people are here, it's got to be an environment where they like to stay. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2311.7s)]
*  They can always leave. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2316.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, the best retention tool that you have is have people not want to leave. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2318.2599999999998s)]
*  Not, you know, golden handcuffs or other sort of perks. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2324.3399999999997s)]
*  Just create an environment where people feel seen, heard, appreciated, where they feel they, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2328.98s)]
*  you know, they participate, they understand what's going on. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2338.3399999999997s)]
*  Something I'm always driven for is transparency as much as I can, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2341.2999999999997s)]
*  so that everybody has a common sense of what we're doing, where we are, what's going on. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2345.22s)]
*  I mean, obviously, there are limits, but as much as I can. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2350.1s)]
*  And I think that tends to help people buy into the mission. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2352.98s)]
*  One of the things that people often say after they've interviewed here is that everybody [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2357.14s)]
*  said exactly the same thing in terms of what we're doing, what the mission is. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2362.1800000000003s)]
*  There's no duality or multiplicity of views because we all have the same, we have a common view. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2365.78s)]
*  So I think that that's people talk about culture as being important. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2373.06s)]
*  I think it often comes across sounding very platitudinous, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2377.54s)]
*  but I think culture is very important in terms of retaining people because when you're [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2380.5s)]
*  in a good one, you know it. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2384.74s)]
*  And then, you know, things do go awry or sideways from time to time. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2386.82s)]
*  And that is where the true value of culture emerges because that's if, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2391.62s)]
*  if like, well, I'm here because, you know, the pay is good and we're on a ride away from my [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2396.34s)]
*  stock to vest, then it goes south. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2400.9s)]
*  It's like, oh, my stock isn't worth anything. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2402.66s)]
*  Everybody's out the door. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2404.34s)]
*  I mean, if it's a place that people don't want to be at, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2405.46s)]
*  but if it's a place that people do want to be at, they say, well, you know what? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2408.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to stay. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2411.5400000000004s)]
*  I'm going to see this through. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2412.42s)]
*  And that, that I think is the real value of having a place where people like to work. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2414.34s)]
*  You mentioned it's a competitive space to find talent. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2421.38s)]
*  Is that more specifically so when you're dealing with circular RNA or are there [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2427.86s)]
*  transferable skills perhaps from people who've worked in other, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2433.7000000000003s)]
*  other labs and other modalities? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2437.06s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2439.46s)]
*  There's plenty of transferable skills. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2440.9s)]
*  RNA is still hot. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2443.46s)]
*  So you, you know, it's still, I think attracts talent. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2446.66s)]
*  Circular RNA, perhaps a little better than regular, another regular linear RNA company. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2450.98s)]
*  Unless it's an editing company, I think editing still has cache in that way. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2458.82s)]
*  But yes, it would be, you know, it'd be different if we were doing [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2463.2999999999997s)]
*  a new kind of small molecule, a new kind of chemistry, or it's an old kind of chemistry, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2470.66s)]
*  but a new kind of target that we've chosen here to take biological risk. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2475.14s)]
*  Because hey, we found new targets. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2478.5s)]
*  That's, that's what we're going after. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2480.66s)]
*  That's the hypothesis we're going to test when we get to the clinic. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2482.2599999999998s)]
*  That is, I think, I think it's, it's just, unless you're good at telling the story, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2486.2599999999998s)]
*  or there's something really compelling that tends to inspire a little bit less readily [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2492.58s)]
*  than, you know, gee whiz technology. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2498.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2501.7s)]
*  But yeah, I'm going to shift gears here a little bit. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2502.02s)]
*  Time flies when you're having fun. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2505.7s)]
*  You know, we are going to run short on time here. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2507.14s)]
*  So I'm going to shift gears. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2508.8199999999997s)]
*  I'd like to give you an opportunity to talk a little bit about your partnership strategy. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2509.86s)]
*  I think you mentioned you found, you found solid support from [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2513.2999999999997s)]
*  pharma, you know, biopharma companies, and you've got specifically partnerships with Merck and [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2517.7s)]
*  Renegade Therapeutics, maybe others. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2522.5s)]
*  So share a little bit about those partnerships and what sort of your strategy as the leader [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2525.7799999999997s)]
*  at ORNA has been in establishing those partnerships. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2529.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2534.18s)]
*  So the strategy, I think, that noise is not coming through. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2534.42s)]
*  The strategy really derives from the fact that we have a true platform. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2540.42s)]
*  People like to say they have platforms and investors like to invest. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2547.06s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2549.7799999999997s)]
*  Everybody says they have a platform. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2550.98s)]
*  Investors like to invest in platforms because it means if the first thing doesn't work, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2552.42s)]
*  you've got a second thing. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2555.22s)]
*  The alternative to a platform is a single asset play. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2556.02s)]
*  But it turns out that it's not a binary thing. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2559.62s)]
*  Platforms, or at least an approach which give two or three products, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2563.2999999999997s)]
*  okay, that's most things. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2566.74s)]
*  It's less common to have a platform that could really do a vast number. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2568.74s)]
*  Editing was one, certainly, because a lot of the liver targets were all picked over. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2572.1s)]
*  But in the early days, it was all there. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2576.5s)]
*  It was all there to be done. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2578.42s)]
*  And it's almost like this embarrassment of riches of the number of things you can do. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2580.26s)]
*  And the same is true for RNA, for our approach. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2584.02s)]
*  I mean, we have fewer people than Moderna, but we are doing fundamentally the same thing as Moderna. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2586.58s)]
*  We are putting a long coding RNA into a particle and administering it IV. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2593.7s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2598.98s)]
*  Our RNA has a different shape and we have other advantages, we think, that we can do it. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2600.66s)]
*  Their delivery is different than our delivery. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2605.46s)]
*  That's the fundamental thing. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2606.98s)]
*  The topology of the payload matters, lines versus circles. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2609.86s)]
*  You know, I argue circles are better. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2613.46s)]
*  But they're not necessarily the killer app back here. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2615.46s)]
*  I think the real killer app is the delivery. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2618.58s)]
*  We were the first to show immunotropic lipids. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2621.3s)]
*  Now everyone's looking for them and trying to replicate what we've shown. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2623.3s)]
*  But until we showed it was possible, no one was really doing that. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2626.58s)]
*  So in terms of partnerships, then you look across all the things you could do. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2630.34s)]
*  And there's like, oh, there's so many things that you can do and you can't do it all. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2638.6600000000003s)]
*  I think the mistake a lot of companies do is say, mind, mind, mind, we're going to do it all. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2643.2200000000003s)]
*  But, you know, one of the things I like to say, I like to challenge people is how many [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2648.26s)]
*  products does it take to make a successful biotech company? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2654.26s)]
*  That's just one. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2657.2200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, how many of these things do you really need? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2658.58s)]
*  So it kind of defies the partner strategy. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2661.38s)]
*  We pick the area we declared we're going for in VivoCar. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2663.54s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2666.82s)]
*  And we will, this doesn't mean the partner is off the table, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2668.42s)]
*  but the kind of partnership we're looking for is going to be very different, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2671.3s)]
*  more selective, narrower. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2674.26s)]
*  And everything else that we can do, we'll partner that. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2676.42s)]
*  We'll partner that out. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2680.18s)]
*  We're opening to partnering that out. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2680.98s)]
*  And so that is the basis of the Merck relationship, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2683.2200000000003s)]
*  which is primarily focused on infectious disease. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2686.5s)]
*  So we weren't going to do anything in that space. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2689.3s)]
*  Particularly, we were a little bit late to the party. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2694.34s)]
*  But even before the pandemic, we were founded not to do vaccines. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2696.1s)]
*  We were founded to pursue in VivoCar. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2700.5s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2702.9s)]
*  Now, the relationship with Merck goes a little bit beyond infectious disease as well. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2705.06s)]
*  I think they have had relationships with other linear RNA companies. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2708.34s)]
*  And so they have an interest in the space. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2712.82s)]
*  So it goes a little bit beyond that. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2714.5s)]
*  In the case of Renegade, Renegade was a company also came from the same stable. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2716.9s)]
*  It's another NPM company. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2720.34s)]
*  It was founded about two years after us. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2722.66s)]
*  And it was going to address the delivery question. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2727.22s)]
*  So it's going to be delivery focused, not payload focused. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2730.1s)]
*  It was going to be relatively payload agnostic. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2733.38s)]
*  And so we thought, well, okay, we could always use some cool new delivery. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2736.66s)]
*  So that was the relationship. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2742.18s)]
*  But we all. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2743.14s)]
*  That was the relationship with Renegade as they were building things out. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2743.78s)]
*  Now, of course, they one of the places they started to see is could they get a better [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2748.7400000000002s)]
*  vaccine leopard? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2753.94s)]
*  And so the relationship with Merck came along at a time. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2755.46s)]
*  We already had some early hits out of that. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2759.7000000000003s)]
*  And so that the Merck deal is actually a three-way deal between Warner, Merck, and Renegade. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2762.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, but yeah, we continue to work with Renegade on other things. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2770.1s)]
*  So there is another deal with a Chinese company called Simnova, which is a member of the Simsea [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2775.86s)]
*  family. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2781.78s)]
*  And that was an opportunity to, from our perspective, firstly, doing excellent work there, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2782.9s)]
*  discovering novel binders, novel CAR proteins, which they're clinically validating themselves. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2787.7000000000003s)]
*  So it was a way to potentially get access to that, but also to get access to accelerated [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2792.5s)]
*  clinical evaluation through a particular setup that they have in China called [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2797.7s)]
*  investigator-initiated trials. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2802.02s)]
*  It's just something that most Chinese companies do and something that we could do with them [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2803.9399999999996s)]
*  in our collaboration. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2812.5s)]
*  So that was appealing to us as well. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2813.46s)]
*  I like to think we were already thinking globally, but actually there was a practical [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2816.18s)]
*  angle to that. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2821.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2823.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2823.86s)]
*  What about clinical opportunities in Australia? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2824.18s)]
*  That seems to be all the rage right now. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2827.62s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2829.7799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2830.42s)]
*  In terms of not so much the investigator-initiated, in terms of formal evaluation, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2831.38s)]
*  the Australian environment is obviously a top-notch medical society, medical healthcare [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2835.54s)]
*  society. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2844.98s)]
*  It has typically simpler review processes, shorter times. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2846.34s)]
*  And there's a particular interest in drawing RNA investment into Australia by governmental [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2851.78s)]
*  agencies. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2858.7400000000002s)]
*  So there are various financial incentives of going down there as well. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2859.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2864.5s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2864.98s)]
*  It's positioning itself quite nicely as a hub over the past couple of years. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2866.5s)]
*  It seems like there's a lot of really exciting mRNA stuff going on in Australia. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2871.46s)]
*  We don't want to hype it too much. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2875.06s)]
*  We drew Dr. Barnes to Boston. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2876.34s)]
*  We don't want to lose him to Sydney. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2880.02s)]
*  In the time that we have left, let's talk about where the space is going. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2887.7799999999997s)]
*  I've been somewhat obsessed, so I'm going to selfishly ask the next question because [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2893.7s)]
*  I'm really curious to hear your answer. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2897.54s)]
*  I feel like I might already know it, just given your love of RNA, circular RNA. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2899.3799999999997s)]
*  But I'd really love to... [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2904.74s)]
*  I often am talking about the RNA toolbox, the identity proposition that the different [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2906.66s)]
*  modalities can play within the broader biologic space, even just within the mRNA sector as [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2913.14s)]
*  a whole, right? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2918.5s)]
*  Moving from, I think the space in general is moving towards some of these next-gen [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2920.02s)]
*  modalities more regularly away from the linear mRNA for a number of different reasons. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2924.02s)]
*  But I'm curious to hear how you foresee circular RNA really fitting into or perhaps dominating. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2929.46s)]
*  Do you see it fitting into more as one tool in the toolbox, applicable only in very specific [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2937.94s)]
*  use cases? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2945.7000000000003s)]
*  Or do you see it being used in partnership with a lot of different mRNA therapies and [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2946.42s)]
*  biologics? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2951.86s)]
*  Or do you just kind of see it dominating the space? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2952.6600000000003s)]
*  Does it become the one to throw in a Lord of the Rings joke, the one ring to rule them [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2956.02s)]
*  all? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2963.3s)]
*  You're welcome to steal that as well, by the way, but we might get in trouble with the [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2965.54s)]
*  Tolkien. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2971.7000000000003s)]
*  It's an interesting question. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2975.38s)]
*  Right now, there are certain IP barriers to getting into circular RNA. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2978.58s)]
*  But in the academic world, of course, they're free to do research. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2984.66s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of circular research going on right now using the method that Alex [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2989.7000000000003s)]
*  and Dan invented because it's just so easy and they don't have a constraint that way. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=2995.78s)]
*  So there's going to definitely be ongoing research with circles or what you can do with [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3000.58s)]
*  circles. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3008.18s)]
*  The main limitation, though, the thing that will limit its reach is how many different [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3009.06s)]
*  delivery solutions you can... [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3013.7s)]
*  If all you have is liver delivery, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day whether [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3015.54s)]
*  it's a circle or a line. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3019.3799999999997s)]
*  You might get slightly different performance. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3020.3399999999997s)]
*  But what is really going to push things forward is the delivery question. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3022.2599999999998s)]
*  And at that point, if you were forced to suffer with the mere linear RNA but you had a very, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3030.58s)]
*  very cool new delivery, you can make fine products with that. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3036.66s)]
*  And nothing's prevented in that way. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3039.46s)]
*  Mind you, if you had a circle, it would just be easier and better. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3043.46s)]
*  So I think people are going to continue studying natural circles. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3047.86s)]
*  That still is a bit of a mystery what they're doing there. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3053.46s)]
*  I think people are going to do some technical innovations. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3056.26s)]
*  An area where we've been focused technically on the circle side is how you get expression [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3059.2200000000003s)]
*  because there is no cap. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3064.5s)]
*  There's no end to the RNA. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3066.02s)]
*  So you have to mark the start of the protein with a different sequence element. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3067.7s)]
*  Single-stranded RNA viruses use a trick to do that. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3073.86s)]
*  And that's where we're drawing our inspiration from. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3077.38s)]
*  But I think we've been leading in that space. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3079.86s)]
*  We've been the first to really explore that in more of an omics way. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3082.7400000000002s)]
*  And so we're really trying to define the universe of possible ways of expressing, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3086.1s)]
*  at least as already instantiated in nature. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3092.9s)]
*  Obviously, you could go into random sequences, but amongst those that are out there. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3097.38s)]
*  And there's a lot that are out there. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3100.82s)]
*  So it is a little bit daunting. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3102.18s)]
*  And we use omics approaches. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3104.2599999999998s)]
*  We use machine learning to get after all that. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3107.2999999999997s)]
*  So I think notwithstanding the IP barriers, I think there will continue to be a lot of [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3110.02s)]
*  interest in circles. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3116.18s)]
*  And there'll be a lot of people trying to work their way around those patents in some way. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3117.62s)]
*  They'll just be straight up very clever ideas that are very different to the ones that we have [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3123.22s)]
*  that get you there. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3128.02s)]
*  Once you have the circle, you will enjoy all those advantages. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3128.82s)]
*  Now, of course, you still have to express. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3133.38s)]
*  And so that's why we think the expression system might be another line of defense. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3135.38s)]
*  I know you're trying to think about opening doors. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3140.1000000000004s)]
*  And here I am talking about closing doors. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3142.6600000000003s)]
*  I think that's an important conversation to have, to be honest. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3144.5800000000004s)]
*  You need to talk about some of the potential door closers as well. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3147.1400000000003s)]
*  This is new. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3151.3s)]
*  But we want to protect it. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3151.94s)]
*  That's where our value is. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3154.6600000000003s)]
*  So but when you look across the modalities, and there are companies now doing tRNA. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3156.98s)]
*  The idea is that it's basically nonsense suppression, stop code on suppression. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3164.18s)]
*  So all those genetic diseases which have a premature termination code on maybe one therapy, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3168.66s)]
*  it's a very intriguing idea. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3174.18s)]
*  And so there's going to be continuing approaches with RNA. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3176.42s)]
*  I think less about circles versus lines, but creativity will emerge in other ways. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3181.7s)]
*  So tRNA, or we see RNA editing as something that's out there now. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3187.62s)]
*  Or there'll be other kinds of RNA splicing things that are going on. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3193.22s)]
*  I mean, so there'll be RNA this and RNA that for sure. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3197.06s)]
*  Yeah, a whole universe of opportunities that will work in parallel, most likely to each other, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3200.98s)]
*  not just one ring to rule them all, one solution. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3207.54s)]
*  Not if Dr. Barnes has. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3214.34s)]
*  Dr. Barnes, 2020 was an interesting time to start a biotech company. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3218.34s)]
*  What do you wish you knew then that you know now? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3225.38s)]
*  Whether that answer is specific to just biotech leadership in general [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3230.02s)]
*  or specific to the RNA space. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3233.7s)]
*  So I'm a first time CEO. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3238.02s)]
*  So back when I was starting, I had to at least have the courage of my convictions [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3241.38s)]
*  that I could do a halfway decent job at it. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3247.06s)]
*  And I learned what it really feels like being a CEO. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3251.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure I would just get ready for the ride is maybe what I tell myself, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3257.86s)]
*  but I'm not really sure my younger self would have even understood. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3262.1s)]
*  Oh, it will be like this. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3266.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think you have to sort of live through it to really sort of sense. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3267.62s)]
*  It's a very central role, I think, at the CEO level, particularly in the early days. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3274.98s)]
*  You basically have to do a lot of different things because the team is not fully fledged. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3280.5s)]
*  But then as it grows, then what you're trying to do shifts and evolves and changes. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3287.54s)]
*  And there's raising money. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3292.98s)]
*  Is the story good enough? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3295.7000000000003s)]
*  How do you polishing your craft in terms of pitching and getting people interested in what [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3296.98s)]
*  you're doing, getting the message across succinctly or in an exciting way? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3302.6600000000003s)]
*  And there's your board as well, making sure everything is very smooth and aligned there. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3308.82s)]
*  I've been in any number of board meetings before as a participant, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3317.1400000000003s)]
*  but not as a CEO, which is a far more central function in that. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3321.06s)]
*  So that was maybe the newest thing to me because I'd done early stage startups before where [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3326.02s)]
*  they didn't have the title CEO. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3333.22s)]
*  I was basically doing everything anyway. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3334.42s)]
*  So the early phases of Warner were very familiar. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3336.1s)]
*  Yes, I don't know that there's advice, just to say that it's a lot. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3341.2999999999997s)]
*  It's a big role. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3347.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's advice in all of it. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3348.5s)]
*  I ask questions like that all the time of my guests, specifically scientists turn CEO. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3350.82s)]
*  And the answers are wildly varying, but there's meat in all of them. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3358.42s)]
*  Someone's going to take something away from it. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3363.78s)]
*  So just one follow up to that and then we'll let you get on with your day. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3365.6200000000003s)]
*  You said, get ready for the ride. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3370.34s)]
*  Looking back, what aspects of the ride were you perhaps the least prepared for? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3372.6600000000003s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3381.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, we went through some interesting macro factors. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3386.02s)]
*  I've been in biotech long enough. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3389.2200000000003s)]
*  I've seen various macro factors. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3390.6600000000003s)]
*  Employee, things go up, things go down, but it was other people's responsibility in some [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3392.34s)]
*  ways to deal with it or ensure the health of the company. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3396.42s)]
*  And there was the big boom time in 21 and then it all went south and the investment dried up. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3399.94s)]
*  So that's really out of your control as you're presented with a scenario and you have to solve [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3410.82s)]
*  for what you're trying to solve for. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3421.1400000000003s)]
*  And then if the conditions change, you have to re-solve for that. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3423.2200000000003s)]
*  So that's less, and that's not you. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3426.26s)]
*  I mean, that's your team at that point. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3430.1000000000004s)]
*  That's everybody from your board to your executive team to yourself. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3431.6200000000003s)]
*  And then everybody in the company is trying to create value through what they do. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3436.1800000000003s)]
*  The path to salvation is value creation. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3441.14s)]
*  I didn't mean for that to rhyme, but it did. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3443.7799999999997s)]
*  You're a poet. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3446.8199999999997s)]
*  And I don't know it. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3448.5s)]
*  The conversation's coming full circle. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3451.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3453.22s)]
*  Do you see what I did? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3454.02s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3454.66s)]
*  Just so anyway, that's the ride I would say in this particular case. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3458.5s)]
*  It could have been a very smooth, a steady period in biotech over this last little while, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3463.7799999999997s)]
*  but it's definitely been up and down. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3468.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3471.38s)]
*  Prepare to wear many hats, in other words. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3472.34s)]
*  Well, I could selfishly continue this conversation for quite some time [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3476.5s)]
*  because I've enjoyed it thoroughly. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3480.66s)]
*  I think co-hosting's fun. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3482.02s)]
*  It is fun. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3484.18s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3484.8199999999997s)]
*  We're going to do more of this. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3485.54s)]
*  Yeah, RNA. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3486.5s)]
*  I'm going to find RNA companies so that I can just- [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3488.2599999999998s)]
*  RNA companies, pitch mat. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3490.5s)]
*  And the light lifting and- [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3491.86s)]
*  You'll get this. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3493.14s)]
*  Things that you know about. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3493.7799999999997s)]
*  You'll get this. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3494.1s)]
*  Dr. Barnes, we really appreciate you coming on. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3496.2599999999998s)]

*  Thanks Anna Rose. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3504.02s)]
*  We'll revisit maybe down the road when there's another inflection point to talk about. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3506.02s)]
*  We'll catch up with Orna. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBsNtV2gwoo&t=3509.78s)]
