# Genomically-Guided Medicine With Elevation Oncology's Shawn Leland, PharmD, RPh
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [April 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk)
*  Precision medicine is personalized medicine. And in biologic therapies, getting personal means [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=0.0s)]
*  getting to know patients at the genomic level. I'm Matt Piller, and this is the business of biotech. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=8.76s)]
*  On today's show, precision medicine is precisely what we're talking about with Sean Leland, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  PharmD, a young founder and CEO doing exciting things with precision oncology therapeutics at [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=20.84s)]
*  Elevation Oncology. A little bit about Sean, after earning his PharmD from Albany College of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=28.08s)]
*  Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Dr. Leland's profession took him all over the health sciences [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=34.04s)]
*  career map from doing clinical management work at Albany Medical Center and Pfizer to oncology [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=39.44s)]
*  research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, to retail pharmacy work to a postdoctoral fellowship [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=45.84s)]
*  and teaching stint at Rutgers Ernesto Mario School of Pharmacy. And then back to the business [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=52.76s)]
*  side of things, doing R&D at Eli Lilly and working on oncology at Ariad Pharmaceuticals. Before [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=59.64s)]
*  founding Elevation in 2019, he even spent a few years doing business development at Argos [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=67.32s)]
*  Therapeutics and Verisstem and consulting at Catinion. Sean, welcome to the show. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=72.72s)]
*  Thanks, Matt. Yeah, pleasure to be here today. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=80.12s)]
*  It's my pleasure to have you. And you know, I wanted to chat with you about this because your [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=81.84s)]
*  multifaceted experience certainly lends itself to leadership of a biopharma company. And it's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=86.56s)]
*  particularly interesting to me to look at the places your career has taken you already. I mean, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=94.08s)]
*  you're young, you know, came out of Albany in what, 08? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=99.44s)]
*  Yep, 2008. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=103.92s)]
*  Yeah. So in that short period of time, you've done a whole bunch of stuff. And it's very [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=105.52s)]
*  interesting to me, because I know ACPHS President Greg Dewey, Dr. Dewey and I have spoken multiple [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=109.52s)]
*  times, I've written about him. And I've written specifically about his intentions to broaden the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=116.72s)]
*  curriculum there at ACPHS to create opportunities for PharmDs beyond retail pharmacy. I mean, you [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=121.52s)]
*  are a retail pharmacist for less than a year. It's like this little blip on your radar. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  So it occurred to me that if Dr. Dewey hasn't had you back on campus as a guest lecturer, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=135.52s)]
*  like multiple times yet, I anticipate that he will be there very soon. So keep your eyes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  out for that. It's only a matter of time. But what was your kind of what was your worldview coming [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=146.4s)]
*  out of ACPHS with that PharmD degree? You know, it's okay if you didn't have a definitive plan. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=151.52s)]
*  But what was sort of the plan? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, my plan coming out of pharmacy school was, I thought I was on a path to being a clinical [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=160.48s)]
*  pharmacist. You know, that was kind of my focus. I really had this, you know, strong passion for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  cardiovascular disease, diabetes, critical care. That was largely stimulated by some of the, you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  know, health challenges that, you know, I saw my dad deal with, you know, starting kind of my senior [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=182.32s)]
*  year of high school and beyond that, you know, dealing with diabetes, you know, dealing with heart [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=188.08s)]
*  disease. So that was kind of an area where, you know, I wanted to, you know, focus my education [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=193.12s)]
*  and then my professional career upon. It was really up until my, you know, last year at pharmacy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=199.68s)]
*  school when I was doing my, you know, clerkship rotations, where the first rotation I went on [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=206.72000000000003s)]
*  was, you know, an oncology rotation at Russell Park Cancer Institute, where my career quickly [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=213.36s)]
*  changed from, you know, wanting to do something in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, critical care, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=220.16s)]
*  to, you know, wanting to help patients with cancer. You know, I thought, you know, in pharmacy school [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=227.2s)]
*  that I'm like, oh, everything is based upon what's in the textbook. And, you know, you treat patients [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=234.0s)]
*  that way. And I quickly realized that, you know, it's not only just treating patients with [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=239.44s)]
*  standard of care therapy, but it's also, you know, exposing them to research and clinical trials [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=245.76s)]
*  and being a part of, you know, innovation and advancing the field of medicine. And, you know, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=252.16s)]
*  where that was moving the quickest, you know, at the time, and I would say even currently today [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  is within the field of oncology. So I quickly found myself being immersed in clinical trials, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=263.44s)]
*  and that really stimulated kind of my passion for research and the field of oncology drug development. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=270.24s)]
*  The second rotation I did, and this is something that, you know, was not emphasized, I didn't even, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=278.32s)]
*  you know, really realize that this was a career path forward, you know, when I was going through [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=284.16s)]
*  pharmacy school, I thought there was two tracks. There was the retail path, and then there was the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=288.4s)]
*  hospital clinical pharmacy path. Like those are really kind of the only, you know, two paths that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  I was aware of at the time. And my second rotation found me at Pfizer, you know, working hand in hand [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=298.88s)]
*  with the medical science liaison. And I realized, you know, being able to combine kind of science [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=306.23999999999995s)]
*  and business was really where my kind of like true passion was. So this ability to, you know, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=312.8s)]
*  work for a pharmaceutical biotech company also came into play, you know, kind of during my [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=318.64s)]
*  clerkship rotations early on. And, you know, that took me into, you know, going to, you know, the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=324.16s)]
*  ASHP annual convention where you apply for, you know, pharmacy residencies and pharmacy fellowship [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  programs, you know, where I thought I would be going in and applying for, you know, a residency [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=339.68s)]
*  program, you know, doing clinical pharmacy, I found myself quickly changed paths, and I found myself [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=345.04s)]
*  applying for, you know, pharmaceutical industry fellowship programs in the field of oncology. So, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, all of that transpired over a very short period of time, basically, you know, over a course [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=357.12s)]
*  of 15 weeks of, you know, doing those first, you know, two pharmacy clerkship rotations, in addition [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=363.68s)]
*  to, you know, spending time and doing some research at Roswell Park, where I had a clerkship rotation [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=370.72s)]
*  off in between, you know, Roswell Park and Pfizer. Yeah, very cool. Your Roswell Park time, was that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=376.24s)]
*  spent in Buffalo? Yes. Yeah, I grew up in Hamburg, New York, just a little bit south of Buffalo, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=382.48s)]
*  Buffalo guy. This for, you know, for, I don't know where you ended up on the football spectrum, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=387.52s)]
*  Dr. Leland, but this episode will air several weeks from today, but tonight the Buffalo Bills [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=393.36s)]
*  are preparing for, you know, Monday night football. So I don't know if you'll be tuning into that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=399.6s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be a big game. Yeah, no exception for the Bills game. You know, watched a lot of football [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=403.92s)]
*  this weekend. We caught the Bears game against Packers and the Steelers Seahawks game, and over [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=410.16s)]
*  time with the Steelers win is really where my heart resides. Okay. All right. Good. Good. Yeah, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=416.48s)]
*  for sure. We watched some of that too. Yeah. So Roswell Park's a great place to be as far as the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=422.64s)]
*  study of oncology goes. I actually, I went to UB, another pretty good pharmacy school in its own, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=427.84s)]
*  right? Right. So common connections there. At what point did you decide or even start thinking [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=433.2s)]
*  about entrepreneurship? I mean, this is, so as I said, there's an excellent base in your CV to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=440.4s)]
*  set you up for, hey, I've got a lot of experience from every facet of running a business in life [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=449.04s)]
*  sciences and specifically around development of drugs. But it's a whole other step to say, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=454.56s)]
*  let's raise some money and start a company. Yeah. So for me, I mean, like I think I touched pieces [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=461.36s)]
*  of this, you know, probably early on in my career. I mean, I think part of this is kind of a key [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=467.68s)]
*  component to doing business development. So, you know, after I spent the first year and a half of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=473.44s)]
*  my career at Eli Lilly, you know, doing oncology research and development, you know, and then I [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=480.08s)]
*  got pulled into working in oncology search and evaluation hand in hand with the oncology leadership [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=486.8s)]
*  team, you know, scouting assets for unlicensing and companies for mergers and acquisitions, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=491.76s)]
*  you know, very cross-functional role, very technical role, you know, performing due diligence [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=497.2s)]
*  on a variety of different assets and, you know, making formal recommendations to the oncology [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=501.68s)]
*  leadership team at Lilly, you know, to guide which products we would license and which companies we [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=507.04s)]
*  would go out and pursue for, you know, for mergers acquisitions. And, you know, I think that got me [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=513.28s)]
*  thinking in that entrepreneurial direction, you know, after I left Lilly and went to Ariad, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=519.6s)]
*  you know, working closely with, you know, researchers, clinicians in the field, I feel [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=527.28s)]
*  like you've come across good ideas all the time. It's just a question of, you know, do you have the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=532.32s)]
*  gestalt to take it to that next level and say, this is a really good idea. No one's out there doing [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=538.08s)]
*  this. I'm going to, you know, become an expert on this, you know, topic, this target, this drug. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=544.48s)]
*  And I'm going to go out and try to pitch this idea to investors, raise money around it, and put a [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=552.6400000000001s)]
*  company in place. You know, that took some time. You know, I think when I was 27, I came across an [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=557.7600000000001s)]
*  idea and concept that I saw another individual take the same idea and concept that I had come [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=566.96s)]
*  across, you know, six to 12 months later and turn that into, you know, something really special that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  helped a lot of patients. And I think once you see one of those go by, you are a lot more likely to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  pursue this and go down this path. So, you know, the opportunity to execute on something like this [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=590.88s)]
*  came across, you know, kind of my plate in November of 2018, which is where I came across this idea of, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  you know, forming elevation oncology. I was sitting in a scientific presentation at a conference in [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=605.3599999999999s)]
*  Munich and, you know, Alex Drillen from Memorial Sloan Kettering, who's a, you know, world-known [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=613.04s)]
*  precision oncology physician and medical oncologist in New York, you know, he was presenting on this [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  concept of targeted therapies in lung cancer. And he had one slide on this target called Neregulin [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=625.28s)]
*  1 or NRG1 gene fusions and was a target I had never seen before. I actually knew nothing about [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=630.8s)]
*  the target, but, you know, listening to him describe the target and some of the unique [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=636.4799999999999s)]
*  features of the biology, the fact that it was rare, the fact that they had identified in [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=641.76s)]
*  multiple types of cancer, and it was a genomic marker there that carried that hallmark of being [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=646.8s)]
*  a true oncogenic driver and that it was predominantly mutually exclusive of other known oncogenic driver [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=652.9599999999999s)]
*  targets, highlighting the fact that if you could identify it with genomic testing, it was the one [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=659.68s)]
*  and only thing driving tumor growth and proliferation and, you know, ideally should be amenable to a [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=664.9599999999999s)]
*  targeted therapy approach with the monotherapy. And on that same slide he presented the biology, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=671.68s)]
*  he also presented a case study highlighting the fact that, you know, you could drug this target, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=677.5999999999999s)]
*  you know, using a monoclonal antibody approach that other companies had developed. But, you know, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=682.8s)]
*  other companies developed this for broad patient populations, different types of cancer, but not [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=688.24s)]
*  selected based upon, you know, a genomic marker that would increase your probability of success [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=694.32s)]
*  of having a positive clinical trial outcome. And, you know, based upon, you know, work that others [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=700.8s)]
*  have done in the field of precision medicine, you know, I was able to, you know, come up with this [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=706.08s)]
*  concept, you know, to where, you know, we did a ton of research, we looked extensively at this target, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=711.36s)]
*  you know, pulled together a pitch deck, got out there, started pitching this idea to investors, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  and then, you know, lo and behold, after pitching this idea to investors, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=724.56s)]
*  running diligence on a variety of different programs against this target, you know, that led [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=729.36s)]
*  to the formation of Elevation Oncology on July 12th of 2019, where, you know, that morning we closed [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=734.56s)]
*  the series A financing, $32.5 million, and then later that afternoon, we closed an asset purchase [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=740.8s)]
*  agreement with Merrimack Pharmaceuticals to acquire Saravansimab, which we are now developing [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=747.5999999999999s)]
*  for patients with solid tumors with, you know, Neregulin 1 or NRG1 gene fusions. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=752.8s)]
*  So, when you, when the brainchild sort of came together, take us back, were you, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=759.04s)]
*  I guess, was the intent to develop a company that was going to build itself around genomic diagnostic, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=765.6s)]
*  genomic testing, or was it the intent to build a company around a therapeutic candidate that took [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=773.6800000000001s)]
*  advantage of these things, or both? Like, what was sort of the original intention of the company? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=779.6s)]
*  Yeah, the original intention of the company was really to, you know, cater to, you know, any type [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=785.36s)]
*  of cancer, you know, that's genomically defined. You know, it's just really kind of the, you know, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=791.04s)]
*  first proof of concept for us, you know, was using Saravansimab to target these patients with [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=798.0s)]
*  NRG1 gene fusion. So, you know, the idea here is to go broad, you know, we want to help a lot of [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=805.04s)]
*  patients with cancer. The idea here isn't to just help one genomically defined patient population, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=812.8s)]
*  and we've started to build, you know, kind of a platform technology, you know, based upon kind [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=818.16s)]
*  of the operational infrastructure that we put in place that we believe, you know, takes precision [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=823.76s)]
*  medicine to the next level and being able to develop drugs, you know, not only just in a [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  timely manner, but also in a very capital efficient manner by, you know, putting in place, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=835.92s)]
*  you know, very specific operational infrastructure that allows us to do that. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=841.6s)]
*  Okay. When you're talking about, when you use the words precision medicine, in your [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=845.6s)]
*  worldview, in the context of what you're doing, are we saying precision medicine is, you know, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=851.12s)]
*  that medicine which is developed and defined by certain genetic, I'm sorry, genomic markers, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  like is that where precision medicine lies, you know, as far as your definition is concerned? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, correct. Yeah, I mean, you're spot on, Matt. I mean, I think what we look for is, you know, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=873.28s)]
*  patients that have undergone genomic sequencing, you know, that genomic sequencing shows a specific [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=879.12s)]
*  genomic alteration, and then figuring out based upon the biology associated with that genomic [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=886.16s)]
*  alteration, is it amenable to being drugged with the therapeutic approach? You know, to me, it comes [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=892.24s)]
*  down to kind of like three things. You know, first of all, you need to, you know, find the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=899.6s)]
*  right physician. You know, I think people, when they're diagnosed with cancer, you know, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=905.84s)]
*  the immediate instinct is to just go to the community oncologist right down the street, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=911.0400000000001s)]
*  closest person. You know, that's not necessarily always the best option. You know, the community [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=915.36s)]
*  oncologist is seeing, you know, hundreds of patients, they are seeing all different types [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=922.72s)]
*  of tumors. And if you're looking for someone who is specialized and focused on the type of cancer, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=928.4s)]
*  if you're looking for, you know, options for, you know, clinical trials, in addition to standard of [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=934.16s)]
*  care, you know, you really need to do your homework and figure out, you know, who's offering [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=940.3199999999999s)]
*  cutting edge technology, what different clinical trials out there, you know, it's not always just [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=947.04s)]
*  about, you know, you're diagnosed with this type of cancer, and we're just going to treat you with [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=952.0s)]
*  chemotherapy or chemo immunotherapy or immunotherapy alone. You know, we really need to kind of take [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=958.56s)]
*  that to the next level. And that starts with, you know, the treating oncologists. You know, to me, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=964.88s)]
*  the next key step is, you know, making sure you're getting genomic testing. If you don't get tested, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=969.84s)]
*  you don't know what is driving your cancer. And, you know, rather than just being exposed to [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=975.52s)]
*  chemotherapy or chemo immunotherapy or immunotherapy alone, which is not going to [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=982.16s)]
*  be specific to your type of cancer, it's not only going to be toxic to your cancer cells, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=988.4s)]
*  but it's also going to be toxic to normal healthy cells, which is where you get, you know, toxicity [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=994.64s)]
*  and safety challenges. And that those are the things that really start to, you know, debilitate, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=999.52s)]
*  you know, patients' lives and their quality of life and impact their day to day. The idea here is [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1004.56s)]
*  to understand at the root, what is causing your cancer and figuring out if we can tailor a [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1010.1600000000001s)]
*  therapeutic to that, you know, that's going to result in, you know, anti tumor efficacy, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1018.4000000000001s)]
*  but also have a much more favorable safety profile, which will lead to improved quality [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1024.8s)]
*  of life for that patient. Yeah. Yeah. We've, I've talked about it before on this show, my, you know, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1028.96s)]
*  my dad has suffered some, some health problems of late the last couple of years. He's had, in fact, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1036.08s)]
*  bladder cancer. And we went the same route, you know, local oncologists for a little while before [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1042.32s)]
*  I convinced them to seek specialized care, again, drawing some connections down in Pittsburgh, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1047.12s)]
*  a couple of hours of where we live. Shout out to Dr. Benjamin Davies once again, for his excellent [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1051.52s)]
*  work down there. But to your point, I mean, these are the things that, you know, we're, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1056.8s)]
*  we're responsible for doing, seeking the best care for the conditions that we have now as it [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1060.24s)]
*  relates to genomic testing. What's, what advances are driving what you guys are doing as far as [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1067.1200000000001s)]
*  biological therapy development is concerned, what advances in genomic testing and accessibility to [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1073.92s)]
*  that is kind of an enabling factor in that. Yeah. Yeah. I know the field of technology [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1080.4s)]
*  and genomic testing has moved forward quite a bit. I think, you know, people just even use the [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1087.04s)]
*  term genomic testing as a standard term that I feel like everyone should understand, right? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1093.44s)]
*  You know, genomic testing can mean a variety of things. There's different types of genomic testing. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1099.6s)]
*  You know, all of these things are important to also understand because not all genomic testing [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1106.32s)]
*  is created equal. You know, for the lead target that we're taking a look at as it relates to NRG1, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1112.64s)]
*  you know, this genomic alteration is, it's a fusion protein. You basically have one protein [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1121.76s)]
*  fused with another protein. And, you know, not to go too deep into the science, but, you know, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1127.68s)]
*  these are very large proteins which, you know, pose limitations for, you know, certain types of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1134.16s)]
*  genomic sequencing that make them tough to find. So currently the vast majority of genomic testing [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1139.84s)]
*  companies are using what's called DNA-based, you know, next generation sequencing techniques, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1146.48s)]
*  which, you know, for picking up oncogenic fusion proteins like NRG1 are not the optimal test to [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1152.9599999999998s)]
*  utilize. They carry about a 33% sensitivity, so they can detect these fusion proteins, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1161.36s)]
*  but it's at a very low sensitivity and they actually miss two out of every three. So they're [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1168.88s)]
*  only capturing 33%. If you're looking for an oncogenic fusion protein like NRG1, you actually [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1174.0800000000002s)]
*  need to utilize RNA-based NGS testing, which has a much higher sensitivity for picking up these [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1182.96s)]
*  larger protein regions or these large intronic regions, you know, where they carry north of a [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1190.5600000000002s)]
*  90% sensitivity. So you're actually capturing nine out of every 10. You're only missing one out of [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1196.72s)]
*  every 10. So, I mean, you can even see with this, you know, movement away from DNA-based NGS testing [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1201.28s)]
*  to RNA-based NGS testing, there's a dramatic increase in sensitivity. And, you know, that's, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1208.8s)]
*  you know, an additional eight patients that you can identify with RNA-based NGS, whereas if you're [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1216.16s)]
*  using DNA-based NGS, you're missing two out of every three of those patients. So, you know, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1222.64s)]
*  I think it's not only important to get your tumor sequenced, but it's also important to make sure [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1227.2s)]
*  that you're talking to your doctor about what are my options for genomic testing and understanding [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1234.3200000000002s)]
*  based upon those options, which one is the most sensitive for picking up a variety of different [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1241.2s)]
*  genomic alterations. The business of Biotech is brought to you in partnership with Cytiva. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1246.8s)]

*  Yeah, from the, this is a source of, I guess, internal conflict for me from a business of biotech [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1288.88s)]
*  standpoint around precision medicine and the limitations of the market that you're addressing. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1295.84s)]
*  Like there's an inherent conflict there, am I right? Like from a business perspective, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1304.48s)]
*  you go out and you're looking for financing, for instance, you're looking for investments. Well, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1309.52s)]
*  what do you do? We create precision medicine. Ooh, that sounds sexy. You know, what's that all about? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1313.84s)]
*  Well, we identify a very finite percent of the population suffering from a very rare disease. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1318.3999999999999s)]
*  We intend to address that and make them feel better. Well, there's an inherent market [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1324.08s)]
*  limitation there. So how do you go about reconciling that with, I guess, the formation [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1329.9199999999998s)]
*  and go forward plan of your business? Yeah, so I think you just have to be more creative with [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1334.32s)]
*  how you develop the drugs. You need to do that in order to have a similar return on investment. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1340.32s)]
*  You need to think about doing drug development differently. You can't just do [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1348.1599999999999s)]
*  drug development the same way that every other company has done drug development in the past. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1352.8000000000002s)]
*  You need to pay close attention to changes in the regulatory landscape and environment to understand [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1358.4s)]
*  how is the FDA and other regulatory agencies contributing to more expedited development [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1365.0400000000002s)]
*  paths and strategy to being able to cater to even rare genomically defined patient population. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1372.72s)]
*  So whether that's in the past, when you think about oncology drug development, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1379.2s)]
*  it's very simple. You develop a drug and a very broad patient population. And in order to get that [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1385.44s)]
*  drug registered, you typically develop it in one type of cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1392.0s)]
*  cancer. That's the development path to registration. I think in order to make something commercially [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1399.52s)]
*  attractive or attractive from a business standpoint in a rare genomically defined [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1408.16s)]
*  patient population, you have to be creative. You have to partner and collaborate with [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1412.72s)]
*  diagnostic companies to find these patients. This notion of being able to just do it by yourself [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1419.2s)]
*  is not the way forward. It's not the way that we're going to advance precision medicine. So it's [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1426.64s)]
*  all about partnership and collaboration. It's partnership and collaboration with diagnostic [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1432.72s)]
*  companies and pharmaceutical and biotech companies. It's collaboration with patient [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1437.44s)]
*  advocacy groups that know where these patients are. They seem to come out of the woodwork. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1441.6000000000001s)]
*  It's crazy how these things all transpire. And it's also being creative around the drug [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1448.0800000000002s)]
*  development strategy. Just developing in one type of cancer may not be a profitable path forward. But [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1456.48s)]
*  if I can develop in all types of cancer and do one clinical trial in a tumor agnostic development [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1465.44s)]
*  strategy because I'm selecting just the patients with the genomically defined alteration, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1474.3200000000002s)]
*  then I can run one clinical trial and I can get a broad indication with regulatory agencies [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1481.68s)]
*  to where I'm just running one clinical trial rather than running one clinical trial and [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1488.4s)]
*  specific tumor type to get it approved in all patients. So I think again, it's partnership [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1495.28s)]
*  collaboration. It's being creative with your development strategy to do things in a time and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1502.8s)]
*  a cost efficient manner. Yeah. Development and clinical strategy. So the clinical strategy, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1508.4s)]
*  is that something that's pretty novel? Yeah. There's now four FDA approved therapies that have [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1514.4s)]
*  pursued tumor agnostic development strategies in genomically defined patient populations. So I think [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1522.88s)]
*  it's fairly cutting edge, but it's not like you're setting a new precedent and you're the first [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1530.48s)]
*  company out there doing this. There is a clear regulatory precedence now for this tumor agnostic [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1536.64s)]
*  development strategy where you run essentially one clinical trial in this genomically defined [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  patient population across all different types of cancer, as opposed to selecting all patients [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1549.76s)]
*  with one type of cancer. Yeah. Yeah. That's fascinating. You mentioned a few minutes ago [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1556.64s)]
*  about the folly and attempting to go it alone, the need for partnership. And from what I understand, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1563.44s)]
*  you guys are working with a number of diagnostic partners, nine diagnostic collaborators, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1568.24s)]
*  if that counts still. So tell us about that. What's that network look like and what are they doing [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1573.76s)]
*  for you? Yeah. So we do have the nine diagnostic partnerships that are in place. The way that this [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1578.96s)]
*  works is some of the partnerships that we have in place with diagnostic companies, they are just [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1586.72s)]
*  doing their standard kind of genomic testing. And basically if they identify a patient with [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1592.88s)]
*  a genomic alteration of therapeutic interest to elevation, basically what they do is they notify [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1599.68s)]
*  us. They notify the treating oncologist that there's a potential clinical trial option that's [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1607.12s)]
*  available for their patient. And then we work collaboratively with that treating medical [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1613.1999999999998s)]
*  oncologist to find the nearest clinical trial site for that patient. The aspect of the diagnostic [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1619.1999999999998s)]
*  partnerships that I think is even more intriguing than that medical oncologist referring a patient [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1626.9599999999998s)]
*  out to a clinical trial site is for that medical oncologist to be able to keep their patient [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1633.36s)]
*  and actually open up an elevation oncology clinical trial at their site. So there are [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1640.8799999999999s)]
*  three partnerships that we have in place that are what they're called just in time clinical [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1647.6s)]
*  trial collaboration. So the way that that works is rather than following the traditional clinical [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1654.48s)]
*  research organization or CRO based model where the CRO selects a number of clinical trial sites [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1662.16s)]
*  across the country. You put in contracts, you get regulatory approvals with all of those sites [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1669.6000000000001s)]
*  and you just run your clinical trial at those sites. What we've done is through three of these [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1676.8000000000002s)]
*  diagnostic partnerships, we have access to 400 plus clinical trial sites across the country. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1682.3200000000002s)]
*  The way that those work is we pre-negotiated contract, we pre-negotiated budget, the study's [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1688.96s)]
*  approved through a central institutional review board or IRB and that gets all the operational [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1694.72s)]
*  minutiae out of the way ahead of time. What we can do in those scenarios with those 400 plus [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1701.92s)]
*  clinical trial sites through three of the diagnostic partnerships that we have in place [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1708.32s)]
*  is F and when the patient is identified by any of those three diagnostic partnerships, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1713.2800000000002s)]
*  they are immediately notified that there's a clinical trial option for their patient. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1719.92s)]
*  Given the fact that we've gotten all the operational minutiae out of the way, we can [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1724.24s)]
*  activate that clinical trial site within 14 days or less. That allows the doctor to keep their [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1729.5200000000002s)]
*  patient. They don't have to refer the patient out. I mean most medical oncologists would prefer to [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1735.44s)]
*  keep their patient. They don't want to refer them out to the nearest academic center or [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1740.24s)]
*  another community oncology practice, whatever it may be. It's a win-win for everyone around the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1745.36s)]
*  table. It allows us to activate those sites in 14 days or less. It allows the patient to get on a [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1750.96s)]
*  clinical trial that's tailored to their genomic alteration. It allows that doctor to keep their [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1757.84s)]
*  patient, which allows for continuity with that patient. With us having 400 plus clinical trial [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1762.96s)]
*  sites across the U.S., it's also very patient-friendly because it allows them to find [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1769.2s)]
*  a clinical trial site that's most likely pretty close to where they live, which we believe results [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1774.56s)]
*  in improved quality of life. It allows you to spend more time with family, friends, etc. in a [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1782.16s)]
*  very difficult and challenging time in your life. Yeah, that's pretty wild. Where does that model [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1787.68s)]
*  come from? Where's the foundation of that model? Yeah, so I really had no idea that this model was [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1794.4s)]
*  in place. When I was working at Area Pharmaceuticals, we were doing precision medicine there. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1802.96s)]
*  We had kind of toyed with some of these ideas. We had talked about some of these things, but [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1810.64s)]
*  it was very challenging to implement at that time. I mean diagnostic companies are not what they are [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1815.2s)]
*  today. The innovation associated with medicine wasn't where we needed it to be. As the field of [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1821.12s)]
*  genomic testing has evolved and moved forward, people have made this a reality. They've realized [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1829.12s)]
*  that you can't use that traditional CRO-based clinical trial model to cater to rare genomically [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1837.1999999999998s)]
*  defined patient populations. If you did, you could do it, but it's going to take you forever [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1846.16s)]
*  to enroll a clinical trial. It's going to cost you a lot of money because you're going to end up opening [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1852.0800000000002s)]
*  a ton of clinical trial sites because you're trying to find a needle in a haystack. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1858.16s)]
*  You're going to be carrying clinical trial site overhead for each and every one of those sites. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1862.64s)]
*  Whether they do or don't find a patient, that's not capital efficient. I only want to pay sites [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1867.76s)]
*  if you're going to find patients. If you're not going to find patients, why do I want to carry [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1873.28s)]
*  site overhead associated with that? Which is where this just-in-time clinical trial model comes into [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1877.2s)]
*  play because the only time that you end up carrying site overhead for a site is when they identify a [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1883.28s)]
*  patient and you decide to activate that in that kind of 14-day or less period and you have the [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1891.44s)]
*  just-in-time activation. It's great. I activate your site when I know you have a patient. We don't [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1896.96s)]
*  have to activate a site unless you actually have a patient. That's capital efficient. That's time [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1902.32s)]
*  efficient. We dropped an episode a few weeks ago with Alan Shaw on the clinical trials conundrum, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1907.52s)]
*  waxing philosophical about everything that's wrong with the clinical trials paradigm today. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1918.1599999999999s)]
*  So this is innovative. Innovation is also scary, sometimes clunky, sometimes challenging. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1925.04s)]
*  As you embrace that approach, what sort of regulatory challenges, skepticism, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1935.84s)]
*  kind of blocking the status quo and doing something different as clinical trials go, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1946.56s)]
*  what sort of challenges did you face? Yeah, I mean, I think especially when you have [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1951.92s)]
*  nine diagnostic partnerships in place, you're working with a variety of different companies [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1956.8799999999999s)]
*  and each one of these companies have a different way in terms of how they want to do things as [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1961.6s)]
*  well. Each company, they know what the rules are that they follow, but there are also certain [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1968.56s)]
*  companies that are much more conservative than others. There are legal groups that are like, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1976.4s)]
*  you can do this, but we wouldn't recommend that you do this or you can do it, but you have to [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1982.72s)]
*  stay within these guardrails. So there's a certain area of what's finite and then also a gray zone [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1990.72s)]
*  where you can operate in as it relates to innovation. So I think you have to be very careful [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=1998.0s)]
*  with these things. You obviously have to follow regulatory and compliance guidelines, but we also [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2006.16s)]
*  need to make sure that there's room for innovation here. So I think we've kind of realized some of [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2012.5600000000002s)]
*  the pros and cons to working and I think we're working collaboratively with these diagnostic [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2020.48s)]
*  companies to try to figure out a compliant from both the regulatory and from a quality standpoint [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2026.72s)]
*  to make sure that we're able to bring innovation to these patients. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2034.48s)]
*  Yeah. Following this model, I mean the very model of the company addressing the genomic [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2038.3200000000002s)]
*  alteration as opposed to specific indications, does that open up your patient recruitment [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2043.8400000000001s)]
*  opportunities? Does it actually relieve a burden as far as clinical recruitment is concerned? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2050.88s)]
*  Or does it make it more, I mean, I imagine it makes it more complex as well in a way. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2056.4s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it makes it more complex because you need more operational infrastructure to [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2060.88s)]
*  manage these partnerships. So that's the added complexity component. But I mean, I can tell you [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2065.6s)]
*  that it's a way more efficient model. I mean, there's way more diagnostic companies looking [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2072.0s)]
*  for these patients. Without the test, you don't identify these patients. It's not like you're [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2079.6800000000003s)]
*  treating an all comers. If you don't have the genomic testing results, you can't identify [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2087.36s)]
*  these patients. They go hand in hand. So the diagnostic companies and partnering with them [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2094.6400000000003s)]
*  are key to identify these patients and also to just like the greater precision medicine ecosystem. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2100.0s)]
*  Yeah. How does the genomic testing aspect of your approach [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2107.28s)]
*  impact the manufacturing approach? So, and I asked that question because I mean, again, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2115.2000000000003s)]
*  it seems inherent that, you know, if you're looking at precision approaches to very, very specific [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2123.0400000000004s)]
*  indications based on genomic markers, you're looking at a lot of complexity in your manufacturing [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2128.96s)]
*  approach because it's not, you know, hit the button and let it roll, right? It's not a [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2135.68s)]
*  great big giant run of generic therapeutics. So how does that look in your business? Like, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2140.3999999999996s)]
*  as you approach, you know, scale up as you need more supply for clinical trials, as you move into [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2149.2799999999997s)]
*  in a commercial, how does your approach impact your manufacturing scheme? Yeah. So Matt, I think [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2156.16s)]
*  you're maybe asking two questions, one of which is on the, I use a lot of words when I ask questions, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2163.04s)]
*  so there could be four questions in there. I don't know. Reflect on my poorly worded question. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2167.84s)]
*  I'm going to break it down into two paths, one of which is the manufacturing path and the relevance [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2174.0s)]
*  on the manufacturing side. And then also, you know, kind of like what needs to be done from [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2180.88s)]
*  a companion diagnostic development, which is more so kind of like the analytical side and really [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2186.4s)]
*  kind of like what regulatory agency is like the FDA want to see in terms of, you know, when and if [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2192.24s)]
*  you get a drug commercially approved, how are you going to identify these patients? Because you need [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2198.3199999999997s)]
*  to have a commercially approved companion diagnostic or CDX to identify these patients in addition to [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2203.8399999999997s)]
*  also getting the drug, you know, commercially approved and approved from a regulatory standpoint. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2210.56s)]
*  So I think that's also kind of a key component here. You know, I think on the manufacturing side, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2215.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, it's very different from elevation for elevation than I would say it is for other [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2221.6800000000003s)]
*  companies, right? Because, you know, I think when you think of most pharmaceutical biotech companies, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2226.56s)]
*  you know, they typically have a drug discovery research phase before they go into the clinic and [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2232.08s)]
*  do development, right? We jumped, you know, straight into development. So we went from [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2237.28s)]
*  company formation to initiation of a phase two study with potential registrational intent [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2242.88s)]
*  via an accelerated approval pathway and 12 months time. You know, a big part of the reason why we [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2248.48s)]
*  were able to do that is, you know, we were able to acquire a product, you know, from another [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2254.32s)]
*  pharmaceutical company where they had developed that product in, you know, over 800 patients. It [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2260.16s)]
*  just wasn't developed in the right genomically defined patient population. And, you know, with [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2264.8s)]
*  that came, you know, drug substance, drug product that was, you know, GMP registration ready. And, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2271.6s)]
*  you know, we didn't have to do any manufacturing work to initiate our phase two clinical trial [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2281.68s)]
*  because we already had existing drug substance and drug product that was already registration ready [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2287.2799999999997s)]
*  GMP. And, you know, for us, you know, what we've done is, you know, given the fact that we're [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2292.72s)]
*  running a registrational trial, you know, we're using the exact same, you know, scale that we [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2298.8s)]
*  inherited from the prior company, you know, so that is kind of in this like autopilot mode that [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2305.84s)]
*  you've outlined. But we are also now in the process of looking at commercial scale up as we de-risk [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2311.92s)]
*  the program, you know, throughout its development cycle. And then also starting to look ahead to, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2319.04s)]
*  you know, how many patients are out there? What is the commercial opportunity that exists [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2325.2s)]
*  to figure out and identify what that commercial scale manufacturing looks like? So that's kind of [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2329.6s)]
*  the manufacturing component. And I think, you know, how we think about it, I think the other [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2335.04s)]
*  component here is the companion diagnostic development strategy. So, you know, when you [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2341.04s)]
*  look at the four approved tumor agnostic development strategies that were employed by, you know, other [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2346.0s)]
*  companies that have led to FDA approvals of, you know, tumor agnostic development products, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2353.6s)]
*  you know, everyone has dealt with companion diagnostic registration as a post-marketing [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2360.7999999999997s)]
*  commitment. So basically, what's happened is there are existing tests that are out there, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2366.48s)]
*  you know, they are not commercially approved tests, but they are tests that are out there [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2372.64s)]
*  and available, you know, from a research and development standpoint. So, you know, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2377.84s)]
*  those products have relied on products that are not on tests that are not FDA approved necessarily [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2383.36s)]
*  to identify these patients. And then as part of the post-marketing commitment with regulatory [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  agencies like the FDA, they've then registered that companion diagnostic or test, which is specific [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2396.88s)]
*  to their therapeutic, you know, post the approval of the therapeutic itself. So we are, you know, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2402.48s)]
*  trying to work collaboratively with diagnostic companies again to accelerate kind of drug [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2410.16s)]
*  development and diagnostic development to, you know, register companion diagnostic simultaneously [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2415.52s)]
*  with the approval of the therapeutic. But again, if we're not able to do that, there's a clear [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2421.92s)]
*  regulatory precedence that we could do that as a post-marketing commitment as well. So I think, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2426.88s)]
*  you know, the FDA and other regulatory agencies, you know, understand that in a development of [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2431.92s)]
*  precision oncology products can be done in a much more expedited manner. And they also understand [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2438.0s)]
*  that you might not be able to cram everything you ideally want into that finite period of time. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2443.76s)]
*  So they also will work collaboratively for you to do things that they believe are necessary to help [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2449.6800000000003s)]
*  identify these patients and address them as a post-marketing commitment, which again, like, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2454.64s)]
*  it's really focused on in order to take precision medicine to the next level, it takes partnership, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2459.7599999999998s)]
*  collaboration, et cetera. Yeah. You know, you come off as a very cool, you know, very chill, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2465.6s)]
*  relaxed guy, but you're a disruptor, man. You're a disruptor. Do you consider Elevation a disruptive [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2474.72s)]
*  company? Yeah. I don't know if I would necessarily consider Elevation a disruptive company. I mean, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2482.24s)]
*  you know, I think we're really just looking to move the field forward, right? I mean, I think [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2489.52s)]
*  we are looking to not necessarily disrupt the field, but, you know, really elevate the field [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2495.04s)]
*  of precision medicine and precision oncology. I think, you know, we want to get people to be [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2501.2s)]
*  more creative and think about doing things differently. You know, I think some would [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2508.0s)]
*  view that as disruptive, but I think all too often, you know, we all want to... [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2513.84s)]
*  With a positive connotation, Mike. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what's next? I mean, you know, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2520.4s)]
*  as you were describing the therapeutic itself and the fact that it already sort of moved through [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2530.5600000000004s)]
*  the development process, you know, I mean, I don't know what the right adjective would be [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2538.72s)]
*  to describe that fortuitous, perhaps, you know, fortunate, we'll say, I don't want to say lucky, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2544.08s)]
*  but, you know, you're a little bit ahead of the game with that. What's next? I mean, what do you [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2552.16s)]
*  do beyond? What are you looking at beyond that? Yeah. So, I mean, we're, you know, I think you've [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2557.2799999999997s)]
*  gotten this vibe. I mean, like we're looking to, you know, generate an industry-leading precision [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2561.9199999999996s)]
*  oncology company at elevation. You know, we're not looking to just, you know, cater to one [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2566.96s)]
*  genomically defined patient population. We're looking to make, you know, precision oncology [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2573.04s)]
*  therapeutics available to a variety of different genomic alterations. And, you know, I think a lot [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2577.84s)]
*  of companies, again, like to get caught up in this, well, we're an antibody company or we're a small [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2584.6400000000003s)]
*  molecule company or we're an antibody drug conjugate company. I mean, we believe that depending upon [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2589.6s)]
*  the different genomic alterations that exist, you know, you may have to work and get comfortable with [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2596.0s)]
*  a variety of different therapeutic modalities. So, you know, we're looking to develop a very, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2603.12s)]
*  you know, broad expertise to be able to cater to, you know, a variety of different [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2608.24s)]
*  genomic alterations, being able to deliver therapeutic modalities that are optimal for [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2612.7999999999997s)]
*  those different types of genomic alterations. So, you know, what we've done that is we've created, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2618.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, essentially three strategic pillars in terms of how we plan and intend to grow the company, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2623.44s)]
*  you know, the first of which is focused on maximizing the value of our lead program, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2628.7200000000003s)]
*  which is Saravansimab. So, you know, that's not only just development in NRG1 gene fusions where [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2633.68s)]
*  we're running our phase two study with potential registrational intent, but also expanding and [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2640.56s)]
*  being able to bring Saravansimab to other genomically defined patient populations where [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2646.2400000000002s)]
*  the target HER3 is relevant. So, you know, again, we're looking to work collaboratively with, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2652.32s)]
*  you know, for instance, antibody drug conjugate companies to take Saravansimab and attach it to a [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2659.84s)]
*  linker and toxic payload to be able to deliver that toxic payload in a very targeted format, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2666.8s)]
*  for instance, to cater to patients with HER3 amplified and overexpressed cancer. So, that's [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2674.56s)]
*  some work that we, you know, we recently started working on. The second strategic pillar is really [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2680.96s)]
*  focused on a partnership and collaboration we put in place right before IPO financing. This is a [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2687.52s)]
*  strategic collaboration with a next generation sequencing company called Keras Life Sciences. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2693.68s)]
*  You know, we partnered with Keras around identification and target discovery associated [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2700.48s)]
*  with oncogenic fusion and driver mutation targets. So, again, genomically defined targets. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2707.36s)]
*  You know, Keras is a leader in the next generation sequencing space and in genomic testing [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2713.52s)]
*  where they do whole transcriptome and whole exome sequencing. So, when you think about most [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2720.56s)]
*  diagnostic companies, you know, they're typically running a gene panel on, you know, their favorite [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2725.36s)]
*  three to roughly 600 genes. And, you know, with Keras doing whole transcriptome and whole exome [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2730.8s)]
*  sequencing, they're sequencing the entire genome. So, they're getting access and data analytics on [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2736.56s)]
*  all 22,000 genes. That's a lot of data, even just on one patient. And, I mean, Keras has sequenced, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2742.24s)]
*  you know, over 100,000 patients to date. So, that's a very, very large data set. And, you know, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2749.2799999999997s)]
*  the hypothesis going into that partnership was, okay, well, if most diagnostic companies are just [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2756.16s)]
*  doing three to 600 gene panels, Keras is doing all 22,000 genes, they probably identified some [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2762.24s)]
*  targets that others have not identified. You know, I think, you know, now that we have this [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2767.8399999999997s)]
*  partnership in place, you know, we know that there's some very interesting and very unique targets. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2772.3199999999997s)]
*  So, you know, basically what we're doing with that partnership is we're now taking those targets, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2777.7599999999998s)]
*  going through and prioritizing those targets, figuring out which targets are amenable to [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2782.3999999999996s)]
*  existing therapeutics we could license or acquire and accelerate drug development like we did with [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2788.24s)]
*  serivantimab and energy infusions. We're also going through simultaneously and prioritizing [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2792.72s)]
*  targets to take into novel drug discovery campaigns where you would start the whole [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2800.3999999999996s)]
*  drug discovery process from scratch. So, that's kind of the second pillar. And then the third [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2805.9199999999996s)]
*  pillar is, you know, really focused on business development efforts, so traditional licensing, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2811.7599999999998s)]
*  merger acquisition stuff, kind of like leveraging my knowledge and expertise on the business [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2817.2000000000003s)]
*  development side as well as kind of the business development team that we put in place at elevation [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2824.1600000000003s)]
*  to look at other precision oncology targets and look to license or acquire products that would [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2829.2000000000003s)]
*  allow us to accelerate drug development against those targets. Yeah, well, that ought to keep you [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2834.7200000000003s)]
*  busy. Yeah, it definitely keeps us busy for sure. As I said from the outside of the conversation, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2841.6s)]
*  your background and experience certainly contribute or lend themselves to those three [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2848.72s)]
*  pillars and your continued success. I'm super impressed. I mean, you know, if it weren't [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2855.7599999999998s)]
*  morally objectionable, I'd be buying your stock right now. I mean, you instill confidence and I [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2861.2799999999997s)]
*  think, you know, the progress, the innovation, it's super inspiring and awesome work. And [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2869.28s)]
*  we're way over time here. I feel like we could talk about it for another hour. We'll have to [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2874.8s)]
*  have you back on for an update, Dr. Leland. Yeah, that sounds great. Yeah, Matt, obviously, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb75grmfmNk&t=2879.92s)]
