Video Description: On this, the 100th episode of the Business of Biotech podcast, our dear friend, frequent guest, and business of biotech brainiac Allan Shaw joins us to dissect the beleaguered biotech capital markets. We pick apart what's driving sentiment and how we got here, whether the industry is over-inventoried, what's getting funded , what's not, and why, and what biotech leaders should be doing in an investment landscape marked by hyper-discernment. We also reflect on the podcast journey and celebrate the 100-episode milestone!

# The Biotech Beatdown With Allan Shaw
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [June 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw)
*  Welcome back to the business of biotech. I'm Matt Piller and I'm here in the LifeScience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=0.0s)]
*  Connect studios with none other than the beast of the biotech budget, the ruler of the cash [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=8.16s)]
*  runway, the maven of the capital markets, my friend Alan Shaw. Alan, how you doing? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=15.6s)]
*  I'm doing well. Thank you for that windup. I feel like I should be saying something as [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=22.96s)]
*  equally complimentary back. There's nothing to say. You know, we're marking a milestone today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=28.72s)]
*  Alan, do you know what the milestone is today? I've heard through the grapevine that it's the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=36.24s)]
*  100th episode of the business of biotech. 100 episodes. Yeah, crazy, isn't it? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=42.4s)]
*  Where has the time gone? And congratulations, you know, given that we're always focused on [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=49.92s)]
*  milestones. It's really nice to have a positive one. I don't know if you'll trade up today, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=56.4s)]
*  but it's great. Yeah, well, I hope so. I hope our numbers trade up. And I got to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  applaud your segue there because we're going to talk about trading up and trading down as it were [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=72.0s)]
*  in today's discussion. But before we get into it, I got to thank you. I mean, I have to thank you, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=78.96s)]
*  when I reflect for a minute on this podcast, I started this thing two years ago. It was just [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  over two years ago when this episode drops. And it was just sort of an experiment, you know, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=90.96s)]
*  it was an experiment because I was brand new to the space. And I knew that the best way for me to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  learn this space was to spend time talking with people who are innovating in this space, new and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  emerging biopharma leaders who are innovating in the space. And then we thought, you know what, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=107.35999999999999s)]
*  if I'm going to do that, and ask those people questions, there's probably a big universe of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=112.0s)]
*  people out there who would be interested in coming along for the ride. So why not? Why not [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=117.76s)]
*  put it in podcast form? So we said, you know what, let's do this, right? Like fearlessly, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=122.0s)]
*  let's just go do this. Let people listen in on Matt's inquisition, sometimes naive and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=126.8s)]
*  uninformed inquisition of people who have been in the space for a long time. And Alan, you know, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=134.0s)]
*  you were my first, very first guest. You helped me kick this thing off. You've been on the show [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=138.96s)]
*  12 times now. Subsequently, I know at one point we talked about like, hey, let's do this monthly. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=144.96s)]
*  And then, man, the runway just gets long. We get, you know, just jammed up with guests. But I've [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=150.16s)]
*  managed to get you to come back and spend time with me 12 times now. You know, I just want to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  thank you. I mean, your episodes. Look, I like you. The audience likes you. And you're really [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=162.8s)]
*  good for ratings. So thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. And I'm going to certainly [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=168.72s)]
*  share that little bit with my mom. I think that'll certainly make her day. So thank you for that as [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=177.68s)]
*  well. It's been fun, you know, and we embarked on this, you know, as you said, it was an experiment. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  And I've been really, I've enjoyed the collegial nature of the activities and being part of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  journey that you've embarked on and look forward to continuing the ride. Yeah, well, good. I'll [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  send you a snapshot of the stats that you can prove to your mother that this is, you know, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=201.68s)]
*  you've made a name for yourself among the audience. I appreciate that. It's funny. I tell my family, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=207.52s)]
*  you guys may not want to listen to me, but apparently other people do. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=213.52s)]
*  They do. They do. They tune in. Yeah. And part of, you know, part of the reason they tune in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=216.64s)]
*  specifically to Alan Shaw episodes is because you've got, you know, a lengthy and a unique [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  perspective on the space. And, you know, just kind of move into this conversation that we're [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=229.04s)]
*  going to have today. Since we launched two years ago, you know, the roller coaster ride that is the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=234.16s)]
*  biotech space. It's been a wild one for me being new to it a couple of years ago and now kind of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=242.16s)]
*  seeing the ups and the downs, you know, the, just the wild ride that we've seen, particularly in the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=248.48s)]
*  last 12 months, makes me curious not having historical perspective. It makes me curious [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=254.72s)]
*  about yours, your perspective on what's going on on this wild ride over the past 12, 18, 24 months. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=261.04s)]
*  If you want to go back to when times were, you know, good and we were flying high, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=268.56s)]
*  how does that kind of relate to the 20 plus years prior that you've spent in the space? What kind [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  of cycles like this have you seen before? Give us some kind of historical perspective. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=279.04s)]
*  You know, it's interesting when you reflect on these things, you know, it's like platform shoes, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=285.76s)]
*  you know, things go in and out of season and it's certainly very cyclical and we've certainly had a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=291.68s)]
*  prolific cycle, you know, almost like the economy, you know, we've had a really wonderful [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=298.08s)]
*  decade as an industry and as we've referenced in the past, if you go back prior to that, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, it was Death Valley, you know, you couldn't do deals at all and there's been a [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=311.44s)]
*  lot written about what needed to be done in order to sponsor that and the people's memories are [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=316.88s)]
*  short and, you know, I would say, you know, if you look over more recent times, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=323.44s)]
*  you know, it's kind of feels like the good, the bad and the ugly. We've certainly had and continue [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=329.52s)]
*  to have, I'd say, the golden age of biotech, you know, I think, you know, we're on the precipice [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=336.4s)]
*  of incredible innovation and I still think we're scratching the surface with where we can go [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=341.84s)]
*  and what we can do in terms of impacting patients, in terms of our medical needs [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=349.44s)]
*  and making significant step improvements over what the current standard of care is these days. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=355.04s)]
*  So I think that part of it is great and I think there's still general interest and a lot of money [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=363.36s)]
*  for that. But I think like a lot of things, I think as a society, we always seem to do things [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=368.4s)]
*  to the excess and then until we break it and I think, you know, what we're seeing right now [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=374.96s)]
*  isn't just a byproduct of that. The pendulum, you know, as a good friend of mine has said and I may [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=382.0s)]
*  have even spoke this before, but the pendulum never stops in the middle and, you know, we've had good [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=387.68s)]
*  times, now we're now into bad times and it's probably needed, you know, it's like medicine [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=393.12s)]
*  sometimes, it doesn't taste so good, but for us to, for this to function right, you know, you need [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=399.04s)]
*  to kind of weed yourself off of some of the excessiveness of that and when you step back, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=406.8s)]
*  money was free and because of that, that fueled us and it fueled the proliferation and the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=412.56s)]
*  excessiveness and now I guess we're going on a diet, you know, or it's the hangover after the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=419.76s)]
*  party if you want to think of it that way. Yeah, yeah, yeah and when we talk about this con, you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=425.12s)]
*  know, this idea of the sentiment towards the biotech industry, you know, you shared some [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=431.76s)]
*  data with me recently that kind of charts the decline in biotech sentiment and that word is [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=437.76s)]
*  the word used in the report over the last year and I want to try to put some hands around that, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=443.12s)]
*  you know, try to put some fingers around that and understand what the drivers of biotech [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=448.8s)]
*  sentiment are and what they mean. So how do, you know, how do analysts measure sentiment in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=453.28s)]
*  this industry? What are the, I guess, hallmarks of general sentiment toward the biotech industry? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=459.2s)]
*  Well, I think you can go a lot of different places and I think there's a lot of different [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=466.08s)]
*  drivers of sentiment. I think if you take this a step back, it's money, right? It's the flow of money [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=470.56s)]
*  and right now there aren't buyers. So, you know, as a leading metric, we're seeing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=479.2s)]
*  really the top, you know, if you use an analogy, you know, this tide was high, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=488.08s)]
*  now the tide is low and the tide is going up and the flow of funds are going out and there's just [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=492.72s)]
*  less people interested in biotech and life science in general and I think you've seen that as a [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=498.16s)]
*  rotation in assets and it's driven by macro events as well. But I also think that, you know, things [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=505.52s)]
*  that we as an industry can control, we can't control some of the macro, right? We can't [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=516.4s)]
*  control Ukraine, we can't control interest rates, which I think is actually much more fundamental. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=520.48s)]
*  They've effectively doubled since the beginning of the year and, you know, as I've often said before, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=526.48s)]
*  interest rates are, is the canary in the coal mine, you know, once those things start to go up, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  people can get returns with less risk and so there's a mentality on risk and when you think [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=538.88s)]
*  about risk, we already have an industry that has an incredible level of attrition, failure, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=544.64s)]
*  from a get-go and when you start to see things that kind of suggest an increase [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=553.84s)]
*  in those industrial jeopardies, albeit regulatory, where the FDA is certainly, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=561.28s)]
*  seems to be becoming a little sterner, even recent action right now in terms of kind of enforcing [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=570.64s)]
*  and putting more teeth and hurdles in terms of accelerated approvals, I think are, you know, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=578.08s)]
*  exhibits of that type of environment but I think, you know, further to that, you know, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=586.24s)]
*  I think we're also seeing a lot of negative sentiment being generated just based on the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=591.36s)]
*  industry's execution and that's manifesting itself in what I would say a much higher level [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=597.2s)]
*  of negative trial data. Yeah, I want to back up to something you mentioned around [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  macro events that's going to, and I was going to save this question for later but I'm going to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=611.5200000000001s)]
*  ask you now because you brought up the macro event, I guess, effect and yeah, to your point, like [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=615.12s)]
*  Ukraine, interest rates, like things that are certainly out of our control but there was a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=622.24s)]
*  macro event two years ago that on the heels of that macro event, biopharma industry was [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=627.12s)]
*  God, we were the heroes, right, like we made miracles happen, global miracles in response [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=635.84s)]
*  to the pandemic. What happened to that? Why, you know, how, you know, everybody was like, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=644.56s)]
*  you know, everybody acknowledged that this was a shining moment for, you know, if you take the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=650.0s)]
*  greater pharmaceutical industry as a whole into account, it was a shining moment for an industry [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=654.88s)]
*  that's on many fronts loathed by the public. So what happened to that as a catalyst to, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=660.48s)]
*  you know, to good times, to sunshine and roses? You know, I guess it hits the whole cliche of [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=669.52s)]
*  buy on the rumor, sell on the news. You know, I think we kind of all benefited during that [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=678.48s)]
*  period of time leading to the pinnacle of the vaccine. You know, I think in that look at [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=684.8s)]
*  Moderna stock, it certainly took the ride. Still not a much better place than it ever's been, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=690.4s)]
*  but it certainly, it was a ride. So I think some of it was simple asset allocation, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  Part of it is, you know, as we said earlier, you know, people's memories are generally pretty short [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  and also it's kind of in that spirit and vein, what have you done for me lately? And, you know, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=710.8s)]
*  right now, when you start looking at, I would call it self-inflicted wounds and injuries and that's, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=719.76s)]
*  you know, our execution, you know, why are the studies being negative? And I think the dynamics [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=726.88s)]
*  have created a further set of dominoes so that even when there's good news, you know, people are [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=734.48s)]
*  using that as an opportunity to sell. They're saying, you know, this is, it's so hard to sell, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=741.68s)]
*  they're so limited buyers that if I'm going to sell myself out of a position, I need to do it [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=746.88s)]
*  on a day that there's volume. So when a day somebody puts out good news, there's buyers, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=752.4s)]
*  but there's corresponding sellers that kind of stifle it out. So the reaction is very muted. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=758.24s)]
*  And then that becomes very frustrating for companies because, and again, going back to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=764.8s)]
*  something we said earlier, that they're still not necessarily attuned with where they are in terms of [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=770.72s)]
*  the valuation perspective. Everyone thinks that, you know, I'm going to run my gas tank down, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=776.64s)]
*  I'm going to be able to turn over cards and then I'll be able to raise money. And then the sad [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=782.4s)]
*  reality is that they're taking unreasonable amount of risk, you know, I'm not sure if that's the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  right way to run a business. You know, you should be always maintain adequate cash flow, whether [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=791.6s)]
*  you have data coming or not, for all the obvious reasons. So, you know, I think that makes it [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=797.9200000000001s)]
*  harder because then people, you know, they're even if it's playing a risky capital strategy approach, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=806.64s)]
*  I think they're not going to even get the benefit of taking that ill-conceived risk, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=815.0400000000001s)]
*  because at the end of the day, they're going to wind up issuing stock at levels that they [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=820.96s)]
*  previously wish they didn't have to. Yeah. Yeah. I want to stick on the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  negative news events point for a minute. You mentioned, you know, that a proliferation of [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=834.4000000000001s)]
*  negative news events kind of keep things tamped down. If you step back and look at the volume of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=840.48s)]
*  negative news events and what and first, I guess I'd clarify by negative news events, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=848.72s)]
*  we're talking and help me add to this list negative data readouts, right? Like bad data [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=852.96s)]
*  readouts. We're talking, you know, bad news from regulatory agencies, perhaps holds and so forth. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=859.76s)]
*  What else maybe constitutes a negative news event that affects biotech sentiment? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=867.84s)]
*  And I think you have captured the essence of negative news. It's really, you know, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=873.2s)]
*  clinical setback and that could be, you know, efficacy, safety, the FDA putting a clinical hold [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=881.28s)]
*  on, that could be manufacturing issues as well. This can be a whole lots of reasons, but I think [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=889.84s)]
*  he nailed it. What, so if you look at this, if you, let's say that for, you know, for the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=896.24s)]
*  sake of this conversation, we're going to acknowledge that there's a trend, like that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=903.04s)]
*  we're noticing a trend that there seems to be more negative news and you step back and you look at it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=906.72s)]
*  Can you put your finger on a cause, a reason? Generally, I know it's a super general question [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=913.04s)]
*  and, you know, we can't analyze every biotech that's putting news out there, but [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  do you see any general trends around what's driving negative news events? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=926.72s)]
*  I can certainly take a swag at it, right? I don't think- [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=934.88s)]
*  I don't know if it's going to hold you to it. I mean, you know. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  No, I appreciate that. You know, I think it's kind of like, oh, you know, I think you're going to, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=941.52s)]
*  if you hold people, you're going to get different perspectives from people [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=946.56s)]
*  for what my two cents are worth. I think it's a confluence of things. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  Certainly, I think it starts with the number of companies that we've had, but I think it even [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=957.8399999999999s)]
*  starts back with some of the macro things that we were seeing about the flow of money. And, you know, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=963.52s)]
*  it was so available, it was almost free in many respects. So that really, that was the fertilizer [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=968.88s)]
*  that you needed to create the companies at the end of the day. And with that, we've seen really [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=976.32s)]
*  an unbelievable proliferation as we've talked on. So I think when you have loose capital allocation, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=982.96s)]
*  coupled with what I would say brain drain, you know, you needed to populate all these companies. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=991.9200000000001s)]
*  And I don't think we necessarily had people who had seen it and done it doing these things. So I [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=998.32s)]
*  think you're increasing the risk of difficulty and execution with all of that. And I think that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1004.64s)]
*  couple poor allocation, inexperienced people, a couple of money being put to work, you got it, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1013.84s)]
*  we're giving you money to do things, right? There's pressure to spend that money, right? If you're not [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1021.04s)]
*  spending, you're not executing, you know, but, you know, if you make a wrong turn and you keep [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1028.16s)]
*  going down that road, it's still a wrong turn. So, you know, I think that will lead to what I would [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1033.52s)]
*  call poor investments, poor capital allocations that were not cost effective, which resulted in [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1039.04s)]
*  also higher burn rates too. I think one of the things that we're seeing now that adds to the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1046.96s)]
*  negative news flow, I didn't even consider it, but it's that you know, what you're hearing now is [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1052.08s)]
*  companies that are laying people off, right? They're dialing it back because they did get in front of [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  their skews way too much right now. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know, that's an interesting dilemma, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1063.12s)]
*  laying people off and you just acknowledge that, you know, there's a lot of cases out there where [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1070.0s)]
*  there's not the expertise, probably in the C-suite, but the expertise and the leadership and [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1074.3999999999999s)]
*  the veteran status that it takes to, you know, create better outcomes. And I want to ask you [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1078.7199999999998s)]
*  another question about that. Do you think, you know, I mean, you analyze in your daily work, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1084.64s)]
*  like you spend a lot of time paying attention to the science behind candidates, you know, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1093.2800000000002s)]
*  the people behind candidates, the jockeys, you like to say, that are, you know, riding those horses. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1100.0800000000002s)]
*  Do you think that generally, in any cases, in many cases, that there's good science, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1106.0s)]
*  maybe there's good, there are good candidates, there are good projects out there that may have [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1114.24s)]
*  had a better chance, may have fared better, may have avoided that clinical hold, had they been [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1118.4s)]
*  jockeyed by veteran leadership, veteran chief regulatory officers, veteran CEOs? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1125.76s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no question that we, that we would, that would help. That would be a contributing [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1134.08s)]
*  factor, right? If you tie two rocks together, you know, it may still not float, but it still, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1140.4s)]
*  right? But I would say that if you've got the right folks involved, you know, the likelihood of [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1147.8400000000001s)]
*  doing things incorrectly, making sure that you've done your preclinical work, that you've asked all [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1156.3200000000002s)]
*  the important questions before you put it into the clinic. I mean, I've seen, I've observed [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1164.16s)]
*  organizations feeling the pressure that they need to put things into a clinic. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1172.48s)]
*  And, you know, I think there's situations, and I'm not saying a lot of people are doing it, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1177.52s)]
*  but there are certainly instances of people throwing things over the wall because they need to, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1181.3600000000001s)]
*  and you have necessarily buttoned things down. I think younger companies have a tendency [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1187.6000000000001s)]
*  to be a little loose with a lot of the early preclinical IND type of stuff that you need to [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1195.6000000000001s)]
*  do to get your drug approved at the end of the day, not necessarily for an IND, but, you know, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1204.0800000000002s)]
*  those things do provide information. They do help inform. And certainly companies [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1210.24s)]
*  certainly could skip some of those spots, some of those parallel tests in the interest of time. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1219.84s)]
*  Also, you know, I'm not sure how many companies conferred with the FDA, you know, it'd be [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1226.3999999999999s)]
*  interesting to understand how many people had regular interaction with the FDA versus those [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1232.6399999999999s)]
*  who've got clinical holds and whether or not, you know, it was because they didn't touch base [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1238.24s)]
*  with the FDA and, you know, understand what was expected. Yeah. Well, since you brought the FDA [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1242.56s)]
*  up, a couple of questions around the clinical hold phenomenon that we're seeing, if you want [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1251.28s)]
*  to call it a phenomenon, clinical holds are trending up as we've ascertained. First, give us [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1257.28s)]
*  an explanation, maybe, you know, maybe for those of us who are relatively new to the space and [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1263.9199999999998s)]
*  aren't intimately familiar with clinical holds and what they mean, you know, what are they [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1268.8s)]
*  and what's their impact on sector sentiment? A clinical hold is something that's issued by the [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1274.9599999999998s)]
*  FDA to the sponsor of a clinical trial, and it's a delay, really, generally associated with safety, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1285.28s)]
*  toxicity, and some concern around that. You know, it could be related to simply a side effect that [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1294.48s)]
*  there's a concern about, something that's been associated with a patient death that sometimes [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1304.32s)]
*  happens to better understand whether the death was related to the drug, whether it was related [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1310.08s)]
*  to a comorbidity or something else that could be related that you need to better understand. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1314.88s)]
*  So those would be some of the things that would be associated with a clinical hold. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1321.8400000000001s)]
*  When you're striving to excel in a new arena, the best guides are the ones already doing it well. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1329.2s)]
*  The business of biotech brings those voices forward to help new and emerging biopharmers turn their [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1334.8000000000002s)]
*  innovations like mRNA and cell and gene therapies into clinical realities. Tune in and subscribe [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1339.84s)]
*  for insights on hiring, regulatory, and other need-to-know topics for biopharma leaders. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1346.6399999999999s)]
*  The podcast is brought to you in collaboration with Cytiva. Check out their resources at [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1352.24s)]
*  Cytiva.com backslash emerging biotech. That's C-Y-T-I-V-A.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1357.68s)]
*  And you know, so we've already covered, you know, maybe some of the potential sponsor [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1368.0s)]
*  factors on the sponsor side that are contributing to an increase in clinical holds. But I'm curious [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1374.08s)]
*  about your take on the FDA's role or impact on clinical holds. You know, is that a variable? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1380.08s)]
*  You know, there's new leadership at the FDA. We're coming off of an unprecedented, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1389.36s)]
*  you know, 12 months in history where the FDA was issuing emergency youth authorization, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1395.4399999999998s)]
*  probably at a rate that they hadn't seen before, right? Like it was a tumultuous time for the [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1401.36s)]
*  agency, for an already stressed agency. Does that impact, like you mentioned, you use the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1408.4s)]
*  pendulum analogy. Is there a pendulum at the FDA perhaps to any degree that contributes to this [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1415.44s)]
*  whole scenario that we're seeing right now? It's definitely a factor. You know, I think, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, you talk about sentiment earlier. You know, I think the FDA has now introduced [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1428.96s)]
*  a level of risk that was previously not necessarily considered or viewed to be there. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1433.92s)]
*  Also, I think the reason the seat was open, in my view, for as long as it was before it was filled, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1443.2s)]
*  was because I think there was a little bit of a debate that was going on behind the scenes, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1448.72s)]
*  behind what was the posture of the new FDA commissioner. And I think there was a sensitivity [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1453.68s)]
*  about them being too cozy to big pharma or biotech or the industry, I guess, is a better [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1459.28s)]
*  way of looking at it these days. So I think that, you know, I think that is the bias, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  I think, going into this. So I think, you know, the debate around accelerated [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1471.84s)]
*  approvals and the commitments and the enforcement thereafter, I think, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1480.32s)]
*  speaks to that sentiment in many regards. I do think that you have to look at, you got to peel [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1487.44s)]
*  the onion a little bit. You know, for instance, about 40% of the clinical holds in the industry [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1494.96s)]
*  recently were related to gene and cell therapy. So, you know, I think that's proliferated and that [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1502.0800000000002s)]
*  modality is new. And that's, you know, there's as many questions as there are answers. It's probably [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1509.3600000000001s)]
*  a lot more questions than there are answers, actually. And I think people are just being [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1516.48s)]
*  careful there, particularly when there's concerns around durability and other... [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1521.52s)]
*  Safety for sure. Yeah. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1529.92s)]
*  Yeah. And these, some of these early therapies are one and done. So, you know, if you, you know, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1532.64s)]
*  and it precludes being able to do something else down the road. So, you know, there's this other [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1537.44s)]
*  considerations there. So, I think, you know, I don't know how to read the tea leaves, but I think [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1543.2s)]
*  it's a risk that I don't see necessarily going away in terms of the spirit of sentiment. You know, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1551.28s)]
*  I think it'll be a little bit of a driver when you look at the industry. You know, I think we, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1558.0800000000002s)]
*  as an industry, need to really work on the risk reward and biotap to improve. You know, I think, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1565.44s)]
*  you know, people... Once you demonstrate the risk reward, you know, I think you will see things [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1572.32s)]
*  that will be a big driver in sentiment at the end of the day. You know, people react to things [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1579.6s)]
*  emotionally, right? Fear and greed. And right now they're reacting to the fear of losing their money. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1585.4399999999998s)]
*  And once you show them that there's an opportunity to make good returns, the greed factor will [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1592.6399999999999s)]
*  bring them back to the table. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The greed factor. Does that greed factor though, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1600.64s)]
*  especially in the context of, you know, regulatory scrutiny, does that lead to [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1606.48s)]
*  a level of risk aversion that stifles innovation? I asked that question because, you know, it occurs [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1614.88s)]
*  to me that, hey, if I'm cognizant of the fact that, you know, the FDA's job is safety, safety, safety, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1619.92s)]
*  and then, you know, a little bit of efficacy. And I know that my gene or cell candidate, for instance, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1628.0s)]
*  has a lot of risk around it from a safety profile perspective. You know, maybe I take another look [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1634.56s)]
*  at that monoclonal antibody or that small molecule because I'm thinking, you know, safer bet, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1643.36s)]
*  maybe less innovative, maybe, you know, maybe less potential for breakthrough impact. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1649.36s)]
*  So I guess, you know, get back to the question. Does that, if that pendulum swings too far, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1657.76s)]
*  can it stifle risky innovation that, you know, risky innovation can be a positive as well. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1664.0s)]
*  It can, you know, it feeds the space. That's a good point that you raised. You know, I would say, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1672.32s)]
*  you know, you could argue a little bit is that, oh, we are victim of innovation and pushing the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1680.2399999999998s)]
*  envelope a little bit too hard and too fast. And, you know, that's definitely a contributing [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1685.44s)]
*  factor too. You know, when you have an easier flow of capital and you've got companies going out that [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1693.44s)]
*  are preclinical, you know, you're selling dreams, right? So, you know, I certainly think that, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1700.96s)]
*  you know, you could be well ahead of yourself on that. And I think if you look at some of the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1708.0s)]
*  company stocks out there, the companies that sold those dreams, they're penny stocks at these [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1714.48s)]
*  moments. And that speaks to the fact that, you know, the science wasn't there yet, you know, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1722.48s)]
*  and I think you see that with new modalities, right? This is not new. Anytime you introduce a [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1728.0s)]
*  new modality, you know, it has a high hurdles to prove the merit as a therapeutic class, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1733.76s)]
*  you know? I mean, I think RNAi again is a great, a classical example of that. It's 20 years in the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1742.08s)]
*  desert, you know, and that speaks to the cycle, you know, it was in and out, you know, late 90s, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1748.6399999999999s)]
*  early 2000, it was the flavor of the day, you roll the clock 10 years later and you're persona [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1756.7199999999998s)]
*  and grata and then 10 years. And, you know, it's a promising modality and we just scratched the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1762.56s)]
*  surface. So, you know, I think all of these things are great, you know, I would also say [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1768.56s)]
*  in this environment where capital is king, that the cell and gene therapies are very hard for small [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1774.72s)]
*  companies to take on just because the cost of the drug supply, the drug materials, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1783.76s)]
*  and, you know, every batch, everyone that you run is dear. And, you know, as we know, that doesn't [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1791.84s)]
*  always work the first time, so you need to be able to do that. So, it's tough. It's, in my view, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1797.36s)]
*  it's a little bit of a big boy sport, but I think the innovation comes from the small companies, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1804.6399999999999s)]
*  you just need to go back to other things that we've said, collaborate. And again, know what you know [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1809.76s)]
*  and know what you don't know. And I think, you know, a little bit of the brain drain and a little [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1815.36s)]
*  bit of what's been going on is that people, great people, smart people, but they don't necessarily [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1819.12s)]
*  have the scene and done it. Know what good looks like experience. And, you know, as our mutual friend, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1824.8s)]
*  Ian Walters often says, you know, you know, picking the right thing to do is 20% of the battle, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1834.08s)]
*  80% is figuring out what to do when it doesn't work. Yeah, yeah, that's a great segue to my [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1840.24s)]
*  next question, because Ian and I, you know, have had that conversation, like we, you know, we recently [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1846.08s)]
*  had that conversation and we spent a lot of time talking about it. And, you know, one of the things [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1851.44s)]
*  he talked to me about was what it's like, you know, the loneliness of being a CEO answering to [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1856.88s)]
*  investors when your stock's getting battered. Stock performance is a readout, right, that affects [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1863.04s)]
*  sentiment as well. It can snowball. If things are bad, it can snowball because it's a bet. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1873.1200000000001s)]
*  Look, everyone's getting the same look, so I'm not offending anyone by saying this, but it's a bad look. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1878.96s)]
*  But how important is that? How important, you know, everyone's concerned about it in the C-suite, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1884.32s)]
*  but how important is it in the long run? And what's decelerating it? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1894.32s)]
*  You know, I think you got to focus on execution and not let factors like that [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1897.84s)]
*  impact your day to day, because when you see it on a day to day basis, you know, you can view it as [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1911.9199999999998s)]
*  your report card, right? Every day, this is your report card, but you know, if you're doing something [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1918.72s)]
*  that you believe in, you know, you have confidence in what you're doing, you're really, you've got [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1923.2s)]
*  information that no one else does. And I think you got to be true to your conviction. And, you know, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1928.32s)]
*  and I think you got to be, you know, ask the important questions and kill things because time [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1934.88s)]
*  is the enemy. And I think it's not, you know, I think a lot of people are trying to buy for time [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1940.0s)]
*  to see if, and you know, you can lay off your staff and I, you know, and it asks the question, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1945.2s)]
*  why did you hire them in the first place? You know, I think you need to be focused on execution [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1949.52s)]
*  leanly and make sure you're funded to something. I think what people then consider, and I see this [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1955.92s)]
*  is the biggest risk looking out, is that people underestimated what they needed to run their [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1963.04s)]
*  business. And, you know, they were just grabbing money indiscriminately. And now there's an issue [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1971.52s)]
*  is, are you funded to any point? And, you know, as we all know, things generally cost more money [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1978.16s)]
*  and they take longer. So, you know, there's not a lot of room for error in that kind of environment, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1984.5600000000002s)]
*  in that kind of reality. You really do, I think people are doing high wire acts without a safety net [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1992.64s)]
*  under them. And so I think it's really important to not only capitalize yourself to your inflection [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=1998.48s)]
*  points, your milestones, going back to milestones. But you need to be able to go beyond it a little [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2003.92s)]
*  bit too. I think for a couple of reasons. One is you need to be able to, in case the experiment [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2010.48s)]
*  doesn't work, you know, you can't be just totally desperate. You don't want to put yourself in that [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2020.5600000000002s)]
*  position of desperation if you can help it. And then secondly, I think people now, and we've touched [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2026.72s)]
*  on it before that, when you do have positive data, you know, people immediately expect that [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2032.88s)]
*  you're going to be coming to the capital markets. So people are kind of shorting you in advance, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2037.6000000000001s)]
*  they're expecting a cover, and you're not. And people who have positions are saying, okay, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2042.96s)]
*  I'm just going to trade on this and get out because now this is a day of liquidity. So I think because [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2048.96s)]
*  of that, you just need to be very mindful of managing your cash and investing, really investing [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2055.92s)]
*  in the right stuff and making sure that, you know, the translational work is done, that, you know, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2063.28s)]
*  yeah, lung cancer is a great market, but have you done the experiments necessarily to inform the [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2069.6800000000003s)]
*  likelihood of the outcome? You know, when money was rolling around and the punch bowl was out there [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2076.56s)]
*  with a very low cost of capital, people were less disciplined and had bigger dreams. You know, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2082.16s)]
*  bigger dreams and less discipline is just not a good combination. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2087.2s)]
*  Well said. So you've alluded to some answers to this next question I want to ask you, but if you [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2093.52s)]
*  could kind of help crystallize what the leaders of biopharma can do, tactically, strategically, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2101.2s)]
*  should do in the face of bearish market sentiment. You know, and a lot of what you said is like, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2113.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, good business practice for, you know, sheltering from bearish market sentiment, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2121.68s)]
*  being prepared for it. When faced with it, though, I mean, do you have advice like around [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2128.56s)]
*  tactics or strategy or is there any, you know, ride it out, man? I don't know. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2134.24s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's, you know, no, I think there's ways that one should think about [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2139.7599999999998s)]
*  spending what limited gas you have in your tank and be very prudent and thoughtful about it in [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2146.88s)]
*  terms of how you dole it out. I mean, arguably, you should always be doing that, right? But I [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2156.32s)]
*  think human nature, we know what human nature is. And I think whether you're loaded, because a lot [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2161.76s)]
*  of companies are trading in cash, but they could have a couple of hundred million dollars on their [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2169.04s)]
*  balance sheet. You know, people aren't getting rewarded for their technology. And I think that's, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2172.8s)]
*  I think you have to think about yourself, what do you need to do to demonstrate that there's value [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2179.44s)]
*  in your technology? And I think the days of selling dreams are over. So, you know, you know, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2183.68s)]
*  it's really all about data. You know, we've said this before, and God, we trust in data, we believe. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2190.0s)]
*  So I think it's really for what people can do. I think it requires renewed stringency [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2196.96s)]
*  and more discipline to bring really higher quality products to the public [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2203.04s)]
*  over time. And I think in order to do that, I think there's a level of focus. You can't be [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2208.16s)]
*  everything to everybody. You know, I think people, you know, you know, they're like, like our kids, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2212.96s)]
*  you know, they say, I want this, this, this and this. But you know, our stomachs are bigger than [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2218.8s)]
*  our eyes are bigger than our bellies at the end of the day. And I think that there needs to be more [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2224.32s)]
*  general focus. And I think with that, you can manage your cash burn. And I think the expenses [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2230.2400000000002s)]
*  that you need to do need to be gated. You don't want to get too much in front of your skis. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2235.6s)]
*  Because I realized that like manufacturing is a great example, you know, there's a lot of pressure, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2240.4s)]
*  there's a lot of tension that you need manufacturing slots, there's spots of gear, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2246.56s)]
*  and can be a real rate limiting gating factor in terms of getting things done. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2251.36s)]
*  So people sometimes put a lot of money at risk there prior to even having any sort of data, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2256.8s)]
*  so preclinical or anything. So you know, you need, you need to be thoughtful about [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2262.64s)]
*  different steps of de-risking before you put money at risk and being mindful of what that is. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2268.32s)]
*  And to the extent you can gate that until you can de-risk it somewhere else [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2273.52s)]
*  would also be my humble suggestion. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2278.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, excellent. Good stuff. I want to ask you, as we get into sort of the spring early summer [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2282.2400000000002s)]
*  trade show and conference season, can we anticipate any bounces, any blips on the radar [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2292.48s)]
*  in terms of positive sentiment? You know, positive news coming out. We've got AACR just happened, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2300.96s)]
*  BIOS coming up here. I think BIO will have happened by the time this episode drops, but [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2308.1600000000003s)]
*  that's on the radar. ASCO, ISPE, Biotech, any number of upcoming shows and conferences. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2313.36s)]
*  Do they have an impact? Are they an opportunity for the biotech leaders who are going to go there [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2319.68s)]
*  and present to make an impact and to what end? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2324.4s)]
*  Totally, totally. I think these events have generally proven to be platforms and opportunities [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2330.4s)]
*  for people to really kind of pull the covers off and talk about data and what the company has done. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2338.88s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to ASCO. We are coming out of AACR, so I think that may [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2346.7999999999997s)]
*  may require us to temper our expectations of how the events will do in terms of driving sentiment. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2354.16s)]
*  This morning, for instance, I was looking at a tweet from Brad Lankar, and I'll read it to you, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2363.2s)]
*  and it really tells you what the sentiment coming out of AACR was. According to Brad, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2369.4399999999996s)]
*  the big winner of AACR is a $4 stock that's currently up 24 cents. That's straight up [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2375.76s)]
*  depressing. Yeah, well, that's not what I was hoping you'd say, Alan. It's interesting, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2382.0800000000004s)]
*  though. You would think that I'm going to be doing some traveling this spring and early summer for [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2390.2400000000002s)]
*  the first time in a long time, right? And so are a lot of other people. As these events start to [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2396.48s)]
*  open back up to in-person traffic and attendance again, you would think that maybe they would hold, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2402.88s)]
*  I don't know, the fact that we've been pent up for so long, and now things are coming back a bit, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2410.96s)]
*  you think they would pack a little bit more punch? I think there's interest. I'm not sure if it's a [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2416.0s)]
*  matter of interest. I think it's really more going back to how you framed things earlier sentiment. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2422.56s)]
*  And if we execute, if we as an industry had exciting news, I would look at news coming out [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2428.7999999999997s)]
*  for Tidget, other things like that, to show that, you know, oncology, some of these new classes of [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2436.48s)]
*  drugs will work. Those things are all helpful. If you have a continued failure, that's going to be [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2444.16s)]
*  disappointing. And it'll, again, people will sell on the good news. If we can, you know, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2453.92s)]
*  squeeze the shorts and change the sentiment in the tenor a little bit by putting a string, you know, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2461.76s)]
*  let's use baseball, a few base hits together, you know, and just get a little bit of a rally going. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2467.6800000000003s)]
*  I think you get people to pay closer attention. I think there's general view that we're at incredible [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2475.6800000000003s)]
*  value levels right now as an industry. Valuations have compressed. I don't think, as we've talked [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2480.8s)]
*  on, I don't think people who run companies necessarily are all with that on that hymn sheet. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2487.84s)]
*  But I think, you know, at the end of the day, you know, if you show a drug that works, the value is [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2496.32s)]
*  there, right? You know, if you can show somebody that's gone PDL negative to PDL positive, you know, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2503.04s)]
*  you just double the checkpoint market. So, you know, I think things will happen when you can [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2509.76s)]
*  do something like that. That's meaningful, right? Unfortunately, I don't think in 2022, we [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2515.36s)]
*  have been able to as an industry really to turn too much in that respect that's turned heads, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2522.8s)]
*  that's wooed, that's made a meaningful impact. And I think that's working against this. And that's [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2528.8s)]
*  coming off of the wonderful negative momentum we had coming out at 21. So we just need to change [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2536.88s)]
*  the tenor. So I think if we, those are all great platforms, these conferences, but you know, we [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2543.52s)]
*  need to be singing a different tune. Do you, I'll ask you one more question on this and then we'll [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2549.6s)]
*  wrap things up. Do you, I'm not going to ask you to, you know, name names or get specific, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2554.96s)]
*  but knowing what you know and looking at who you look at and studying what you study, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2561.36s)]
*  do you anticipate any of that positivity? Do you see opportunities for that tenor to change [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2566.64s)]
*  in the short term, you know, within the year, let's say? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2575.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, I definitely do. I'm a believer. You know, everything can't be negative. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2581.04s)]
*  You just can't. You just flip a coin. It's got to come up heads eventually. So, you know, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2587.6s)]
*  and I think there is good science being done. I think there's really the right kinds of work [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2595.44s)]
*  being done. I think it's just a little perhaps drowned out a little bit based on, again, the [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2600.0s)]
*  volume that we brought to the party right now. So I think, and I think it's like a ball that bounces [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2606.08s)]
*  off the table and won't bounce as high. It'll keep bouncing just not as high. So once some of the [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2612.48s)]
*  noise dissipates, you know, the cream always rises to the surface. So I think there's plenty of cream [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2617.92s)]
*  out there and I think it's a great opportunity and it's just a matter of being good stewards [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2624.96s)]
*  right now with your cash, you know, to manage through this storm. You know, going back to what [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2631.68s)]
*  you said earlier, you know, over the years, you know, there's been good times and there's bad times [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2638.0s)]
*  and I think that the folks that have been able to see both sides of that have been able to navigate [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2643.36s)]
*  through the bad times. And this is really everyone's true test and the true metal of everybody, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2649.28s)]
*  you know, do smart things, you know, you know, what I like to tell people when you're when you're [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2654.56s)]
*  allocating scarce resources, would you do this with your own money? You know, when doing your own [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2659.76s)]
*  money, then you shouldn't be doing it in my view. So be smart about it and don't take your [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2665.12s)]
*  investments for granted. That's a good note and Alan, thank you. Thank you for joining me for this [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2670.96s)]
*  conversation. Thank you for joining me for many of the conversations over the past 100 episodes and [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2677.2799999999997s)]
*  being an ally. We're going to move forward and I'm going to have you on a whole bunch more over the [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2683.7599999999998s)]

*  taught me so far. Thank you for the education along the way. It's been fun and it's been fun [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2699.8399999999997s)]

*  listening. But I appreciate the feedback and it's been fun and definitely to be continued. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2709.7599999999998s)]

*  you're my treadmill, you're my dog walk, you're my commute, your voice, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2720.48s)]
*  I equate your voice with these things. It's fun to hear. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2725.44s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. So that's Alan Shaw. I'm Matt Piller and you just listened to the [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7QRGpZMrAw&t=2730.48s)]
