Video Description: Kristin Yarema, Ph.D. thinks the progress of CAR T therapeutics is allogeneic. In fact, she says CAR T-cell therapies have to become a one-to-many proposition, if their early autologous success can possibly live up to the promise of offering widespread accessibility to life-saving treatments. Dr. Yarema is the newly-appointed CEO at Poseida Therapeutics, a company we first covered with founding CEO Eric Ostertag, Ph.D. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, we'll learn about Dr. Yarema, how she earned the company's reins, how Poseida is positioning itself to crack the allogeneic CAR T code, and how strategic collaborations with the likes of Astellas and Roche are fueling the effort.

# The Allogeneic Future with Poseida's Kristin Yarema, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [August 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY)
*  Autologous CAR T cell therapies represent a bright spot, perhaps the brightest spot, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=0.0s)]
*  on an ATMP landscape that's all at once brimming with promise and beleaguered by clinical letdowns. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=10.88s)]
*  Dr. Kristin Urema, newly appointed CEO at clinical stage CAR T developer Poseida Therapeutics, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  knows this very well, and yet she and Poseida are all in, not on autologous CAR Ts, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=26.0s)]
*  but are instead developing a pipeline of healthy donor-derived CAR T therapeutics, the Allogeneic approach. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=33.44s)]
*  The company's underlying intention is to change the cell therapy accessibility paradigm [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=41.2s)]
*  by leveraging the manufacturing and economic scale benefits of a one-too-many, off-the-shelf approach. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=47.28s)]
*  Poseida's candidates are many, and its support strong. It's got clinical programs in multiple [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=54.4s)]
*  myeloma and B-cell malignancies in partnership with Roche, and it just recently freshened up a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=59.92s)]
*  deal with Astellis to support its solid tumor programs. I'm Matt Piller, this is the Business [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  of Biotech, and longtime listeners might recall that Poseida founder and then-CEO Eric Oostertag [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=71.2s)]
*  joined me on the podcast a few years back. Well, today I'm excited to catch up on the company with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=78.72s)]
*  Dr. Yurima, who was president of the cell therapy practice there for less than a year before [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=84.16s)]
*  taking on the CEO role in January of this year. Dr. Yurima, welcome to the show. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=90.24s)]
*  Thank you so much, Matt. I am just thrilled to be here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=96.96s)]
*  I'm thrilled to have you here, and I always kind of follow an arc in my interviews, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=99.84s)]
*  and no matter how uncomfortable it makes my Biotech exec guests feel, I like to get a little bit of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=106.8s)]
*  background on you and why you're doing what you're doing. Perusing your LinkedIn profile, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=113.76s)]
*  it's not hard to kind of follow a little bit of a trajectory there. After earning your PhD in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  chemical and biomolecular engineering, doing a Max Planck fellowship, you joined McKinsey, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  which is not super uncommon among the Biotech execs that I've interviewed. It's sort of a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  springboard into multiple things, but I want to kind of get your perspective in your own words [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=140.08s)]
*  without making assumptions on sort of what you were thinking about doing when you joined McKinsey [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=145.84s)]
*  and what sort of a career you were looking to form up at the time, whether it was sort of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  orchestrated or you were just kind of feeling out the waters. What was kind of going on then? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=157.36s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So at the time that I was finishing all of my scientific work, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=162.24s)]
*  I think I would say I had come to the conclusion that I was industry ready. I love the science. I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=169.68s)]
*  always loved everything that I was doing and I carry that passion with me even today, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  but I had come to the conclusion that I was probably less wired to go and be the world expert [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=183.12s)]
*  in a narrow scientific field, although I could have gone that path and that was probably the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=191.36s)]
*  dream I had had since I was 10 years old. But I realized that I would be happier and probably [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=199.68s)]
*  more productive by spreading my energies and my efforts across a wide range of areas. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=207.44s)]
*  And I really wanted to have more immediate impact. I was always very much about impact. That's why I [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  chose engineering over a pure science scientific training, actually. I always wanted to be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  working on things that were very applied. I wanted to see the fruits of the project in quite real [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=227.12s)]
*  time. And so I started to think, okay, I'm probably not a lifetime academic here. I need to get into [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=233.52s)]
*  industry, specifically medicine. And I had some medical members of my family, practitioners, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=241.76s)]
*  nobody really in bio-pharma research. And so I thought, okay, that's my next step. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=249.12s)]
*  And I could have gone to be an industry scientist. That was a very viable path. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=256.96s)]
*  But at that time, McKinsey and some of the other consultancies were recruiting [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  new PhDs and PhD students very heavily because they had come to the conclusion that they often [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=267.28s)]
*  made excellent management consultants. And it had to do with how they approach their work. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=273.12s)]
*  So their approach to their work was really, as I saw it, applying the scientific method, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=279.12s)]
*  but to business problems. So you get a problem, you formulate a hypothesis, you go and investigate, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=285.36s)]
*  you come to some conclusions, you present them. And I thought to myself, hey, that's great. I can [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=292.48s)]
*  do that. I can formulate hypotheses about anything and go and investigate them. And so I'll [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=296.88s)]
*  see where that leads me. I'll get an overview of the biotech and bio-pharma industry. I was [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  very clear with McKinsey that I really wanted to focus in healthcare. And they gave me the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=312.88s)]
*  opportunity to do that. And see if this was the industry for me, get closer to the front end of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=317.2s)]
*  the healthcare system and start working on medicines that were either already on the market [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=325.68s)]
*  or things that would be near the clinic. And it was really a fantastic opportunity to do that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  Consultants are so expensive that whatever they're working on, the project that they're [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=340.08s)]
*  hired for is always of great importance to the company because otherwise, why would you splash [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=345.92s)]
*  out expensive consulting dollars for that? So early in your career, it's a fantastic way to see [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=351.2s)]
*  many, many different companies and many different products and areas. So I worked for 19 of the top [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=359.44s)]
*  20 pharma companies at that time, a whole lot of biotechs. I did growth strategy, R&D strategy, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=367.2s)]
*  quite a bit of org work, product turnaround, just about every conceivable sort of project. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=373.44s)]
*  And so I left with, I think, a really good understanding of the landscape of the biopharma [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  industry. And that led me to the conclusion that this is where I want it to be. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=388.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's really cool. The intent of this podcast from the outset and remaining, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  it remains, is to inspire and educate your peer biotech execs. I mean, there's a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  great community of biotech execs, upstart biotech execs. And this podcast was sort of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  created to create a forum for them and a source of information. But one of the more interesting [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=414.24s)]
*  and rewarding elements of this pod, I mean, we're 200, I think this will be like 212 some episodes [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=420.16s)]
*  in, one of the more rewarding aspects is the feedback that I get and the questions that I get [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=427.92s)]
*  from people who are still in academia and are considering pursuing a career in big pharma or [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=432.8s)]
*  biotech or biopharma. And a question that I'm often asked is like, what do I do once I have my PhD? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=441.76s)]
*  Like, you know, the people that you've interviewed, they've come at it from all different angles. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=448.8s)]
*  What's the most efficient path? And it sounds to me like this consulting opportunity was an [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  efficient path for you. Because the other aspect of that is like a lot of the students who come out, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  even seasoned execs who come out of academia, for instance, or practicing physicians, when they [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=465.28s)]
*  decide that they're going to go into industry, they struggle mightily with the transition to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=471.28s)]
*  business. Would you, I mean, would you agree with that? And would you suggest perhaps like [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  the consultancy route is a pretty- I would, yeah. For me, it was fantastic. So what I would say is, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=481.52s)]
*  you will work very hard, but you will see a lot. You will see many, many different projects, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=486.72s)]
*  many different companies. And I think the pattern recognition is really very powerful because it [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=494.16s)]
*  helps you become very calibrated, right? You learn, you know, this challenge has been faced by many [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=500.72s)]
*  other companies many times before. It's always going to feel unique and very present to that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=507.76000000000005s)]
*  current situation or that current team. But you will say, yeah, I've seen this 10 times before. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=512.48s)]
*  And by the way, every other company is facing exactly the same questions and challenges. You [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=517.12s)]
*  know, here's some ideas that I picked up that might be relevant, or here's why your situation [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=521.04s)]
*  is a little bit unique, you know, relative to others. So I think it's, you know, there's a lot [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=525.6s)]
*  of travel and there's a lot of hard work involved, but it's really an excellent training ground. And [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  I think the other piece that for me was very important was, you know, working in consulting, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=535.92s)]
*  which is a team-based approach and it's client service, right? Which can be challenging. You're, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=544.4799999999999s)]
*  you know, you're all, you have a customer, you have a client, company. It really taught me a lot about [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  how to work effectively in teams, how to be a leader of teams and organizations and how to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=555.12s)]
*  bring people together cross-functionally to solve very, very complicated problems. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=561.84s)]
*  So, you know, as a student or a researcher, I was very good at solving problems myself, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=566.32s)]
*  you know, that I had defined, but I did not receive training how to solve very complicated [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  problems that required inputs from lots of different people or places and how to move things [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=580.0s)]
*  that require efforts from many people forward effectively. I don't think academia is a great [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=586.96s)]
*  training ground for that, but you do it all the time, you know, when you're, you know, parachuted [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=591.52s)]
*  in as a consultant or you have, because a lot of the projects you have to go around and work with [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=596.48s)]
*  many, many different areas of the company. So, you know, now I see, you know, tremendous power and [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=600.48s)]
*  where I am today, I think much less about my job is, you know, I need to solve X. That is not my job. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=608.4s)]
*  My job is, you know, the path for the company forward needs to be charted or we need to solve [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  XYZ problems as a company. And what I need to do is ensure that that happens somehow involving or [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=621.84s)]
*  bringing together whatever people or resources or outside experts or whatever is needed to do the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=629.84s)]
*  task. So, I think that experience in particular is very different or can be very different in [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=636.0s)]
*  industry versus in academia. And you mentioned that people sometimes struggle with transition. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=642.48s)]
*  What I've seen is it can often be about that. It's not about the science. It's not about the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=648.64s)]
*  medicine. It's about how do I fit into a corporate environment and get things done? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=652.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The other thing that I hear quite frequently is the struggle with the language, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  right? Like it's a whole different vocabulary. Yes. And you learn that vocabulary, I'm sure, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=663.76s)]
*  pretty quickly working at McKinsey. Speaking of vocabulary, digging even further back into your [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=669.28s)]
*  academic days, I've got a question for you about the duality of Dr. Kristen Urema. Before you earned [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=676.96s)]
*  your PhD, you doubled up your undergrad efforts at Stanford in chemical and biomolecular engineering. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=683.6s)]
*  You also earned a BA in English literature, both with honors, I might add. It begs the question, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=692.4s)]
*  what's behind that? Was it a conscious effort to balance out your left and right brain [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=700.88s)]
*  equilibrium? What's the story there? Yeah. Well, Matt, I got to hand it to you. You have really [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=709.6800000000001s)]
*  done your homework on me. But I suppose the answer is yes. In fact, it's why I elected to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=714.88s)]
*  go to Stanford in the first place. I was looking for a school that was very strong as an undergraduate, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=723.6s)]
*  very strong in the technical disciplines and very strong in the arts and humanities. And that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=728.48s)]
*  you know, that is really a duality or attention that I felt all my life. So, you know, growing up, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=734.96s)]
*  I was very much pulled to, you know, science and math and technology, but also very much pulled [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=743.84s)]
*  to the arts and humanities, literature, music. So, you know, it was so as an undergraduate, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=751.44s)]
*  I elected not to choose. My choice was not with, you know, decided not to decide and pursued both [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=759.04s)]
*  of those. I ultimately concluded that I was likely to have more impact on, I don't know, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  the world at large, I suppose, you know, by heading down the technical path and going into [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=774.16s)]
*  biopharma. And I've been very happy with that choice. I actually get more opportunity to exercise [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=780.8s)]
*  my creative juices than I would have expected in the industry. We have, you know, lots of visual [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=787.76s)]
*  and verbal communication to be sure. But I also think that bringing creativity to looking at [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=793.76s)]
*  drug development and commercialization, you know, is really important. You know, these molecules [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=802.48s)]
*  are cells. They do not come with instructions. And clinical development in particular, I think, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=807.92s)]
*  is very strategic and often coming up with ideas that are not cookie cutter, not what everybody [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=813.36s)]
*  else did, or where you're going to build in your product differentiation, or where you're going to, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=819.44s)]
*  you know, take something that could have been an okay therapy and really make it, you know, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=824.16s)]
*  a remarkable one, which I've been honored to have the opportunity to do, you know, a few times in [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=830.88s)]
*  my career. But I would also say, you know, to anybody out there today who may be, you know, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=836.32s)]
*  feeling a similar, you know, duality and similar tension, that I would not say that one could not [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=842.24s)]
*  have impact as, you know, as an artist or someone in the humanities today. The older I get, the more [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  I think, you know, we really should be valuing as a society our artists just as much as our builders. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=856.16s)]
*  So yeah, yeah. Well said. Well said. I mean, you are a great communicator. That's quite obvious. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=864.08s)]
*  That English lit effort serves you well. And hopefully you still find time to read and enjoy, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=871.76s)]
*  maybe even write a little bit. You're welcome to welcome Bright for Bioprocess online anytime you'd [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=878.4s)]
*  like. I may take you up on that. Yeah. After McKinsey, you moved on to BigBio, Novartis and Amgen. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=883.04s)]
*  So I'm curious about that. Like what sort of precipitated the transition to [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=893.44s)]
*  to bio, to BigBio in particular? Yeah. Well, I had always thought that I would, you know, move [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=899.44s)]
*  to industry at the right time. I actually stayed in consulting longer than I anticipated just because [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=905.9200000000001s)]
*  I enjoyed it so much. For me, the right time ultimately became when I got married to another [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=911.6s)]
*  consultant, by the way. And, you know, it was like, okay, it's time to stop running around the globe, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=918.0s)]
*  stop traveling, you know, have something that keeps me in one place a little bit more. And so, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=923.92s)]
*  you know, that led me to taking the first role at Novartis and later Amgen, as you said. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  So it was always a planned transition, I guess. Why BigBio and not Biotech to start with? Well, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=942.8s)]
*  you know, I had more familiarity with the big company setting because more of the clients [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=950.8000000000001s)]
*  as a consultant were big companies because they can afford it. And, you know, and I felt I knew [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=957.9200000000001s)]
*  how to navigate that setting pretty well. Really liked what Novartis was doing at the time. And I [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=964.24s)]
*  got a absolutely great first role. You know, I came in and I was really overseeing all of the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=971.0400000000001s)]
*  commercial inputs and strategy, product strategy for a huge chunk of Novartis' pipeline. It was [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=977.2s)]
*  everything outside of oncology, which was a little ironic because in McKinsey, I was kind of known [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=983.36s)]
*  as the oncology person and my PhD was kind of in oncology. But, you know, you kind of go where [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=988.5600000000001s)]
*  you need it. And so that was an opportunity to, you know, to learn everything else. And I would [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=992.96s)]
*  say that's, you know, I think that's a good first move because large companies have lots of [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1000.4000000000001s)]
*  experience. They have lots of resources. And I don't just mean financial resources, but I mean [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1008.48s)]
*  other people, knowledgeable people. So you can really, you know, continue to learn a lot. And [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1012.6400000000001s)]
*  it's different being inside a company than as a consultant. Consulting, you also learn a lot, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1018.6400000000001s)]
*  but it's different being a part of the machinery versus just, you know, helping [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1024.24s)]
*  tinker with it from the outside, I suppose. Yeah. Did your husband follow suit eventually [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1030.4s)]
*  and join industry? Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, there was a time when we kept, you know, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1035.92s)]
*  going around to different companies together. We were three companies in a row together, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1042.16s)]
*  obviously not in the same job. But, you know, it was a very interesting two-body problem. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1046.32s)]
*  When we started, when we left, you know, large biopharma eventually and moved to biotechs, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1052.96s)]
*  you know, now we're, we don't cross paths really anymore. But it was, it was, it was fun. You know, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1059.3600000000001s)]
*  it's, it's, I think it's good to have someone who, you know, understands a frame of reference that [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1066.24s)]
*  you're working with every day. You know, you just have to make sure you're not talking about, you [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1071.68s)]
*  know, work too much off the clock. All the time. Yeah. Yeah. It's a novel frame of reference for [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1075.68s)]
*  sure. What, what, what, what was the, I guess, modus operandi when you, when you did leave [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1080.24s)]
*  BigBio and move into biotech? That was with, uh, ATARA? Yes. Yes. With, with ATARA. Exactly. So, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1086.64s)]
*  you know, back, back when I was still doing research, you know, when I was a researcher, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1095.92s)]
*  some of the areas that I was working on were, were things that just at that time were not ready for [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1103.2s)]
*  prime time. So it was a very early days of working with cells. We were doing hollow fiber [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1108.64s)]
*  bioreactors, you know, synthetic biology was kind of really just emerging. None of this stuff was [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1114.48s)]
*  really ready for prime time. Like the very first tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which are now, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1120.4s)]
*  you know, bog standard in many, you know, cancers as treatment work were just being discovered. So [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1124.88s)]
*  I had always been really energized by these advanced modalities and advanced therapies, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1131.04s)]
*  but we just weren't there yet back in those days, but I had kept my eye on the space [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1139.52s)]
*  and always thought that cell therapy was particularly exciting. And so when, you know, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1144.56s)]
*  when I got the call, which came in through my network, you know, not through, not through a [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1150.96s)]
*  recruiter, got the call from Pascal Toucheon, the CEO of Attara Biotherapeutics, I thought, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1154.56s)]
*  okay, this, I wasn't looking at the time, but I was like, this is the one, this is, you know, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1164.6399999999999s)]
*  this is the opportunity to finally make the move for, because it was something that I was [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1168.48s)]
*  really passionate about. I looked at the technology, I had seen so many, you know, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1176.48s)]
*  so many drugs, scores, hundreds of drugs, you know, feel very calibrated on separating the wheat [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1183.04s)]
*  from the chaff at this stage. And I said, okay, you know, I think what they're doing is really [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1189.28s)]
*  important and is likely to work. And I liked the people. It's another piece of guidance that I [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1193.76s)]
*  would give to people considering that transition. A large, you know, biopharma, you know, there are [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1198.8s)]
*  many, if you're, if you don't like the situation you are in, you can always go to another therapeutic [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1204.8s)]
*  area. Or maybe you can, if you're a commercial person, you can go to a different country even. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1209.2s)]
*  In a small company, the people are the people, you know, those are the people you had better [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1214.64s)]
*  like them, you were going to spend a lot of time with them. So make your choice very carefully, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1219.76s)]
*  not just based on the technology, which is table stakes, and you better like that too, but also [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1224.88s)]
*  really on the cultural fit. And if you think you're going to be excited to work with these people. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1230.56s)]
*  So all of that fit for me. I joined a Tara, as you said, a couple of weeks before the pandemic [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1236.0s)]
*  started literally, which was, you know, very interesting onboarding experience, you know, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1244.88s)]
*  in and of itself. And I joined as chief commercial officer. I also had corporate communications as [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1251.1200000000001s)]
*  part of that. And a Tara's an amazing company. And it was, it was really, you know, words cannot [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1258.72s)]
*  describe what it was like to be part of the team and the organization that got the first, the world's [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1268.0s)]
*  first ever allogeneic T cell immunotherapy through approval. It's a product called a Valo for a rare [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1276.48s)]
*  type of lymphoma that transplant patients can sometimes get. And it is, it is terrible patients [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1283.04s)]
*  who fail their first therapy for PTLD have a median, median life expectancy of something like [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1290.56s)]
*  three weeks. So it's very serious, very acute, and you really need in a powerful and immediately [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1299.2s)]
*  available therapy to do that. So Valo is an allogeneic T cell immunotherapy that is now [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1305.76s)]
*  available for these patients in Europe and hopefully soon in the U S as well. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1313.76s)]
*  How did that, that when feel different than, I mean, you know, in your years at Novartis Namjian, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1319.12s)]
*  you played a role in a lot of wins for sure. How did the win at a Tara feel different and perhaps [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1327.76s)]
*  influence what you did next? Like what you chose, where you chose to take your career after that? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1338.16s)]
*  If at all. Yeah, absolutely. No, no, it absolutely did. So I would say [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1344.32s)]
*  drug development in general is hard, right? People need to know this is a hard business. It is high [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1351.2s)]
*  risk. It's a very long cycle time. You know, it's, it's, it's difficult. Even more difficult [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1355.76s)]
*  is to try to do something that is entirely new, right? Develop a therapy that is an entirely new [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1365.1200000000001s)]
*  modality. It's got all kinds of risks, you know, lots of, you know, lots of discussions with health [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1371.68s)]
*  authorities. What's the regulatory path? You know, how do we gauge quality manufacturing for this [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1377.52s)]
*  thing? You know, how do we fund this thing? Exactly. All of this, right? You know, it's, it's, so [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1382.8799999999999s)]
*  I think different and particularly exciting and meaningful is yeah, you know, this company, this [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1390.9599999999998s)]
*  team were the first to really make this happen. And it was not easy. It was incredibly challenging. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1399.92s)]
*  There were many, you know, hurdles and challenges along the way, but you know, it eventually got [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  there. And I'm confident that today there are people alive, you know, enjoying their lives and [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1413.92s)]
*  with their families who otherwise, you know, otherwise they would not be so successful. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1420.8s)]
*  Otherwise they would not be so, you know, were it not for those efforts. So, you know, I think [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1427.2s)]
*  that's, you know, that's particularly meaningful. That's something that I'll always take with me. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1433.3600000000001s)]
*  And how did that impact me in terms of, you know, preparing me for eventually coming to [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1440.0s)]
*  Poseida? Well, in a few ways, I think I would say first, it gave me absolute conviction that [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1446.88s)]
*  the future of cell therapy must be allogeneic. I just gave you a great example. You know, there [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1454.72s)]
*  are patients out there in a number of diseases who cannot wait for bespoke autologous cell [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1462.72s)]
*  therapies to be manufactured, which can take weeks to months if the capacity is even available, you [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  know, to, to manufacture that therapy for them. And that, that's just not acceptable. Cell therapy [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1478.08s)]
*  is so powerful. We need to, you know, offer every patient who deserves to have the benefit [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1483.36s)]
*  of cell therapy to have that opportunity to do so. And for that, we need allogeneic cell therapy [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1491.28s)]
*  that uses great starting material, healthy donor cells and starting material can be [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1498.7199999999998s)]
*  manufactured at scale at much lower cost and can be, you know, either stored at hospitals or shipped [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1504.56s)]
*  overnight to be ready right when that physician and patient together make the decision that cell [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1511.04s)]
*  therapy is the right next step. So it gave me that absolute conviction. And it also put me in the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1516.08s)]
*  position of really coming to understand, let's say, the state of play of cell therapy. There are so [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1523.28s)]
*  many cell therapy companies out there, and it can be difficult to really understand how they're [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1530.8s)]
*  different. Right? Everybody is making big claims. We're very different from everybody else, but it [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1536.56s)]
*  can be quite challenging even for people in the field to understand exactly how. So since I was [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1541.44s)]
*  in the space, it really gave me the opportunity to go deep and, you know, and learn about all of the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1549.84s)]
*  companies in the space. And I saw data from Poseida at an ASCO GU conference, genitourinary [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1557.12s)]
*  conference for a prostate cancer program that Poseida had. And this is a solid tumor. Cartes [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1568.56s)]
*  have really struggled in solid tumors. And I saw that data at the poster. I didn't get very much [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1576.1599999999999s)]
*  attention at the time, but I saw it and said, you know, I think that's really remarkable data in [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1581.9199999999998s)]
*  solid tumors for CAR-T. I'm going to take more of a look under the hood, which I did. And, you know, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1586.48s)]
*  really learning more about Poseida's technology, I came to the conclusion that Poseida really has [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1596.32s)]
*  the winning set of proprietary, you know, totally different genetic engineering tools and supporting [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1603.1200000000001s)]
*  technologies. And so really has all the elements that are necessary to make allogeneic cell [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1613.2s)]
*  therapy happen. And so that started the process by which I ultimately joined Poseida. Yeah. And when [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1620.0s)]
*  you joined, that was 22, correct? In 22? It was April of last year. So April of 2023. Of 23. Okay. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1627.2s)]
*  Yeah. And you joined as president of the cell therapy division? Yes, I did. Yes. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1637.04s)]
*  What was, what sort of differentiated that role from the role that you're in now? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1643.2s)]
*  Ah, yes. Great question. So Poseida at its core is actually a platform technology company. So you [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1650.96s)]
*  mentioned, you know, Eric Oostertec. So Eric was the first gene therapy student out of the University [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1658.96s)]
*  of Pennsylvania, very first one. And way back then, you know, he quickly came to the conclusion [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1665.68s)]
*  that the kind of tools that were available, a lot of which relied on viral vector technology, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1673.1200000000001s)]
*  just would never be able to deliver the kinds, the profiles of the kinds of medicines that we [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1680.5600000000002s)]
*  would ultimately need. So a lot of limitations of viral technology. So there's a lot of safety [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1686.48s)]
*  concerns, expensive and difficult to manufacture. But also the versatility is limited. You can only [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1692.56s)]
*  pack so much DNA in a virus. And so it's very difficult to put a lot of functionality into [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1701.6s)]
*  your medicine. So he developed an entirely different set of tools and completely unique approaches [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1708.08s)]
*  to do this. So we use those tools today on two sides of the business. So we use them in an [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1716.16s)]
*  ex vivo or outside the body way to engineer cells. And that is our alginated CAR T, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1725.8400000000001s)]
*  but we can also use them in vivo as genetic medicines. And so we have a program in gene [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  editing, for example, a program in non viral gene insertion. So I came in to start leading just the [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1740.0s)]
*  cell therapy, the alginate cell therapy division, as you said, but Poseida actually has much more, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1749.68s)]
*  you know, many more programs and much more technology under its umbrella than just cell [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1757.12s)]
*  therapy, though those programs are in the lead. Yeah, yeah. And I mean, that sort of begs the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1762.24s)]
*  question, given so Poseida being a cell therapy company, a gene therapy company, and even within [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1768.4s)]
*  the cell therapy program, like the solid tumor programs, there's a there's a it's a pretty broad [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1774.64s)]
*  array of indications that that you're looking at, right? I mean, solid tumors across multiple, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1780.96s)]
*  multiple indications. How how would you say your experiences, you know, from McKinsey on McKinsey [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1787.3600000000001s)]
*  through BigBio sort of prepared you to, you know, move from a cell therapy discipline leadership of [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1795.2s)]
*  a very specific cell therapy discipline to leadership of a company that is multifaceted, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1802.72s)]
*  to say the least in terms of its, the targets and indications it's going at? Yeah. Well, so so I would [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1809.2s)]
*  say I am really grateful for all the preparation and all the training that I had, starting with [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1816.8s)]
*  consulting, you know, being at Novartis and Amgen, because I really did have the opportunity to do [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1826.0s)]
*  just about everything. So I was in many commercial roles, global, in country pipeline, in market, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1833.6s)]
*  life cycle management, but also time in clinical development, you know, strategy, business [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1844.4s)]
*  development. You know, I was originally trained as a biochemical engineer. So, you know, what do they [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1850.5600000000002s)]
*  do? You culture cells. So, you know, it's it's been, you know, definitely something of a wandering [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1856.96s)]
*  career journey, I would be the first to admit that. But I'm very grateful to have had all the [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1865.3600000000001s)]
*  different experiences in different functions and seeing different things that I have, because I [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1872.16s)]
*  think that has really given me a great perspective on all the different areas, you know, that need to [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1878.72s)]
*  happen, all the different capabilities that company needs to be successful. You know, I mentioned [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1888.4s)]
*  corporate communications at a Tara, you know, that taught me about investor relations and, you know, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1893.76s)]
*  managing the whole investor side. So all of these different experiences, and I wouldn't say that [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1900.0s)]
*  someone has to have all of them in order to, you know, to take on a leadership role like CEO. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1905.36s)]
*  But I will say, I feel very well prepared, having seen, you know, and played a role in so many [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1911.28s)]
*  different places. And I think that helps me be calibrated on, you know, what's likely to be [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1918.88s)]
*  an issue that needs real attention, maybe needs my personal attention, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1928.88s)]
*  versus other things that are just going to work themselves out, or it's just, you know, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1932.8s)]
*  kind of business as usual. Yeah, it's a challenge, but we're going to work through it. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1936.0s)]
*  And that I think is a very important and valuable skill, because no one can be everywhere at once, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1940.16s)]
*  right? You really need to pick your spots and you need to pick your altitude. And again, I'm very [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1945.76s)]
*  thankful that I had, you know, so much opportunity to see so many things and so many different [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1952.72s)]
*  therapies in development or on the market or whatever, because it really gives me [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1958.48s)]
*  comfort and confidence in knowing where to go in that way. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1965.3600000000001s)]
*  A lot of the things that you've said about the CEO role, what led to that? Like what was the [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1968.32s)]
*  sequence of events? You know, there was some transition there from Eric to, was Mark Gergen? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1976.8s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. Yes. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1981.28s)]
*  In between the two of you. Then, you know, I always hesitate to ask these questions about [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1982.64s)]
*  CEO transitions, because sometimes there's, you know, uncomfortable stories behind those [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1986.56s)]
*  transitions. But what led you from president of the cell therapy practice to CEO of the whole company? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think this was all very well planned. So one of the things I love about Poseida is [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2000.56s)]
*  Poseida is very systematic. You know, for a small company, we really try to be, you know, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2006.64s)]
*  rigorous and move quickly, but be, you know, have some method and not just madness all the time. So, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2012.88s)]
*  you know, you're absolutely right. So Eric founded the company, you know, really put in place what we [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2021.76s)]
*  have that's Poseida today. But then around the time of the first transition, which was moving the [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2027.5200000000002s)]
*  programs, you know, from research, from being a research stage company to starting to go into the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2032.88s)]
*  clinic, you know, that's where the transition to Mark Gergen came. And Mark, who still currently [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2038.96s)]
*  serves as our executive chairman, by the way, you know, had an absolutely fantastic set of skills [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2045.68s)]
*  and experiences for the company at its next stage. He is a phenomenal deal maker and, you know, just [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2052.6400000000003s)]
*  has a legendary resume within biotech amongst other things. He was one of the co-founders of [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2059.52s)]
*  Maradi. So he was really instrumental in, you know, providing the foundation for Poseida in the form [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2064.64s)]
*  of some of these partnerships, capitalizing the company. So, you know, putting together the Roche [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2072.48s)]
*  deal, helping to orchestrate the first deal with Estellas. I was just looking back actually earlier [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2078.0s)]
*  this week at the non-dilutive capital that the company has raised. We've only ever done one small [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2085.52s)]
*  equity raise since the time of the IPO. And over the last three years alone, we've secured $400 [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2092.48s)]
*  million in non-dilutive financing through these partnerships. And we've got, you know, maybe up [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2099.92s)]
*  to another 150 million coming potentially just in the next 12 to 18 months alone. So Mark, you know, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2105.84s)]
*  really put all of that in place for Poseida and then saw that the next transition point was coming, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2112.88s)]
*  the next inflection point, which is for Poseida to be, you know, really a full-fledged clinical [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2121.6800000000003s)]
*  stage company, which we are. We have three programs in the clinic. We have, you know, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2126.48s)]
*  several programs rapidly approaching the clinic in the CAR-T. And then we have, you know, the genetic [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2130.4s)]
*  medicines programs. And we've said we'll have at least one IND in 2025 on that side as well. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2136.0800000000004s)]
*  So, you know, for Poseida now in our next phase, you know, this is where the rubber hits the road [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2141.68s)]
*  in execution of clinical development, you know, strategy, delivering data, you know, thinking [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2148.4s)]
*  about target product profiles, you know, making sure we have the data to support them, you know, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  all of that. And I think that's, you know, where my experience and my skill set and having seen [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2160.96s)]
*  an allogeneic T cell immunotherapy all the way across the finish line, you know, those are some [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2167.68s)]
*  of the skills that we're looking for now. Yeah. I mean, you're, you know, you've got some, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2173.2s)]
*  as we've ascertained, some commercial chops. I don't want to put, I don't want to get too far [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2179.52s)]
*  ahead of our skis here, but I mean, I imagine putting Dr. Kristen Urema in this position [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2183.8399999999997s)]
*  puts you in a nice position to stay there, at least for, you know, so I don't want to say [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2190.8799999999997s)]
*  long-term, you know, we don't, we don't want to look too far into the future, but for some amount [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2196.96s)]
*  of time, given your commercial chops. I could not be happier at Poseida. This is right where I want [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2200.32s)]
*  to be. Poseida is the real deal. You know, I truly believe we are probably the emerging leader in [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2205.28s)]
*  allogeneic cell therapy and genetic medicines, you know, and it's, it's the technology and it is, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2212.88s)]
*  like I said earlier, equally the people, you know, the culture here is very, very special. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2219.28s)]
*  You know, people have a really unique ability to just make things happen. And I've seen a lot of [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2224.0s)]
*  companies, I feel, you know, very, very well calibrated on that. I tell, I tell our people [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2228.88s)]
*  that all the time, like, you don't understand how special this place really is. You know, it's this [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2234.48s)]
*  look around you, look at your colleagues, you know, be thankful for them. Yeah, that's great. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2238.4s)]
*  Give us a little update on how the pipeline has, has kind of come together in the time that you've [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2244.4s)]
*  been there and shortly before an update on that. And then I want to talk a little bit more [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2249.68s)]
*  specifically about some of the partnership deals, because I mean, that's so important, you know, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2253.44s)]
*  not just from a product development standpoint, moving the ball down the field, but to your point, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2257.12s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's been a financial boon to Poseida as well, right, keeping the lights on, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2265.44s)]
*  keeping the employees getting their paychecks and doing the good work. So, so let's, let's start [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2271.12s)]
*  with the pipeline though. Just give us an update on recent pipeline advance. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2277.12s)]
*  Absolutely. So the pipeline is, is going like gangbusters, I guess that's it in a nutshell. So, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2282.72s)]
*  you know, it really started, I would say with, with Ash last December, December of 2023. So that [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2289.44s)]
*  was the first time that we really put up a data set for the program that is the most in the lead, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2296.4s)]
*  which is the, the myeloma program, PBCMA Allo-1. So this is one of the two programs, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2302.64s)]
*  Heem programs that's partnered with Roche, the lead in that partnership. And what we, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2309.6s)]
*  it was an early data set, but what we showed was that an allogeneic CAR-T [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2317.12s)]
*  really has the promise to be at least as good as a, as an autologous CAR-T. And I think right now, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2324.3199999999997s)]
*  that's something that most of the industry does not believe, right? There's been a lot of [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2330.4s)]
*  challenges in allogeneic CAR-T, you know, a lot of, you know, there's a lot of hype and, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2334.56s)]
*  and some setbacks. We believe that you need a particular kind of allogeneic T cell to be [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2340.96s)]
*  the foundation of your CAR-T, the T stem cell memory cell, not just any old T cell will do, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2348.56s)]
*  it's got to be that. And to get that kind of CAR-T, you can't use a viral technology. You really have [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2353.6s)]
*  to use a transposon technology, which is what we use. So this was the first data set for a program, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2359.04s)]
*  you know, with, with that profile. And what we showed is in a, in a very, very heavily pre-treated [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2365.68s)]
*  population, probably the sickest multiple myeloma population ever treated, we saw an overall response [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2372.32s)]
*  rate that was, you know, incredibly competitive with the autologous CAR-Ts. And we saw great [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  depth of response. It was a very early data set. So we don't, you know, we didn't really know about [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2386.96s)]
*  durability at that time, but we really liked the leading indicators of what we saw. We could see [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2392.08s)]
*  our cells, we measured them by flow cytometry, we could see them sticking around in the bone marrow [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2396.7200000000003s)]
*  where they're supposed to be fighting the tumor. So we're incredibly encouraged, you know, our [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2401.76s)]
*  partner Roche also incredibly encouraged. And so that program has been continuing ever since. And [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2408.48s)]
*  what we said is we'll give at least one data update, possibly multiple data updates on that [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2414.72s)]
*  program later this year in the second half of this year. And it's been running now for, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2421.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, in the kind of doses and cohorts that are probably of most interest for over a year. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2428.3999999999996s)]
*  So by the time we give a data update on this, you know, it's going to be a very meaty one. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2434.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think we are, you know, we are going to surprise the world with, you know, hopefully a [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2439.2799999999997s)]
*  really, really interesting set of data that shows, you know, an off the shelf [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2446.56s)]
*  allogeneic CAR-T that patients do not have to wait for, that everybody can receive and that [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2452.8799999999997s)]
*  can be manufactured at scale. We're getting a hundred doses from a single patient, single batch [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2459.2799999999997s)]
*  right now, depending on what you believe about the cell dose. You know, this is not a dream. This [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2464.0s)]
*  is, you know, this is coming. So that's, you know, really put wind in our sails, as you can imagine. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2469.04s)]
*  But it's not the only program that we have in the clinic. So we've, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2478.0s)]
*  we also have a second HEAM program. This is a dual CAR-T. So sometimes we call it dual CAR-T. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2481.12s)]
*  It's really a tandem. It just has domains on one car that bind both proteins. This is not that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2490.4s)]
*  We have two full length cars in our cell, one against CD19 and one against CD20. And those are [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2496.2400000000002s)]
*  both great targets for B cell malignancies like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. So this is a program that [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2501.84s)]
*  we think would be able to be used in patients who've failed one of the commercial CD19 CAR-Ts, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2509.6s)]
*  because a lot of times that's due to antigen escape. They lose the CD19. Obviously your CAR-T [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2516.0s)]
*  doesn't work anymore, but they'll have CD20. Or you could even use it before. And it's kind of [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2521.2s)]
*  an insurance policy if the patient's tumor evolves and they do lose, you know, the CD19 over time. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2526.72s)]
*  So that program is enrolling. We'll give a data update. We haven't released any data on that [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2534.0s)]
*  program yet, but we'll give a data update on that one this year as well. And then as you mentioned, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2538.16s)]
*  we have our solid tumor program. This is against mucin 1C, which is a target expressed only on [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2542.96s)]
*  cancer cells in a range of epithelial cell malignancies. So that program, you know, we [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2552.0s)]
*  continue to enroll. We'll give a data update there also. And most recently on that program, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2559.68s)]
*  we had a poster at AACR where we showed in solid tumors, we've always known that solid tumors are [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2566.72s)]
*  a more difficult nut to crack with CAR-T than hemalignancies. We think maybe one of the reasons [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2573.52s)]
*  why is it's more difficult to get an adequate conditioning, you know, what we call lympho [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2579.52s)]
*  depletion of those patients, which is what you need. You kind of need to clear out some of the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2585.68s)]
*  immune system cells to make space or niche for the CAR-T cells to expand, you know, differentiate, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2591.44s)]
*  become the tumor killing cells that you're looking for. And so what we showed is if you go to a [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2598.96s)]
*  higher level of lympho depletion, we can get much better expansion of the cells. So we're very excited [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2605.68s)]
*  with this new learning about, you know, what we will be seeing in that program. And again, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2611.6s)]
*  we'll give a data update there. So all of that is just on the cell therapy side. At ASGCT, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2616.8s)]
*  we show that our lead gene editing program, which is for hereditary angioedema, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2624.32s)]
*  that our gene editor is probably 20 to 40 times higher fidelity than Cas-Clover, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2631.1200000000003s)]
*  which is what everybody's excited about already. So, you know, really promising technology there. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2637.6800000000003s)]
*  And we also have a non-viral program, fully non-viral program, that's a gene therapy for [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2643.84s)]
*  factor VIII, for hemophilia A. That's an area that's, you know, had some challenges with gene [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2651.6800000000003s)]
*  therapy in the past, but we think those are because those were viral gene therapy programs, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2657.28s)]
*  not non-viral gene therapy programs. And a problem that those programs have had is you don't get [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2662.7200000000003s)]
*  durable expression of the factor VIII protein, which is what you're looking for when you're [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2668.7200000000003s)]
*  treating hemophilia. Well, we showed, and this was in rodents, but we'll be moving to primates, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2673.2s)]
*  non-human primates, we showed rock steady expression of the factor VIII protein at therapeutic levels [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2678.7999999999997s)]
*  all the way through 13 months. This really surprised, you know, all of the practitioners [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2686.96s)]
*  and thought leaders who were there. So we feel like the pipeline is just, you know, it's like [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2692.08s)]
*  an embarrassment of riches. You know, everything is moving forward as we would hope. If we had [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2697.68s)]
*  more capital, we could fund more things, but we're, you know, we're focused on those things in the [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2704.7999999999997s)]
*  pipeline right now. Yeah. And the embarrassment of riches has obviously attracted the attention [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2709.7599999999998s)]
*  of companies like Roche and Astellas. That being said, you know, you don't just put out some good [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2715.8399999999997s)]
*  news and have all comers, you know, knocking down your door. So I'm hoping we can dig in a little bit [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2722.96s)]
*  into more, probably specifically the Astellas, the refresh of the Astellas deal that you've [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2730.2400000000002s)]
*  probably played more of a hand in the Roche deal was kind of pre-year time. So, and sort of how it [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2736.8s)]
*  came together. So I guess I'd just start there. Like first, what is the collaboration and tell, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2743.76s)]
*  what does the collaboration look like? And then maybe follow that up with how it came to pass. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2752.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So this is the second deal that we did with Astellas. So there was a first [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2757.9199999999996s)]
*  deal, which, you know, was a little more arm's length. So it was essentially a strategic [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2765.68s)]
*  investment on the part of Astellas into Poseida. So they got some equity, they got a board observer [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2771.04s)]
*  seat, you know, some limited rights of negotiation on a program that were time-bound. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2777.52s)]
*  So it wasn't like a real collaboration. It's still very meaningful. And we appreciated [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2783.7599999999998s)]
*  starting that relationship, but we weren't working together. But this spring we announced, you know, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2790.72s)]
*  in a way that Astellas is doubling down on Poseida, if you will, by announcing a real [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2797.04s)]
*  collaboration and license agreement. And we are really excited about this because I think it's [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2804.24s)]
*  an example of where, you know, it's not just a license of something from one company to another. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2810.7999999999997s)]
*  This is really bringing together technology from two companies that's incredibly complementary [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2817.04s)]
*  and creates the potential for new medicines that neither company would have been able to [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2823.2s)]
*  deliver on alone. So specifically, this is regarding a convertible car T. Well, what the [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2828.56s)]
*  heck is that? I like to think of it as, you know, there's the screwdrivers with the exchangeable [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2835.68s)]
*  tips. So if you think about the handle of the screwdriver, that's like the car carrying cell [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2842.48s)]
*  itself. When you've got a, you know, a car T, you know, that's the long part of the screwdrivers, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2848.32s)]
*  you know, sticking up with some binder on the end. And then the convertible tips are, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2854.64s)]
*  you know, what you swap in. So Astellas has a technology through their subsidiary Xiphos [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2862.16s)]
*  that they call Micabodies that are these interchangeable tips. So what the arrangement [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2870.56s)]
*  is, is Poseida will produce that chassis car, you know, that handle of the screwdriver, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2875.44s)]
*  and then Poseida will, or Astellas rather, will provide up to two of those interchangeable tips. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2881.6s)]
*  And what's really cool about this technology is, you know, you can, it has manufacturing [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2890.72s)]
*  advantages, right? Maybe you just, you manufacture the cell once and then you're just essentially [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2898.4s)]
*  manufacturing an antibody component. So that probably has some cost advantages, maybe some [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2902.96s)]
*  regulatory advantages, but it also opens up the possibility to go after different targets, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2908.56s)]
*  or maybe even to change targets in real time. So you could, in theory, by mass action in a patient, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2915.04s)]
*  you know, give them the car T cell, give them an initial Micabody, then maybe infuse a different [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2922.7999999999997s)]
*  Micabody later, you know, knock off the first one, and then you've kind of changed the target. Or [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2929.12s)]
*  you could give a mix of Micabodies and then maybe you have a multifunctional cell with car T's that [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2934.32s)]
*  are, you know, directed at different targets. So this is not an approach that Poseida was, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2940.48s)]
*  you know, planning to pursue. We weren't looking at a convertible car technology. And for their [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2946.8s)]
*  part, Astellas, you know, didn't have, I think they thought the right type of cell. Remember, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2953.84s)]
*  I mentioned not just any car T will do, you really want the T stem cell memory cell. So if you, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2959.76s)]
*  you know, so we're providing the allogeneic T stem cell memory car T and they're providing [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2965.92s)]
*  their convertible car tips, these Micabodies. And so this isn't solid tumors and opening up space [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2972.5600000000004s)]
*  that neither company would have been able to pursue independently. So it's really, I think, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2981.76s)]
*  a great example of a win-win. Yeah, you mentioned that it doubled down on the relationship. And [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2987.2s)]
*  I'm curious, and you're actually working together now. Like, you know, I'm curious about what that [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=2997.2799999999997s)]
*  looks like in practice. Because these partnerships take on just so many different permutations and [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3002.0s)]
*  form factors. What does working with them look like? I mean, are you, are your people like in [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3008.72s)]
*  constant contact? Are they, you know, sleeves rolled up in the lab with their people? What does [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3014.64s)]
*  it kind of look like? Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, what's great about the two companies is I [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3019.68s)]
*  think they share, you know, really a high science, you know, set of values and culture, along with [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3026.4s)]
*  the passion for patients. I would say the same is true, you know, of our partners at Roche too. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3032.0s)]
*  And that's very important because, you know, it means that the scientists get very excited to, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3037.2s)]
*  you know, to talk to each other, to work together. So, you know, even in the run-up to this, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3041.92s)]
*  you know, there was a lot of excitement. And when we, you know, we finally signed it [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3048.16s)]
*  and started to get going, you know, like from day one, you know, the scientists are talking [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3052.8s)]
*  together, they're meeting, they're charting out the plans, you know, working on selecting the [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3057.92s)]
*  targets. So, it really is a very hands-on, very fluid communication, sort of a set up. And I think [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3063.6s)]
*  that that's really important if you want to maximize speed. You know, if you're kind of [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3072.4s)]
*  shuttling communications back and forth, which is another model, you can do that, but you're going [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3079.68s)]
*  to lose a lot of time. So, I think it was really easy to get into that mode of working very well [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3085.44s)]
*  together and constant communication because we already had that previous relationship. So, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3093.68s)]
*  like I said, it wasn't an active collaboration, but we did talk to them all the time. We had standing [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3098.96s)]
*  meetings, you know, regularly once a month. So, there was already a lot of, I would say, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3103.6s)]
*  understanding of the companies mutually, a lot of trust, a lot of respect. And so, that just, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3108.56s)]
*  you know, really kick-started, I would say, you know, our ability to, you know, to work immediately [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3115.2s)]
*  out of the gate once we entered this new phase. What advice would you give to biotechs that perhaps [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3121.68s)]
*  don't have high profile or any, for that matter, partnerships with companies like Roche and [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3129.4399999999996s)]
*  Astellas, but who are, I mean, who's not interested in that, right? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3134.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3140.0s)]
*  Is it, I mean, do these things kind of, is the seed planted at events like ASGCT and AACR? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3142.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Now, I think that's where these kinds of conferences are incredibly [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3151.92s)]
*  important because everybody is there. So, you know, you will have, I mean, you'll have a lot, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3158.4s)]
*  you know, the physicians who are attending the conferences for sure, but you'll also have all [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3164.64s)]
*  the industry people there. So, you will have the scientific and medical experts, you know, from [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3168.16s)]
*  companies that might be candidates for partnering. You will also have all of their business [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3174.3199999999997s)]
*  development people and their diligence teams. And it's a different experience than just, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3180.24s)]
*  you know, finding their data later on because, you know, people have the ability to go up to [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3186.72s)]
*  the poster and ask questions, you know, of the people presenting right there. Or, you know, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3192.8s)]
*  if it's an oral presentation right after that oral presentation, they're there asking questions, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3197.92s)]
*  you know, engaging in dialogue. And sometimes very unexpected things come out of it. I mean, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3202.5600000000004s)]
*  ASGCT was probably the most recent experience for us, which was a lot of our genetic medicines [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3208.5600000000004s)]
*  work that we hadn't really shared before. And people didn't really understand [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3216.88s)]
*  how far we had advanced with those tools. We were just mocked. The poster session was supposed to be [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3220.7999999999997s)]
*  two hours long. We had different posters on different days. Every single one of them went [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3226.8799999999997s)]
*  12 to 7. And a lot of it was, you know, people from biopharma companies, large and small, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3230.8799999999997s)]
*  you know, all sizes, you know, trying to understand what we were doing. And, you know, many [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3238.3999999999996s)]
*  conversations sparking on from that afterwards, you know, we don't know if there's a way to work [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3244.7999999999997s)]
*  together here, but, you know, maybe there is. Maybe we're interested in your asset or, you know, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3249.92s)]
*  we have this technology, you have that technology, maybe they're complementary. Let's, you know, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3255.76s)]
*  let's pursue this. So there's certainly a path. It certainly is work. I don't want to say it's [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3260.0s)]
*  magically all comes together and poof. No. But I do think to your point, you know, these conferences [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3265.76s)]
*  and industry events are the perfect place to meet the right people and start that dialogue. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3273.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. What's a couple more questions and I'll respect your time. I know I'm starting to abuse [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3279.92s)]
*  it a little bit. I'm all yours, Matt. All yours. I appreciate that. What's your advice? Some advice [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3285.6s)]
*  around what not to do. Like, you know, you get the perception if you don't have something fantastic, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3293.44s)]
*  is it worth going? You know, is it worth taking that time and presenting that poster? And that [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3298.88s)]
*  could be completely wrong perception because there's opportunity for everyone. But, you know, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3303.84s)]
*  is there sort of a do you have some thoughts around like what's what's what's not a good idea [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3308.96s)]
*  if you're looking to attract partnership and perhaps use that venue as a vehicle to it? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3315.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, absolutely. You know, staying home and hoping people will come to you is probably, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3319.28s)]
*  you know, not likely to be a winning strategy because, you know, the world is a very complicated [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3325.2s)]
*  place. You know, people have to go digging for information. It's a lot easier now. We have, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3331.36s)]
*  you know, many ways of searching information that we didn't have before. But we also have a lot more [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3337.12s)]
*  information. It's a very crowded information, you know, landscape. And so, you know, hoping that, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3343.6s)]
*  you know, that the potential partners are going to just discover what you're doing, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3352.32s)]
*  not being proactive about it is, you know, I mean, it might work, but you're certainly not [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3358.72s)]
*  putting the odds in your favor, I would say. So, you know, I think interest in talking with people, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3367.92s)]
*  genuine interest in learning and it can be very open, right? Like, what are you looking for? You [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3375.7599999999998s)]
*  know, if there's not a there there, then great. You know, you have to be prepared for that [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3381.12s)]
*  conversation. But sometimes you just don't know what people are really going to be interested in [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3385.76s)]
*  or what they're going to be motivated by. And they also don't know to seek you out. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3391.44s)]
*  So, I just had one conversation comes vividly to mind where, you know, a potential partner company [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3396.7200000000003s)]
*  had been looking very much for a technology like ours, had actually made it a company mandate. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3405.36s)]
*  And they had talked to many, many companies, but they actually hadn't talked to us because, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3416.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, they just assumed maybe our dad's card was full or, you know, just hadn't come around to, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3424.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, to get to us. And it wasn't until we reached out to them, say, you know, I have no [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3431.76s)]
*  idea if you have interest in the kinds of projects that we're working on or not, that we heard, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3439.1200000000003s)]
*  oh, actually, we're looking exactly, you know, for this this type of technology and opportunity. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3444.56s)]
*  Gee, I didn't realize we hadn't talked to you before. So, you know, I think the, you know, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3451.92s)]
*  maybe it sounds a little, I don't know, trite, like, just get yourself out there. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3459.12s)]
*  But I think that is, you know, that is a part of it. And I don't think you have to have [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3464.7999999999997s)]
*  earth shattering data. You can also be a taker in of information, right? So maybe you go to the [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3470.0s)]
*  conference, you see what everybody else is doing. And maybe that sparks an idea. You know, maybe [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3475.92s)]
*  it's the missing piece for your technology that you didn't know was out there. Right? Same thing [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3480.8s)]
*  happens to us. Oh, did you know this company has this that could be, you know, really quite useful? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3486.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. What's next for you? I'm going to wrap it up [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3492.48s)]
*  here because like I said, I want to be respectful of your time. I feel like we could we could go on [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3499.36s)]
*  for another another hour. But what's next? What's next for you? What's next for Poseida in terms of [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3502.88s)]
*  business development or clinical activity? What are you most excited about right now? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3511.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's it's going to be an absolutely jam packed second half of the year for us, you know, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3515.36s)]
*  it's it's rare to be, you know, for a company to I think to have so much data coming out, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3520.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, packed into into a relatively short period of time. I mean, you know, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3526.4s)]
*  all three clinical programs, you know, we're going to give data updates. So, you know, we're very [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3531.84s)]
*  excited about that. We're gonna have an R&D day as well on the cell therapy side. We had one for [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3536.4s)]
*  genetic medicines in the spring. So, you know, you're really going to hear a lot from Poseida [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3541.6s)]
*  in the second half. So that's certainly a priority. We continue to, you know, seek interesting [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3547.52s)]
*  partnerships. We've been very clear about that. It's been our M.O. for a long time. And we would [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3555.92s)]
*  be so excited to do something in the area of genetic medicines. We have no partnerships active [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3560.64s)]
*  there, you know, right now on any of the programs. That's a, you know, an obvious area where, you know, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3567.36s)]
*  we would be thrilled to talk to people. So, you know, I think those are some of the things that [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3573.2000000000003s)]
*  are ahead in terms of what's exciting, you know, and where's my focus. You know, I am genuinely [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3579.92s)]
*  thrilled to come to work each day. I just really believe that Poseida, like I said before, is the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3586.7200000000003s)]
*  real deal and, you know, is a wonderful place to be. We say that our medicines have the capacity [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3593.44s)]
*  to cure. It's kind of on our taglines, you know, capacity to cure. And so I feel like my focus [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3602.08s)]
*  right now is really on execution and making sure that we prove that out, you know, that we continue [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3608.08s)]
*  to move these programs ahead. We deliver the data that, you know, shows the world that these [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3614.0s)]
*  medicines do indeed have the capacity to do that and that they will be the kinds of medicines that, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3620.08s)]
*  as I said, you know, are going to be available to far more patients who could benefit from them [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3626.4s)]
*  than, you know, we've been able to make available the kinds of advanced therapies that we have today. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3632.7999999999997s)]
*  So, you know, that's where you're going to find me, right here trying to make sure that that happens. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3638.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's an important differentiator. You know, I was thinking about what you said [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3644.0s)]
*  around being able to produce an allogeneic therapy that's at least as good as the autologous [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3649.04s)]
*  therapies on the market. And, you know, without that differentiator of being a company that can [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3656.4s)]
*  change the cost and accessibility paradigm in this particular space, you know, sometimes just [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3663.52s)]
*  as good as isn't good enough. But that's giant in this space, isn't it? I mean, it's just a big, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3670.32s)]
*  big deal. Yeah, that's right. I mean, today we think, you know, a very small subset of patients [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3676.48s)]
*  who could be receiving CAR Ds are actually getting them, you know, something. I mean, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3682.8s)]
*  you hear different projections anywhere from five to maybe, you know, 15 percent, but that's just in [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3686.96s)]
*  kind of very late line setting, kind of, you know, heavily pretreated patients. They've already seen [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3694.8s)]
*  lots of different lines of therapies. We now know that CAR T's have tremendous benefit, you know, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3700.4s)]
*  if used really early in disease. We've got, you know, survival data from some of the on-market [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3706.2400000000002s)]
*  products, you know, that are really demonstrating this. But we're having trouble meeting, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3711.52s)]
*  you know, manufacturing enough to meet the patient need even for the smaller patient populations in [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3717.04s)]
*  late line disease. Well, now when we clearly see that they could benefit so many patients in early [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3722.48s)]
*  line disease, you know, there's just no way to bridge that math. You have to have production [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3728.72s)]
*  at scale that's, you know, going to make enough product to serve the needs of these patients. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3736.0s)]
*  And that's just in oncology. We're all now also really very excited about the potential opportunity [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3740.64s)]
*  for cell therapy to treat various autoimmune diseases, which is another area that I'm very [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3746.8799999999997s)]
*  passionate about. It kind of comes from an autoimmune disease, you know, family. So, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3753.3599999999997s)]
*  it's, you know, some of those diseases are terrible and the therapies are also terrible. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3756.96s)]
*  So, to have a CAR T kind of one-and-done approach for patients with those diseases is also incredibly [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3761.2799999999997s)]
*  exciting. Well, let me tell you, the patient populations in those diseases dwarf the patient [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poshmDJxWbY&t=3768.4s)]
