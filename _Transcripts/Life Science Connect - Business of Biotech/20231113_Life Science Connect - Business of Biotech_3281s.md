Video Description: Earlier this year, Shawn Davis, Ph.D. left a pretty comfortable position at AstraZeneca (and Amgen before that, and Milliken – and others – before that) to lead Liberate Bio. He brought along another industry notable in Merck/Intellia alumnus Walter Strapps, Ph.D., who serves as CSO at Liberate. Why'd they do it? Because RNA delivery is such a crucial step toward revolutionary genetic medicine, but it's tough science. They think they can change that. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, Drs. Davis and Strapps share how they're applying automation and machine learning technologies to minimize the challenges associated with targeted delivery of genetic medicine and overcome the limitations of AAV. During our conversation, they both leaned hard into how their previous experiences have shaped the work they're doing, and the wide-open business opportunities Liberate Bio is creating.

# RNA Delivery Business with Liberate's Shawn Davis, Ph.D. & Walter Strapps, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4)
*  Hey, business biotechers. This is Matt Piller. And before we jump into today's episode, I have a big special announcement. On Monday, November 13th at 11 a.m. Eastern, we're taking the business of biotech live for a one hour, highly interactive web conversation with a special guest you won't want to miss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm planning a good 30 minute grilling of BlueSphere Bio CEO and biotech legal expert, Kier Loyacono, on legal and IP protection considerations for new and emerging biotechs. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=18.08s)]
*  Kier is an Esquire and a veteran biotech attorney turned CEO with a ton of experience. And when I'm done with him, I'll turn him over to a select group of viewers, you business biotechers who will have the benefit of 30 minutes of face to face Q&A and interaction with Kier and other members of the call. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=31.08s)]
*  This hour will be incredibly consultative and offer great value at no cost but your time. And it's an opportunity for some face to face virtual networking with fellow business of biotech listeners who just so happen to be the coolest cats in the business. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=51.08s)]
*  Go to the link in the show notes of today's episode to register, and I'll see you there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=68.08s)]
*  I certainly don't need to belabor the fact that nucleic acid therapy development is flourishing right now. The market is pegged at around five billion today with many projecting that figure to more than double well within the next 10 years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=76.64s)]
*  But chief among the factors that growth is predicated on is the safe and predictable delivery of those therapeutics to their targets. These are very large, very unstable molecules that require to put it in rudimentary terms, some very specialized packaging to get them to their destination in one piece and to maintain their therapeutic effect. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=90.64s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. And on today's episode of the business of biotech, I'm talking with a couple of folks who left some of the flashier names in bio pharma to form a company that would tackle this challenge head on. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=111.64s)]
*  Sean Davis was executive director of drug delivery at AstraZeneca and director of tech strategy and innovation at Amgen before that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=124.64s)]
*  Dr. Walter Straps was director of RNAi therapeutics at Merck, VP of IntelliA therapeutics and CSO at Gemini therapeutics, among others. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=134.64s)]
*  Today, Davis is CEO and Straps is CSO at LiberateBio, a company formed up just last year on the back of research by the renowned University of Pennsylvania, Professor Michael Mitchell. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=145.64s)]
*  Sean and Walter, welcome to the show. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=158.64s)]
*  Matt, thanks so much for having us. It's a fantastic opportunity to talk about what we think is the biggest challenge in the field right now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=161.64s)]
*  And so we're excited for the conversation and to convince you that you should be a drug delivery guy too. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=169.64s)]
*  I appreciate that. Hey, you know, we cover the whole gamut. So drug delivery is definitely on my table. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=174.64s)]
*  We'll talk a little bit more about why LiberateBio is a little bit of a, I wouldn't say a departure, but a stretch for the business of biotech. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=182.64s)]
*  But like you said, this being the challenge that it is, I'm all in on having this conversation about the business and the opportunity there and what you guys are going to bring to the space. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=189.64s)]
*  Thanks, Matt. I'm happy to be here as well. This is something near and dear to my heart. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=199.64s)]
*  The live working on oligos for 20 years. So getting oligos someplace other than the liver. That's the holy grail for the whole field. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=204.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And that's a good point, Walter. You know, like I said, when I first looked at you guys, I thought, well, you know, I don't see like a very specific pipeline of candidates that are biologics that would sort of be a box that I check before I invite an exec on my show. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=214.64s)]
*  But I looked into the background of both of you. And obviously your chops in this space and tackling these issues speaks for itself. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=232.64s)]
*  And this being the challenge that it is, I thought, you know, this is a great opportunity to talk about what we're doing to overcome it and how the work you guys are going to do or doing will will benefit the entire industry. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=241.64s)]
*  But I want to start with sort of the Genesis story. You know, like I said, 2022, I think Liberate was officially founded 2022. So just last year, I want to know, what's the latest on this? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=251.64s)]
*  What's the latest about about about Dr. Michael Mitchell's influence on the work and and how this thing got started? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=262.64s)]
*  Yeah. So like you said, we're just kind of coming up on the first year anniversary for the organization as a whole. And frankly, it really started with a conversation between Mike Mitchell and Ness in Birmingham. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=270.64s)]
*  And I know that some of your listeners may be familiar with Ness's work at Antelia, founder and first CEO of the organization now with Coastal Adventures. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=282.64s)]
*  And so Mike and Nesson were discussing this incredible challenge. And, you know, Mike has published extensively in the space of lipid nanoparticles and other delivery vehicles. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=290.64s)]
*  University of Pennsylvania for anyone that isn't aware and, you know, is frankly the director and group leader for their Penn Institute for RNA Innovation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=301.64s)]
*  So not only published extensively, but also really helped shape the field. And, you know, his recognition of the challenges of extra hepatic delivery, as Walter said, delivering anywhere other than liver really is foundational to unlocking the full potential of genetic medicines. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=309.64s)]
*  You know, it doesn't matter how much you optimize these nucleic acids. It doesn't matter how great your editor is. If it's not getting into the cell type that has the target, it's not doing its job. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=326.64s)]
*  So, you know, the fact that Mike not only had published extensively in the space and had a lot of fantastic ideas to move things forward, but had also created a unique way to barcode nucleic acids. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=335.64s)]
*  That serves as a key foundation for LiberateBio as a whole, because our challenge in the field is really understanding how do you innovate in the space? How do you design and create new delivery vehicles that go outside of the liver, but do it in a way that's actually efficient enough that you can go after multiple different nucleic acid cargoes, go after multiple different cell types. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=348.64s)]
*  Because solving just one of these is fantastic, unlocks a number of different targets, but frankly isn't sufficient for our patients or for the industry. And so we had to start with a concept that actually would allow us to generate the biologic data as efficiently as possible to make the company scalable and allow us to deliver on the mission of the organization. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=372.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and I'm going to ask you some questions to dig a little bit deeper into the business aspect, sort of the business proposition that Liberate brings to the industry here in just a minute. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=391.64s)]
*  But I'm curious, you mentioned Nesson and the Intellia connection. Walter, you served as VP at Intellia and Director of RNA Therapeutics. Was that sort of the connection that brought you into the fold at Liberate? Tell me how you two came together and mixed in. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=405.64s)]
*  Sure. So, yeah, so I knew Nesson from Intellia, obviously. I was the 10th employee at Intellia. I led Discovery at that organization for about three and a half years, up to the until the group was about 200 people. And so I knew Ness from that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=428.64s)]
*  And when Ness and Mike had started talking about the idea behind Liberate, the barcoding, the high throughput screening, I had actually started as an advisor to Liberate, sort of as the company was being ideated. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=445.64s)]
*  So I'm a platform guy. You know, I've worked on various oligonucleotide therapeutics and various platforms over 20 years. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=459.64s)]
*  I like problems like this, where there's an interesting technology. And then the question is, how do you turn it into something practical? How do you utilize it? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=467.64s)]
*  You know, if we even think back to CRISPR Cas9 and 2015 when Intellia was formed, it was the third of those CRISPR Cas9 companies after Editas and CRISPR Therapeutics. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=476.64s)]
*  And there was a lot of discussion right from the very beginning of, OK, here's a very powerful technology, but what can you actually do with it? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=489.64s)]
*  And so that's what the first several years of Intellia were, were figuring out practically what you can do with that technology. The same thing is true here. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=497.64s)]
*  The barcoding technology, which we can get into more details of exactly what, how that works. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=505.64s)]
*  But it allows, it opens up opportunities. But the real question is, how do you utilize it? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=510.64s)]
*  How do you leverage it to actually find the delivery vehicles that are going to get you outside of the liver? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=516.64s)]
*  And it's always a lot more work than people think it is to build a platform. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=522.64s)]
*  And building a platform itself is not the end goal. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=526.64s)]
*  Building the platform is, as I like to say, lots of conversations. It's step one. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=530.64s)]
*  A good robust platform is step one. Getting to the therapeutic is step 10. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=534.64s)]
*  But if you don't have step one solid, you're going to be in big trouble by the time you hit step three or four. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=538.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You guys are anxious to talk about the technology. I can see it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=543.64s)]
*  I'm trying to get some background, you know, get a feel for how you two met each other, how you how you worked together in the past, what brought you together? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=550.64s)]
*  And you're like, no, let's talk about the technology. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=557.64s)]
*  I mean, this is what Walter and I, when we first met and started interacting, we talked about whether or not we would work together well. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=560.64s)]
*  And we said, if anything, the problem is we're too similar and we need more diversity of thought in this company as we go forward. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=567.64s)]
*  But I have to admit, life is a heck of a lot easier when you agree on 90 percent of things and only have to really debate over the last 10 percent. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=573.64s)]
*  So we've been making fast progress at the company and we're looking forward to build out that thought process. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=580.64s)]
*  In terms of me being brought into the organization, you know, I was frankly having a fantastic time at AstraZeneca, great organization, making great progress. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=586.64s)]
*  You know, we worked on the pandemic prevention program with DARPA, you know, in this space. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=595.64s)]
*  We're working on several interesting vaccination approaches. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=600.64s)]
*  And when NASA approached me, they sent over a quick paragraph for what they were trying to accomplish. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=604.64s)]
*  And I have to admit, I read that paragraph and I thought to myself, I could have written this paragraph. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=611.64s)]
*  This is exactly where I think the world needs to go in terms of a scientific approach to this. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=617.64s)]
*  This is exactly the right problem in terms of being big enough to dedicate, you know, frankly, you know, more than five years of my sort of short lifespan to try to address. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=622.64s)]
*  So, you know, this is the kind of thing that can motivate me to leave what a role that I really relished. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=632.64s)]
*  The challenge for me was at both Amgen and AstraZeneca, and this isn't a knock on either organizations because I'm huge fans of all of their work and the folks there. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=639.64s)]
*  But pharma companies have a particular set of incentives. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=648.64s)]
*  And frankly, I bet they probably align with most of your audience's interest, which is identifying new targets and generating new molecules to address those targets. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=652.64s)]
*  And that's the right thing for them to be incentivized by. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=661.64s)]
*  Unfortunately, they are not incentivized for drug delivery, at least unfortunately for a drug delivery scientist who's been spending his whole career in this space. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=664.64s)]
*  You know, it's a great commercial differentiator in many cases for both biologics and small molecules. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=673.64s)]
*  But until you get to a class of molecules like nucleic acids, it's a nice to have, but it's not a requirement. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=678.64s)]
*  And even when it's a requirement, the organization's incentives aren't really aligned to it because they're still thinking about targets and molecules. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=686.64s)]
*  And so this is a big part of why it's so critical that we have a company like LiberiBio that is focused on the drug delivery aspects whose incentives are aligned to achieving results in that space to support partner organizations that are building those [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=693.64s)]
*  cargoes that are going after those different targets, but also to eventually do some of that work ourselves. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=708.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great segue into a couple more questions I wanted to ask about that sort of market opportunity. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=713.64s)]
*  Describe for me, either one of you wants to jump into this, describe for me what you see pre-company like LiberiBio. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=720.64s)]
*  You can talk about whether there are other companies that are intending to do what LiberiBio is doing, but like pre-concept of a company like LiberiBio, you have hundreds of nucleic acid therapeutic developers probably globally and growing in the last couple of years. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=727.64s)]
*  I'm going to say hundreds. I don't know. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=749.64s)]
*  What are they doing? Like what are they doing in terms of solving this problem across the landscape right now? Are they each individually tackling delivery mechanisms on their own, playing with some different things like, you know, whether it's, you know, viral vectors and LNPs and just like, is that sort of, is it like everybody for himself right now just kind of figuring out the delivery aspect? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=751.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, you've worked in this space longer. Yeah, go for it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=777.64s)]
*  Yeah, so no, I think that's absolutely true, right? And it sort of depends on the size of the players there as well, right? So you've got companies that are small and they have a cargo and they try to do some work on delivery, but it's by definition, it's going to be very narrowly focused. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=780.64s)]
*  You've got the other players in this space, Pharma, who actually has the resources to pursue a more dedicated chemistry program, a more dedicated delivery program. So you've got them as well and you've got a lot of interaction between those various players as well. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=796.64s)]
*  So one of the keys to this is also the size of the cargo. So I referenced SIRNA earlier. SIRNA is very, very small, especially in comparison to messenger RNA or to CRISPR-Cas9 where you've got a messenger RNA and a synthetic guide, for example, or even bigger things like the, you know, the more the next generation of gene editors, right? They're even larger than that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=811.64s)]
*  So the size of what it is that you want to deliver has a huge impact on even what delivery vehicles you can pursue. LNPs are common across all of that. So essentially, regardless of the size of your cargo, lipid nanoparticles are probably going to be able to deliver it. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=834.64s)]
*  AAV has a limitation. It has a size limitation. You can only put so much into an AAV. So you've got an upper limit there. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=850.64s)]
*  SIRNAs can be delivered by lipid nanoparticles, but actually the most success has actually been seen with conjugates from aniline where they directly attach a ligand onto that molecule. And then they don't need any other lipid nanoparticle or whatever to deliver it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=860.64s)]
*  So it's, you have to think about it as being the delivery is going to have to reflect what it is specifically that it is that you want to deliver. We're focused on LNPs because all of those cargoes can fit in a lipid nanoparticle. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=877.64s)]
*  Yeah, man. I mean, I think if you look at some of the new entrants into the space, especially in the editing space, and you look at what indications are going after, and we just made this list the other day, actually. And basically, it's not aligned specifically to where the greatest unmet need exists. It aligns to what they can accomplish. And so you see lots of liver targeting, you see tons of competition in the space, and there are some great targets and a lot of value for patients in those. But it's not a coincidence that, you know, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=894.64s)]
*  eight out of eight new organizations is going for a liver target when they're editing. It's because they're going where they can actually go. I'm an engineer by training. I'm a practical and pragmatic kind of guy. I get it. Like, if you have something that works, you should take full advantage of that. But we basically have to enable others to be able to go after all of these targets and create the same opportunity for ourselves. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=924.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So when you're forming things up, right, I mean, you could, I mean, I don't want to say it's easy, but it's easier to say, well, hey, we're going to be a development company, we're going to focus on this challenge. You know, we're scientists, we're engineers. I got a scientist and an engineer right here in front of me. Let's build a company. Let's focus on the development of a solution to this challenge. It's quite another thing to say, okay, once we feel as though we've got some legs under our solution, we're going to be able to do that. And so, you know, I think that's a great way to do it. I think that's a great way to do it. I think that's a great way to do it. I think that's a great way to do it. I think that's a great way to do it. I think that's a great way to do it. I think that's a great way to do [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=946.64s)]
*  it. I think that's a great way to do it. So I think if the technology is not a solution, let's figure out how we're going to play in this market. Let's figure out how we're going to serve as a solution provider to these development companies who could benefit from this technology, where is librate on sort of that continuum, the continuum of like, yeah, we kind of have this business model, maybe, you know, maybe we're feeling out, maybe it's mapped out, like and what's that going to look like. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=976.64s)]
*  foremost, we talked a little bit about the incentives for pharma organizations and how [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1006.64s)]
*  our incentives might be a little bit different. That also informs where we're willing to take risk [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1011.12s)]
*  and not take risk. And so, for early programs at large pharma companies, a low probability of [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1016.16s)]
*  success on a new target, a new modality makes complete sense. They've got a broad pipeline, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1022.16s)]
*  it amortizes out and works, but they take very little risk on the delivery vehicle side of things [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1026.8799999999999s)]
*  because they don't want to compound the risk on new vehicles plus new targets plus [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1031.92s)]
*  illness. It's completely rational. But if you invert that for a delivery company, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1035.8400000000001s)]
*  then it starts to inform what you're willing to do if you want to build your own pipeline and [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1040.96s)]
*  where you are and aren't willing to take risk. So I'd say that that's part of the thought process, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1045.2s)]
*  which is there are a lot of very well validated targets out there which have not been able to [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1050.0s)]
*  been addressed because of the lack of delivery vehicles. And those are great opportunities for [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1055.52s)]
*  us as a company. The second part of the consideration, I think really comes back to [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1059.76s)]
*  not just what's available, but what are you going to be capable of going forward and how do you [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1068.32s)]
*  think differently about this? And there was a really nice summary of the space from the Boston [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1075.52s)]
*  Consulting Group. I guess it was a month or so ago they published and was the coming waves of [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1079.36s)]
*  genetic medicines. And they did a nice calculation of like, you know, where are their validated [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1084.24s)]
*  targets? Who's working on them? When do we think it's possible? And they inserted a part of the [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1088.72s)]
*  calculation of how easy is it to actually accomplish the delivery? And, you know, as a delivery [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1094.4s)]
*  company, when we look at that, we'd see it completely differently because we recognize [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1099.68s)]
*  what's going to be possible when we're successful. And so when you redo that calculation, you come [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1103.52s)]
*  to quite different conclusions about where you should be partnering when there's lots of [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1108.32s)]
*  competition and there are already players ready and willing looking for that access to those [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1112.32s)]
*  molecules in areas that people didn't think were possible. And so they haven't put the time and [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1116.32s)]
*  energy into. And I think that really is going to be a productive space for us in terms of building [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1120.56s)]
*  our own pipeline in the future, driven by the ability to actually differentiate ourselves in [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1126.0s)]
*  the market with these delivery vehicles. That the final piece of the equation that has to kind of [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1130.8799999999999s)]
*  come together is what we see is commoditization of many of these nucleic acid modalities. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1136.0s)]
*  You know, the COVID-19 pandemic was devastating, but any devastating activity in history usually [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1143.28s)]
*  has some benefits that come out of it. And I would say the dramatic expansion in the number of [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1150.72s)]
*  CDMOs producing a capable of making nucleic acids, and you've got new players coming in, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1158.08s)]
*  you've got existing players, making big investments to expand their capability, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1164.96s)]
*  it's really shifted the market. I had conversations when I was at AstraZeneca about [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1169.44s)]
*  would this ever be possible to use mRNA for anything other than niche applications? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1176.56s)]
*  We were paying thousands of dollars per gram for research-grade material. We saw really no path to [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1182.32s)]
*  scale up with most of these players. And here we are with only two years of hindsight, and it's a [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1187.68s)]
*  completely different industry and supply chain. And that provides fantastic opportunities if [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1192.72s)]
*  you're controlling the differentiating factor of a delivery vehicle. Yeah, very good, very good [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1198.88s)]
*  thorough response there. And now I'm going to give you an opportunity to get into some of the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1205.1200000000001s)]
*  technology that you've been chomping at the bit to discuss. And there are words in your language [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1209.52s)]
*  that are super intriguing to me, given our coverage area, because I think there's applicability [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  in some of these words to our entire audience, drug developers and otherwise. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1222.72s)]
*  You use, and I'm going to touch on some specific words and ask you to drill into how you're [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1227.6s)]
*  leveraging these words or these technologies in your approach. Liberate is using automation, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1233.2s)]
*  in vivo high throughput screening, and machine learning to accelerate the discovery of your [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1241.36s)]
*  extra hepatic delivery vehicles. So let's talk about each of those three things individually [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1248.32s)]
*  and where they overlap. Automation, in vivo, high throughput screening, and machine learning. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1254.3999999999999s)]
*  I did a podcast, I don't know, a month or so ago with a guy, a machine learning expert, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1261.28s)]
*  AI machine learning guy, Andrew Satz. And he, I love this line. I've quoted it many times. He said, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1267.84s)]
*  machine learning and biopharma is like sex in high school. The people who say they're doing it [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1275.76s)]
*  really aren't. And those who really are, aren't talking about it. I love that. I love that. I get [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1282.6399999999999s)]
*  that, right? So start where you're like automation, in vivo, high throughput screening, and machine [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1289.52s)]
*  learning. Let's talk about each of those individually. Sure. Maybe I can give you like a big picture [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1295.2s)]
*  and then Walter can fill in the details to actually make it real for everyone to recognize that we [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1299.84s)]
*  are in fact doing something in this space. But it makes me think we need to incorporate at least [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1304.08s)]
*  one more buzzword technology to really hit like the trifecta or the bingo of investor interest. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1308.1599999999999s)]
*  So what I will say is like, let's take a big step back. And then the most basics for developing [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1315.28s)]
*  anything in the pharma space, the design, make, test, analyze cycle, if you will, DMTA. I mean, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1320.6399999999999s)]
*  it's been around for decades when it comes to small molecules. Running through that cycle allows [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1326.96s)]
*  you to come up with an idea, test to see if it works, understand the results, and then make [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1332.72s)]
*  changes. It's the scientific method in a circle, right? What we've really tried to do is look at [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1337.2s)]
*  what that cycle looks like for the development of new delivery vehicles, and then identify [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1344.08s)]
*  opportunities to accelerate every aspect of that. The DMTA cycle, it's a scientific method, it's [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1349.76s)]
*  proven, it's great. It can be very, very slow if you don't discover ways to improve the efficiency [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1356.24s)]
*  and the throughput of those discoveries, and frankly, find ways to reduce the cost so that [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1363.36s)]
*  you can scale it more efficiently. And so when we talk about automation, high throughput, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1368.16s)]
*  biologic, you know, in vivo results, talk about machine learning, those are the concepts and the [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1374.24s)]
*  tools that we're using to accelerate each one of those cycles. Walter, you want to give some [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1380.16s)]
*  details on those pieces? Yeah, and I will attempt to keep it brief because I could go for a very, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1385.36s)]
*  very long time on most of the aspects of these things. Well, I mean, some details, good Walter, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1390.56s)]
*  if you get, you know, if you go too far down into the new... Just give me the high sign if I'm going [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1395.4399999999998s)]
*  too far. So look, the overarching approach here, as Sean mentioned, is we need to get as many things [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1400.4799999999998s)]
*  into testing as we possibly can. We want those things to be novel, and we want to be able to [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1406.7199999999998s)]
*  iterate on success during this cycle. So we start at the beginning of the machine learning [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1411.84s)]
*  piece of this, right? There is a lot of work that has been done in the lipid nanoparticle space, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1418.48s)]
*  looking at identifying lipids, testing those lipids sort of one by one in vivo, in mice mostly, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1423.84s)]
*  but also in non-human primates to some extent as well. So there is a certain amount of data out [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1431.1999999999998s)]
*  there that says, these are the sorts of lipids that are going to work. These are the sort of [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1435.84s)]
*  lipids that probably aren't going to work. So if you were a rational chemist, you would start with [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1439.6s)]
*  those and you would design things that are a small iteration on the things that have been [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1446.08s)]
*  successful before. That's perfectly natural. However, if you do that, all you're really doing [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1450.0s)]
*  is moving very slightly outside of what other people have done already. So with the machine [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1455.9199999999998s)]
*  learning, the approach that we're basically taking is, okay, here is a machine learning model that [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1462.9599999999998s)]
*  says, these are the things that have worked. These are the things that haven't worked. Try something [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1467.36s)]
*  that's way out here. It's making guesses about things that might actually work for us, which is [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1472.32s)]
*  great, but it's not useful if you can't test a lot of them, because especially at the beginning of [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1477.84s)]
*  this, most of the things that a machine learning model is going to predict are not going to work. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1483.52s)]
*  They're, you know, and for various reasons, and you don't know what those reasons might be. They [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1488.24s)]
*  might be at the level of, you can't chemically synthesize the lipid that your machine learning [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1492.1599999999999s)]
*  model is predicting. You can't formulate it into a lipid nanoparticle, or even if you can, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1496.64s)]
*  maybe ultimately it simply doesn't deliver. It doesn't need what it needs to do in vivo. So you [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1501.92s)]
*  want to be able to test lots of things. The only way to test lots of things is to do it in vivo, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1506.88s)]
*  because the cell-based models that people have tried to use to predict whether or not lipid [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1512.88s)]
*  nanoparticles are going to work, they're simply not good enough. Their failure rate is too high. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1518.88s)]
*  Your rate of false negatives and false positives is simply too high. So you need to go in vivo. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1522.96s)]
*  So that's where the barcoding piece of this comes in. And what's key to this is we have a cargo, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1528.4s)]
*  a messenger RNA. It contains a barcode directly in that cargo itself. You make these as you would [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1533.6000000000001s)]
*  make any messenger RNA. Each of those individual messenger RNAs with a barcode is made into a lipid [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1540.32s)]
*  nanoparticle with the lipids that are predicted by the machine learning algorithm. You make hundreds [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1546.96s)]
*  of these. Each of them is a distinct LNP. Each of them contains a unique cargo. You take all of [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1551.76s)]
*  those LNPs, you pool them all together, and you inject them into an animal. We've done work in [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1557.68s)]
*  mice. We've also done work in non-human primates now. I could probably spend another couple hours [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1562.72s)]
*  describing why it should be NHPs, but we think NHPs are critical to this. But once you've injected [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1567.04s)]
*  that pool into the animal, you can sacrifice the animal, and then you can take all of the organs [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1572.32s)]
*  in that animal that you're interested in delivering to and look for the presence of that [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1578.0s)]
*  barcoded messenger RNA by using next generation sequencing technology. And what that tells you is [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1582.32s)]
*  I found this barcode and it is now present in skeletal muscle. And what that tells me is the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1588.24s)]
*  lipid nanoparticle that enclosed that cargo delivered to skeletal muscle. And then you say, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1594.72s)]
*  okay, and now I've done this with literally hundreds of lipid nanoparticles in a single animal. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1600.16s)]
*  These are the ones that I am now interested in. You take those structures, because you know what [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1605.68s)]
*  they are, you feed them back into your model, and your model says, oh, okay, well, if you're [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1609.68s)]
*  interested in this, try these ones. And now you're moving into the white space that other people have [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1614.8s)]
*  not looked at, chemically speaking. So it all boils down to the Liberate, our platform, the [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1620.16s)]
*  Raptor platform, is designed to test as many things as we possibly can, test them in vivo in the most [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1627.28s)]
*  relevant species, which is non-human primates, and basically iterate on that cycle as quickly [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1634.64s)]
*  as possible. Sean referenced risk. Doing it this way puts all the most of the risk at the beginning [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1640.0800000000002s)]
*  of that cycle, rather than at the end of that cycle. So you just build, you look for things [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1645.2800000000002s)]
*  that work, and you build upon the success as you go. Therapies based on messenger RNA offer many [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1650.0800000000002s)]
*  manufacturing advantages over traditional biologics, including cost, speed, and flexibility. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1658.0800000000002s)]
*  On the Business of Biotech podcast, we delve into all things related to mRNA manufacturing, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1664.64s)]
*  from making mRNA vaccines to their scale up, regulatory approval, and more. The pod is brought [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1670.0800000000002s)]

*  and accelerate the development, manufacture, and delivery of therapeutics, including mRNA production [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1681.68s)]
*  and manufacturing. Check out their resources. It's cytiva.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1687.28s)]
*  That's c-y-t-i-v-a dot com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1694.0s)]
*  And to see those things that work, I mean the barcode concept is certainly integral, central to that. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1701.44s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1708.8799999999999s)]
*  Shed some light for me on how you go about barcoding a lipid nanoparticle. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1711.76s)]
*  No, it's not the lipid nanoparticle itself that's barcoded. It's the cargo. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1720.24s)]
*  It's the cargo. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1723.9199999999998s)]
*  Yes. We have a messenger RNA, and then there's a tiny little additional piece of RNA that's part [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1724.8s)]
*  of that sequence that is the barcode. It's just a unique nucleotide sequence. And that's key to [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1729.6s)]
*  this as well. If you had to barcode the lipid nanoparticle, there are ways to do it. But again, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1735.28s)]
*  the throughput's not going to be good enough. So no, you're basically tracking the cargo. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1740.16s)]
*  And keep in mind, when we talk about delivery, we don't care about delivery. What we care about is [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1744.56s)]
*  delivering the cargo. And so we are directly tracking the cargo itself. And we know that [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1749.52s)]
*  it is present in a particular organ within a particular cell type. So it actually removes [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1755.04s)]
*  one degree of abstraction as well from that delivery piece. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1759.6s)]
*  I mean, Matt, I think you hit on a critical point there, which is, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  where are you putting this tag and what does it mean to you? Walter highlighted the differences [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1768.0s)]
*  that you see in delivery when you have different cargos. He was really highlighting what cargos [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1773.44s)]
*  fit into what kinds of vehicles. But the truth is that the size of the particle itself and the [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1778.3200000000002s)]
*  cargo and its interaction with the biology also influences its distribution and bioaccumulation. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1783.2s)]
*  And so we're being very cautious in ensuring that whatever we add to track things isn't giving us [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1789.44s)]
*  some sort of bias in a particular direction from an accumulation and expression standpoint. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1796.72s)]
*  So that's really fundamental. And there are a number of other groups that are doing barcoding [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1801.6000000000001s)]
*  approaches. And some of them are on the nanoparticle. Some of them are in the cargo. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1806.48s)]
*  Some are additional segments of DNA. Everyone has their approach. I would say that we feel [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1809.92s)]
*  very confident that our approach is not biasing the results that we're generating [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1816.48s)]
*  and ensuring that when we do conduct non-human primate studies, that we are getting the highest [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1820.4s)]
*  value out of the sacrifice from these animals, that we're conducting the most efficient [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1825.04s)]
*  experiments possible, gathering literally thousands of data points per animal to inform these models. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1829.52s)]
*  And I think your comment from your previous guest is really valuable because as all of us know, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1836.48s)]
*  and entertaining, right? Yeah, of course. I mean, that's the best combination for me. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1843.2s)]
*  Funny and smart is a great combination. So what I love about a lot of the work that's going on [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1847.44s)]
*  is you still have to go back to the fundamentals. And we've all heard the phrase garbage in, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1854.6399999999999s)]
*  garbage out. Well, the truth is until you can generate high throughput, high quality data [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1858.24s)]
*  in the right species, I would argue most of what you're putting into your models is garbage. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1864.24s)]
*  It's published garbage, it's patented garbage, but it's garbage in quotes because it has bias [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1869.44s)]
*  in what's being published. It has bias in that it's almost all in rodents. And so I'm not sure [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1876.16s)]
*  about the translatability. It has bias in that it's almost all in the liver because that's what [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1880.56s)]
*  most people have the access to. So how good of a model could we possibly build if we only looked [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1884.64s)]
*  at rodent data in the liver that's been published? Frankly, not very good. And so closing that [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1891.04s)]
*  learning loop for the algorithm, allowing it to make predictions, allowing, you know, synthesizing [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1897.84s)]
*  the material, testing it, and then going back and saying, you know what, that was a terrible [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1903.36s)]
*  prediction. You know, here's how it actually played out and closing that loop is critical [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1906.8799999999999s)]
*  to the long-term building of the model. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1911.6s)]
*  Can I just, I'd just like to give one more example if I could. So one of the things that we did is [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1915.12s)]
*  we were setting up our platform was pull lipids from the literature. So that had been published [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1918.8s)]
*  in papers or had been published in patents that had demonstrated delivery of cargo to specific [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1924.8s)]
*  organs within a mouse, for example. But what we did was take our barcoding approach and our [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1929.9199999999998s)]
*  approach of looking at all of the organs within those animals. So even where these lipids and [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1935.36s)]
*  these lipid nanoparticles had been published and having known tropism, as in they went to a specific [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1940.56s)]
*  organ, because we actually looked at all of the organs, we actually found tropisms. We found the [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1946.08s)]
*  delivery of these published things going to organs that were not reported upon because no one had [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1951.1999999999998s)]
*  looked there. So that's sort of like, as we, as we're doing, starting to build out our novel set [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1956.08s)]
*  of lipids and testing them, because we're taking a very broad approach, you know, not a focused [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1961.6s)]
*  spotlight, but you know, a much more broad swath of things, we're going to find things that others [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1966.8799999999999s)]
*  literally have already missed. So we have a great confidence that we're going to find more things as [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1974.2399999999998s)]
*  we go forward here as well. Yeah. The testing that's taking place right now, like just to [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1979.36s)]
*  break it down into its simplest form, you're analyzing via this barcoding technology, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1986.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, where the car, where these cargos are ending up. The cargo itself, is this something [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1992.7199999999998s)]
*  you guys are doing internally on your own? Are you partnering with companies, you know, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=1999.12s)]
*  developers of those cargos to do this testing? Like what's, what's sort of that? Can you share [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2003.76s)]
*  that? Like who you might be partnering with or whether you're doing it on your own? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2009.52s)]
*  Yeah, so far, I mean, Walter gave a great description of our building of a platform. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2014.48s)]
*  And inevitably, when you build a platform, you want to start with a solid basis that you can [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2020.3200000000002s)]
*  trust and then expand out once you understand that. So we've been referencing lipid nanoparticles [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2024.8s)]
*  almost exclusively so far. We don't think the process is limited to lipid nanoparticles. One [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2030.16s)]
*  of our founders, Teresa Reinike, is a real expert when it comes to polymeric nanoparticles. And so [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2035.28s)]
*  we may, we will expand into that space. The cargos themselves, we've been working almost exclusively [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2040.24s)]
*  with mRNA today that we've had produced by CDMOs. As I described earlier, it's easily accessible. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2046.5600000000002s)]
*  We can go out there. We're making a, you know, pretty traditional luciferase, you know, mRNAs [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2053.28s)]
*  encoding for luciferase so that we can understand not just the bioaccumulation, but also the [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2058.64s)]
*  expression of these materials. We're expanding into other modalities very rapidly, not only because [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2062.96s)]
*  it addresses some protocol challenges in terms of the timing of the experiments, but also demonstrates [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2069.8399999999997s)]
*  the breadth of capability for the platform. And so when you start with that core understanding [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2075.2799999999997s)]
*  of your design space, and then slowly start edging it out and building things out further [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2080.16s)]
*  and further, you get to a point where you have a large number of different cargos that have been [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2084.48s)]
*  demonstrated in the platform. You have a large number of different compositions of those [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2089.04s)]
*  nanoparticles and a really robust design space to work with. So I hope that addresses your question [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2093.76s)]
*  that today we're primarily focused on mRNA produced by CDMOs. Our expectation going forward once we [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2099.76s)]
*  make some of these discoveries on the delivery vehicles is that we will be partnering with [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2106.08s)]
*  organizations that have existing cargos that they want to deliver, as well as developing our own [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2110.24s)]
*  cargos going forward. Yeah, yeah. I've got some questions for you around that too, the development [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2115.3599999999997s)]
*  of your own cargos. But before we move on to that, the technology itself, the platform technologies [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2120.64s)]
*  that you're developing, the infrastructure, if you will, that's supporting automation and machine [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2127.2s)]
*  learning and high throughput screening. Is this stuff that is sort of inherent to the team that [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2132.88s)]
*  you put together and you've built internally? Or are you working with outside computational [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2140.32s)]
*  folks and IT folks? What's gone into the development and building of that tech infrastructure? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2149.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's certainly something we're continuing to build out. We're a very young organization. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2157.68s)]
*  We're operating very leanly. We're looking forward to expanding in all of these spaces. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2163.68s)]
*  But core to the concept, and I would say a differentiator for us relative to some other [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2168.0s)]
*  players in this space, is that diversity of talent sets. So we started by bringing in [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2172.64s)]
*  one of the post-docs from Mike's lab in order to ensure that we could make an efficient translation [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2179.8399999999997s)]
*  of the barcoding concept from his lab into our more industrial setting. Then building out the [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2184.72s)]
*  biology team under Walter's expertise to cover what's necessary from a sequencing standpoint [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2191.04s)]
*  is in vivo studies. And then one of our other co-founders, Steven Scully, a former Intellia [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2197.2s)]
*  employee also, really strong on the chemistry side and frankly got a lot of this up and going. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2202.7999999999997s)]
*  One of the first people on the ground that actually did the hiring to find these folks [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2207.8399999999997s)]
*  brought in the formulation experience to complement that. And so it's sort of the barcoding, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2212.4s)]
*  then the formulation and creation of the lipid nanoparticles coming together. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2218.2400000000002s)]
*  And then about six months ago, we brought in a former head of computational science from a [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2222.0s)]
*  couple of organizations, Paraminder Manku, who is helping us build out our actual algorithms. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2226.56s)]
*  And so she's been making incredible progress, driving the activity along with some vendors [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2232.08s)]
*  to build out a complimentary set of these algorithms. And so it's the fact that we've [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2238.48s)]
*  got a team with all of these unique core strengths coming together and frankly, debating [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2242.5600000000004s)]
*  slash fighting over what the right balance between some of these competing interests will be is [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2248.1600000000003s)]
*  making the company grow faster and helping us to understand what direction we should go. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2254.32s)]
*  And when the computational folks generate a million different structures for you to go and [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2259.0400000000004s)]
*  synthesize, then it makes for a really fun conversation with the chemist about how in [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2265.28s)]
*  the world you're going to synthesize a million different structures. And when the chemist figure [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2268.88s)]
*  out how to make things really efficiently, then all the pressure shifts over to Walter to figure [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2274.6400000000003s)]
*  out how in the world he's going to test all of those materials. And so each one of those bottlenecks [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2278.0s)]
*  as we break through it just pushes the next team to go even further and has been really exciting [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2282.1600000000003s)]
*  to watch over the last 12 months. As Sean mentioned, we're a small organization, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2286.96s)]
*  right? So the approach that we've taken is where we need very tight control over what it is that [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2292.24s)]
*  we're doing, we have that in-house. Where we need stuff and we can outsource it, we've been [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2299.2799999999997s)]
*  outsourcing it. So again, I think Sean and I are relative on the conservative end of things in [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2305.04s)]
*  terms of the building of an organization, probably in other ways as well. But just in terms of we [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2310.72s)]
*  want to make sure that we have what we need in-house, but we're utilizing, there's a massive [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2316.3199999999997s)]
*  plethora of CROs in all of these spaces. We're utilizing that wherever we can. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2322.3199999999997s)]
*  If and when we reach the point where a particular capability we feel it needs to be in-house, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2327.3599999999997s)]
*  we'll build it in-house. But we're taking the approach of really identifying where the gaps [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2331.9199999999996s)]
*  will be, filling the gaps outside if we can, filling them inside when we need. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2337.68s)]
*  Sean, I'm just loving when you get described as conservative when you're working in biotech in [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2341.12s)]
*  Boston and startup organizations where you're like staring into the abyss of finding funding [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2348.88s)]
*  when you move your family up from another state to take things on. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2354.4s)]
*  Sean, everything is a relative concept though, Sean. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2359.04s)]
*  I know. Only in this industry are we the conservative ones. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2361.28s)]
*  State or country, Walter, I'm picking up some Canadian. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2366.32s)]
*  Oh, well, that's pretty good. Yeah, no, it's funny. That usually comes up in the first five [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2369.52s)]
*  minutes or so of a conversation with me. Yeah, no, I'm actually from Nova Scotia, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2373.84s)]
*  born and raised in Nova Scotia. So yeah, I moved to go to graduate school. I moved in, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2378.1600000000003s)]
*  well, I won't say when, a long time ago. It'll date me too much, but yes. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2385.28s)]
*  Yeah. Well, speaking of geography, so you guys are, you're both in Boston, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2390.1600000000003s)]
*  you both live and work in Boston. Michael obviously is up in Philadelphia, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2395.04s)]
*  and Philadelphia is laying claim to Cell and Gene Therapy 3.0, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2402.08s)]
*  presenting themselves as sort of the hub for that. What's your take on like, to whatever degree it [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2409.92s)]
*  matters these days, what's your take on sort of the geographic sort of proximity between what's [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2418.24s)]
*  going on in Philly and all that IP and subject matter expertise there, and what's been going [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2422.64s)]
*  on in Boston where you guys are? That's an interesting question, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2430.64s)]
*  Matt. I would say, so I've had the benefit of living, frankly, all over the world and all [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2434.48s)]
*  over the US, both in my childhood and in my career. And, you know, it's quite a different world post [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2441.2s)]
*  COVID-19 in terms of your ability to communicate and get things done across vast spaces, right? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2448.24s)]
*  I don't need to explain that to your audience. But I would say that no matter where I go, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2453.2799999999997s)]
*  when I return to the Boston, Cambridge, US area, and I step out of a hotel room into, you know, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2459.36s)]
*  Kendall Square, the energy I feel is like nothing I've experienced anywhere else. You can see, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2468.2400000000002s)]
*  I guess you can't physically see, but I feel the energy of the ideas, you see people looking to [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2477.6s)]
*  collaborate, you see the desire and frankly, the capital to pursue new ideas that is so different [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2483.52s)]
*  from what I've experienced anywhere else that I've been. And so when I was ready to return to the [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2491.28s)]
*  startup space after a decade away with Big Pharma, it was the only place that made sense to me. And, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2497.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, any startup, look, I'm very confident and liberate any startup as a high risk proposition [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2503.28s)]
*  in relative to many other opportunities. But when I wanted to come back to the space, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2509.12s)]
*  I knew the only place to do it was in the Boston, Cambridge area, because of the ideas, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2513.6800000000003s)]
*  because of the capital, because of the people. And so I am incredibly respectful of what's going on [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2518.6400000000003s)]
*  in Pennsylvania and Mike's work and you Penn's work. And I love that we can have these centers [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2524.4s)]
*  throughout the world. But at the end of the day, this is the place I think you need to be if you [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2530.08s)]
*  want to get a lot of these things done. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2534.4s)]
*  And I just want to emphasize the pool of talent piece of this, right? So, you know, obviously [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2537.2000000000003s)]
*  you're interviewing Sean and Sean and I, right? And we're C-level executives at the company. But [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2540.96s)]
*  the fact of the matter is the company is really the people who are doing the work day to day, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2546.8s)]
*  that's the pool of talent that you're drawing on within within Boston itself. You cannot underestimate [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2551.36s)]
*  that. I mean, we've got people at our company who actually who have more years of experience than [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2556.56s)]
*  Sean or I working in biopharma. And they know how to do things as well. They, you know, do things [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2561.04s)]
*  internally and outsource things as well. So, you know, it's one of those things where there's a [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2566.56s)]
*  critical mass of multiple different things. But the, I really like the team that you put together [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2570.8s)]
*  to launch a venture like we've launched with liberate is critical because every employee, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2577.12s)]
*  you know, when we're 14, 15 people, every employee is a massive part of what it is that we're doing. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2582.24s)]
*  You can really only find that critical mass, I would argue in Boston. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2588.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's the talent pool, but it's the culture too, right? Like you can have a lot of [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2591.92s)]
*  really experienced folks that aren't willing to listen to new ideas and to try to think about [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2595.92s)]
*  things differently and discover a new approach to things. And, you know, the first time something [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2601.04s)]
*  goes wrong, defaulting back to the original approach as Walter said to me the other day. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2605.44s)]
*  And I don't think that's, I mean, there aren't that many places where people are so open-minded [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2610.4s)]
*  and willing to try different things and just go out on a limb and see if it works and really [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2615.68s)]
*  follow the science. And, you know, when we talked about automating things, you know, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2619.6s)]
*  there's automating physical activities, but I really think of some of the artificial intelligence [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2624.3199999999997s)]
*  work that's going on is automating the hypothesis generation. It's creating new ideas for you to go [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2628.3999999999996s)]
*  and follow up on and seeing, you know, we have a fantastic chemists on staff. And I remember [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2634.3999999999996s)]
*  as the first chemistry was coming out of the model, he's like, boy, this is just garbage. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2641.2799999999997s)]
*  Like I can never make this stuff. Like, well, what are these structures? And then a few weeks [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2645.92s)]
*  later, he's like, actually, there's some interesting stuff in here. This could be really good. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2650.16s)]
*  And then flash forward a couple of months later, and he's like, this is like having another [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2653.52s)]
*  fantastic chemist creating wild ideas. And yeah, some of them are crazy and probably not going to [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2657.2s)]
*  work, but some of these things are looking really good. We need to make these things and figure out [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2663.7599999999998s)]
*  how it works. And so, you know, finding talent that has that sort of open-mindedness and that [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2667.6s)]
*  willingness to try new concepts is unique. And, you know, I love the fact that there's this core [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2672.7200000000003s)]
*  in the Cambridge Boston area, but I also love that I can take advantage of those people, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2680.2400000000002s)]
*  no matter where they are in the world right now. If you find that talent in Singapore, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2684.8s)]
*  let's sign them up. Let's get her on board and have her contribute tomorrow. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2689.76s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. Yeah. No, I like that. I like that, you know, the time and exposure that sort of analogy [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2694.48s)]
*  you made about your chemists embracing some of these ideas, even if those ideas are not being [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2700.8s)]
*  generated at the bench where they're, you know, where they grew up and they're so comfortable. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2706.96s)]
*  I've talked to many a biotech exec who, when asked about sort of that marriage of computational and [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2710.88s)]
*  chemistry or biology, they say, well, you know what, it's proximity and time. We put those teams [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2717.04s)]
*  in close proximity and let them work until they become friends, until they understand [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2723.12s)]
*  one another and can make good things happen. Yeah. I think that's right. And Boston is a great [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2728.64s)]
*  place to do that. I would argue, Sean, you were saying, you know, I don't know, you're saying, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2734.0s)]
*  you know, you can see it and you're like, I don't know if you can see it. Well, I live in a very [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2737.04s)]
*  rural corner of Pennsylvania, opposite corner from Philadelphia. And when I come to Boston, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2740.88s)]
*  I can definitely see it. Like, you know, I think it is palpable, it's visual, it's, you know, it's [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2746.64s)]
*  in the air. So no shame in your unabashed love for Boston. We're running short on time, guys. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2752.0s)]
*  But I want to get to some questions about that possible, maybe someday pipeline. As I said, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2761.84s)]
*  from the outside of this conversation, you know, I was like, I don't know, these guys don't look [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2771.04s)]
*  like they kind of hint, like their language, you know, the language on the site and the [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2773.84s)]
*  promotion line kind of hints at maybe, you know, a pipeline down the road. And I'm not going to pin [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2779.2s)]
*  you down on that, obviously. But what does, and I'm quoting from your language, a hybrid business [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2785.7599999999998s)]
*  model with an internal pipeline and partnered programs look like? I want to know what that [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2792.96s)]
*  looks like. And then I want to know, you know, whether or not there's the potential for a [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2797.9199999999996s)]
*  pipeline and what, when you have a cargo, these are the compound questions that I'm famous for [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2802.4s)]
*  asking. When you have a cargo and you have a delivery vehicle and both are equally integral [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2810.0s)]
*  to the success, the potential success of a therapeutic and, you know, you're in a partner [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2820.08s)]
*  program. I'm curious about what that looks like from a product ownership standpoint. Like, what's, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2825.76s)]
*  you know, what's the goods, what's the real goods, who owns it? What's that kind of look like? So [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2831.68s)]
*  a whole bunch of questions there in the short time that we have left, pick an angle, pick one of those [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  facets of the multi-point question I just asked and let me know what you think. Yeah, let's see how [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2843.6s)]
*  complete of an answer I can give you. For me, you know, it starts with, if you're building a business, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2849.3599999999997s)]
*  you need to build a business, in my opinion, that generates confidence and credible results [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2855.6s)]
*  and ultimately revenue in a staged fashion. And so that means identifying early opportunities that [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2862.64s)]
*  will basically get you in the clinic, confirm that you've got something that's valuable, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2869.8399999999997s)]
*  and generate revenue to support the future growth of the organization. And so a partnership type [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2875.6s)]
*  of model in which you have a number of big players in the space that have identified targets, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2882.24s)]
*  that have cargos that they want to deliver, but don't have the right vehicle to make that happen, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2887.8399999999997s)]
*  provide a fantastic opportunity for us to work together with them to create a therapeutic product [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2892.3999999999996s)]
*  that delivers patient value, delivers commercial value for them and for us. And in that, let me [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2897.8399999999997s)]
*  just interrupt you real quick, Sean. In that scenario, the clinical responsibility and the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2903.68s)]
*  regulatory responsibility lies with the therapeutic, the cargo developer, correct? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2910.16s)]
*  No question. Yeah. I mean, I think you see exactly, I mean, you can use what happened in the COVID-19 [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2916.3999999999996s)]
*  vaccine space as an example of how that can play out, where you have suppliers providing the lipid [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2921.52s)]
*  nanoparticle structures and the chemistry being licensed into a parent organization that has [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2928.16s)]
*  created the vaccine itself, the two of them to come together. There's a split of royalties. There's, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2933.92s)]
*  payments exchanged in order to move that forward. But at the end of the day, it's Pfizer's vaccine. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2940.0800000000004s)]
*  And that's always going to be the case when you control the therapeutic modality, right? That's [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2945.5200000000004s)]
*  the primary mechanism of action. I don't think there can be any question about that. And so, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2949.5200000000004s)]
*  I think that is the near term path, but it also, frankly, and can be quite, I think, a valuable [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2955.2000000000003s)]
*  path for the company as a whole, but it is the near term path that we will build on. I would say [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2962.48s)]
*  the mid-range to longer range path is one in which we are creating our own internal pipeline [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2967.68s)]
*  based on the fact that many of these cargos have become commoditized and that we could have produced [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2973.6s)]
*  without stepping on intellectual property or having to build out our own manufacturing [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2979.52s)]
*  capability in the nucleic acid space. You can just look at, frankly, the number of failed trials [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2985.04s)]
*  in some of the genetic medicine space where you see that you have a well-validated target, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2992.08s)]
*  and you recognize what intervention you want to make, but without the appropriate delivery vehicle, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=2998.08s)]
*  they either don't get the results they're looking for from a safety standpoint, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3003.76s)]
*  or they get the efficacy they want, but the tox and tolerability and immune response isn't acceptable. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3007.44s)]
*  I think those are fantastic opportunities for us to build on and go back and cure some of those [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3014.08s)]
*  issues. That's how that could play out. Certainly in that case, then we are owning the full [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3018.64s)]
*  therapeutic. You are seeing the lion's share of revenue concentrated in the company, and it is a [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3024.08s)]
*  way for us to progressively build value in the organization for ourselves over time and for [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3029.44s)]
*  patients. There's a lot of talk about speed in the market from a commercial standpoint, but I think [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3034.48s)]
*  we have to remind ourselves that our goal is to serve patients, and speed to market first and [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3041.8399999999997s)]
*  foremost means earlier access for patients to therapeutics that don't exist today. We talk a [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3046.48s)]
*  lot about speed and efficiency to make sure that we're providing what we need, but that's all [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3052.72s)]
*  underpinned by our desire to ensure that the thousands of diseases that are going untreated [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3058.16s)]
*  today in this space could be addressed, and we do that as quickly as possible. That's our view on [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3063.84s)]
*  how to build a hybrid or bifurcated business model around this. Tanner Iskra And I like it. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3069.84s)]
*  Any hints or will you not touch this question with a 10-foot pole down the line, you know, saying, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3076.72s)]
*  even if it's just an inspiration, like something that inspires you personally, any hints or thoughts [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3086.48s)]
*  on what targets or indications an internal liberate pipeline might address or I mean, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3092.88s)]
*  you could say no or yes, but I'm not willing to share. That's fine. I'm just- [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3103.28s)]
*  Maybe what I'll say is, you know, when you're building a platform that you hope can deliver [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3108.7200000000003s)]
*  to any cell type in the future, you still have to identify a few initial cell types that are your [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3114.48s)]
*  priorities to set your protocols, to set your assays, and we have done that. I would say that [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3120.48s)]
*  there's so much unmet need out there. It's actually a problem. It's not a value problem, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3127.44s)]
*  right? Like you map what's valuable and there are so many things, you can't put them all on a single [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3132.7200000000003s)]
*  slide. So then you start thinking about, well, what's actually scientifically tractable in the [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3137.92s)]
*  near future for us to focus on earlier? And, you know, clearly the, there are some cell types that [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3142.64s)]
*  are more likely to have amenable solutions earlier than others that also have a lot of value. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3148.56s)]
*  Maybe we won't get in the details on the podcast, but anyone that's interested in [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3154.56s)]
*  chatting about this, we can certainly have a conversation and give you our thinking about [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3159.04s)]
*  the directions it could go. Yeah, fair enough. Fair enough. You guys are a ton of fun to talk to. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnKVzeWiTc4&t=3163.1200000000003s)]
