# Biotech C-Suite Construction With Allan Shaw
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [October 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE)
*  It's been a hot minute since we've sat down for a jam session with everyone's favorite [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=0.0s)]
*  biotech finance guru, Alan Shaw, but that changes today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=9.08s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=13.88s)]
*  This is the Business of Biotech. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=14.88s)]
*  And on today's show, Alan and I are going to be talking about biotech leadership, planning [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=16.64s)]
*  and strategy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=22.3s)]
*  And while there's never a bad time to be plotting out your next C-suite talent moves, it's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  a particularly timely talk right now as stubborn scrutiny and volatility continue to harshly [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=29.98s)]
*  persecute biotech management missteps that would have likely been handily forgiven just [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=36.66s)]
*  a few years ago. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=42.14s)]
*  Executive teams in biotech are a study in evolution. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=44.7s)]
*  They come together over time and with intention. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=47.68s)]
*  Getting caught without the right people in the right seats at the right times can be [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  but so can putting those people in those seats. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=56.44s)]
*  On today's episode, I'll interrogate Alan's wisdom gained over a decades-long career in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=60.8s)]
*  which he's been both a strategic hirer and a strategic hire. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=66.62s)]
*  Alan, it's good to see you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  Great to see you, Matt. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=74.28s)]
*  Hope things are all well and always a pleasure to get together for one of these sessions. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=75.88s)]
*  It sure is. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=80.58s)]
*  Yeah, this one's overdue. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=81.58s)]
*  We need to get our cadence back into a more regular fashion, I think. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=83.74s)]
*  I'm happy to do so. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  And as we head into the fall, this is a great time to do it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=93.38s)]
*  Sure is. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=97.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=98.94s)]
*  So I want to start out with the danger zone. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=99.94s)]
*  I want to start out with a discussion around the dangers in poorly metered hiring moves. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  I asked this with the backdrop of some context. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=113.22s)]
*  I've been reading on the airwaves some of the forums out there, the reflection on some [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  of the companies that have fallen on hard times of late and let a lot of people go. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=128.06s)]
*  And I often see finger pointing around executive hiring strategy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=135.62s)]
*  I don't know how much of that is bluster, how much of it's true. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=141.26s)]
*  But from your perspective, what are some of the dangers that lurk in poorly metered hiring decisions? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=145.22s)]
*  You know, certainly given where we are as an industry, it's certainly always a good [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=156.7s)]
*  time to kind of reflect and take stock on what works, what doesn't work. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=161.54s)]
*  I guess it's also important to internalize that one size doesn't fit all. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  But these are general guidelines and practices. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=172.82s)]
*  I think generally speaking, you do want to be early than late when you bring resources [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=176.38s)]
*  on board. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=182.26s)]
*  But you have to be thoughtful about it too. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=183.74s)]
*  If you bring in an elephant and there's only a few mice, the elephant isn't going to stick [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  around. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=192.46s)]
*  It's not going to be interesting enough. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=193.46s)]
*  So, you know, it really depends on where the organization is and how the organization evolves. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=194.58s)]
*  I think going back to, you know, your specific question, I'd call out a couple of areas to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=200.18s)]
*  talk about and focus on. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=208.78s)]
*  One is certainly I think there's inevitably blind spots in decision making. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  And I think a lot of decisions many times are fear driven as well, based on insecurity [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=216.62s)]
*  or the perception that they should be doing something. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=223.18s)]
*  You know, one major risk is that people often know what they know, but they don't always [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=225.5s)]
*  recognize what they don't know. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=230.66s)]
*  And these are important blind spots. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=233.82s)]
*  And you know, I think being able to expand around that and get input from others help, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=236.94s)]
*  you know, talking to the board, thinking of talking to your organization, thinking about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=243.98s)]
*  what you really need is important and understanding the implications to your culture as you do [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  it as well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  I think there's also fear driven decisions in the absence of good information. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=255.18s)]
*  Fear and insecurity can drive poor decisions. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=260.18s)]
*  This often manifests in hiring decisions based on perceived expectations rather than the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=262.86s)]
*  actual needs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=267.82s)]
*  And I think as people think about, you know, for example, you know, that they have aspirations [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=270.54s)]
*  for it to be public at some point in time. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=275.06s)]
*  You know, they have certain concerns about where they are relative to where they should [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  be from an organizational perspective. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=283.54s)]
*  So those are some of the things to be mindful of as you think about it and often can lead [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=285.92s)]
*  to bad decisions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=291.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  Where does that just to follow up to that one, where do you see that pressure coming [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=294.02000000000004s)]
*  from like in fear driven decisions? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=297.68s)]
*  You know, you talked about perceived expectations rather than actual needs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=300.18s)]
*  Is that sort of a, you know, is it a shareholder, a perceived shareholder pressure, board level [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=304.26s)]
*  pressure and investor level? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  Like where's that pressure coming from? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  I think it's probably the end point is what's driving that, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=315.98s)]
*  If you're looking to be a public company and you're looking to be a public company, you [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=320.68s)]
*  know, over the next year and, you know, that's that's somewhat bold given the fact that it's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=326.98s)]
*  been very hard to go public. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=332.06s)]
*  But, you know, from my perspective, I think that's a really realistic expectation with [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=333.64s)]
*  interest rates starting to come down now with the election behind us in short time. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=337.76s)]
*  I think, you know, it's going to be much more fertile. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=345.24s)]
*  And I think there are a lot of organizations that have done crossovers and are ready to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=348.3s)]
*  go that are just sitting on the runway. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=352.76s)]
*  So I think as that starts to open up, I think IPO aspirations are very real. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=355.2s)]
*  And I think there's then a level of expectation that when the company is ready to go, when [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=361.72s)]
*  the window is open, that you're ready to go. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=367.56s)]
*  Right. And that leads to, you know, starting your car and letting the engine run for a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=369.76000000000005s)]
*  while. So, you know, you need to gauge a little bit of, you know, the pathway that you need [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  to go. You know, usually you do a crossover round and there's steps along the way. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=379.64000000000004s)]
*  And as you move along the way, you need to I guess there's an investor expectation that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=384.72s)]
*  you have your house in order and that you can do things. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=391.5s)]
*  And again, given the emphasis on on determining whether or not you even have a business, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=394.66s)]
*  right? You know, you need to kind of get answers scientifically. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=400.62s)]
*  I think it gets people into a position. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=403.86s)]
*  Well, when do we start building the rest of the organization? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=406.9s)]
*  And I think that's where some of those and where the anxiety comes from. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=411.82s)]
*  And it's good anxiety because directionally they are correct. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=418.46000000000004s)]
*  But, you know, there's a lot of steps in the way in terms of how you stage your [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  organizational build out. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=427.1s)]
*  And, you know, I don't know if it necessarily has to be the immaculate conception. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=428.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=433.42s)]
*  I when I when I asked that first question, I was sort of dancing around, you know, this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=435.3s)]
*  idea that when when companies fall on financial hard times, a lot of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=440.9s)]
*  finger pointing starts starts happening around the executive leadership team. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  And an example that strikes me like right right now, I mean, this this episode will [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=452.5s)]
*  drop a few weeks from now. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=457.38s)]
*  But like in the moment that we're in right now, a few weeks ago, I had Rahul Kikar on [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=459.73999999999995s)]
*  the podcast. He's the CEO at Tome. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=466.73999999999995s)]
*  And Tome Biosciences, they, you know, raised a couple hundred million dollars, I think, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=469.34s)]
*  last spring. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=474.62s)]
*  They're they're in a tough spot right now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=476.06s)]
*  They made an acquisition. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=477.74s)]
*  They spent a lot of money on a company recently, but they're in a tough spot financially [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=478.94s)]
*  right now. And there's you know, they're dealing with those consequences. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=483.3s)]
*  They just let a whole bunch of people go. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=486.58s)]
*  They got some some bad press. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=487.86s)]
*  And when you read into the weeds, you know, you start reading the commentary on the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  forums from industry observers, you know, shareholders, even even biotech employees. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=493.18s)]
*  A lot of finger pointing happens like, oh, look at all the money they're spending on [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=498.98s)]
*  their executive leadership team, you know, and I go, well, you know, I don't know. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=502.42s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to contribute mightily to the, you know, the downward [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=507.58000000000004s)]
*  spiral of a of a 200 plus million dollar funded company. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=513.78s)]
*  But you tell me, like, I'm curious about that. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=517.9s)]
*  Do you do you I mean, do you think that overzealous spending on high dollar, you [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=520.58s)]
*  know, sea level leadership can or does contribute to, you know, the runway running [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=525.1s)]
*  short and why or why not? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=530.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's you know, it's certainly an interesting question. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=533.7s)]
*  And certainly I've seen criticism like that attributed elsewhere. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=537.3000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I think when things aren't going well, right, people, I think the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=544.4200000000001s)]
*  salaries that compensation that executives of troubled companies receive becomes a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=549.74s)]
*  little bit of a lightning rod. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=555.9s)]
*  And I think and I get that, but I also would call out in this industry where [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=558.74s)]
*  there's a lot of industrial jeopardies and binary risks that, you know, it's, you [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=563.9s)]
*  know, a company could be well run and still have issues like that at the end of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=569.1s)]
*  the day. But it's certainly easy to be a Monday morning quarterback and criticize [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=576.58s)]
*  people after the fact. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=581.46s)]
*  If everything was going good, no one would have a problem. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=583.22s)]
*  And then then it becomes a decision of whether or not those people should be [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=585.6600000000001s)]
*  retained or not. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=588.7s)]
*  It's not whether or not they should be getting paid. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=590.0600000000001s)]
*  Everyone should be getting paid. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=592.1s)]
*  But whether or not those were really the right hiring decisions, whether they were [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=594.86s)]
*  the right fits, you know, there's other questions to be asked as opposed to how [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=598.0200000000001s)]
*  much money they're necessarily making. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=602.18s)]
*  In my view, you know, leadership versus resource allocation, you know, I mean, I'm [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=605.2199999999999s)]
*  not sure if it really works that way. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=611.78s)]
*  You know, I think building out a C level leadership doesn't automatically lead to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=614.38s)]
*  running out of money, but it certainly ties into how an organization prioritize and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=618.62s)]
*  allocates its resources. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=623.78s)]
*  And you shouldn't be, you know, and I think it talks about fit and also talks about [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=627.06s)]
*  the kind of person that you want in your organization. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=631.7s)]
*  You know, right. I think a lot of us are generally. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=634.98s)]
*  Working, you know, to make an impact and the benefits associated with making that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=639.7800000000001s)]
*  impact would will result in wealth creation. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=645.5s)]
*  You know, the salaries pay our bills at the end of the day, you know, it's a punch [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=649.62s)]
*  in the clock. So, you know, and what I've often marbled is that when you see [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=654.0600000000001s)]
*  companies that are broken companies that are reverse merger candidates, you know, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=659.9s)]
*  it asks the question, why are these people sticking around? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=666.06s)]
*  The equity isn't worth anything, you know, and those people are probably the wrong [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=668.66s)]
*  cast in the wrong roles because they're very happy just collecting their cash and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=673.5s)]
*  they're not looking to, you know, move the needle at the end of the day. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=677.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=680.62s)]
*  I would also call out that, you know, a balanced approach to scaling an [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=682.18s)]
*  organization is also crucial. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=685.5799999999999s)]
*  You know, the key is ensuring that the company's value drivers like development [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=688.8199999999999s)]
*  programs are adequately funded to reach critical inflection points while [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=692.78s)]
*  simultaneously bringing in the necessary expertise to inform optimal decision [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=698.3399999999999s)]
*  making and resource deployment. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, I think before, you know, you build the whole house, you want to you [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=705.26s)]
*  want to make sure that the fundamental plumbing is is is working and ready to go. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=709.06s)]
*  And then you can certainly scale accordingly. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=715.3s)]
*  And I think. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=717.86s)]
*  You need to when I, when I talk about development programs, it's not just [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=720.5s)]
*  making sure that the programs are fundamental and that they're, and you're [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=723.4599999999999s)]
*  going to be delivering some good data. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=726.86s)]
*  But I think you also need to understand, you know, what are you going to need to [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=728.86s)]
*  do organizationally to grow that? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=732.3s)]
*  What are your inflection points? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=736.14s)]
*  What are your timing? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=737.9s)]
*  Because again, if you're looking to go public as well, you need to have all of [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=739.3s)]
*  these things identified because timing is is is really important. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=743.3399999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, it's also the tail wag and the dog. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  You know, you do need to understand how to build the organization. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=750.26s)]
*  And I think the organization follows follows really the development programs. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=753.6999999999999s)]
*  Also, you know, time is a critical factor. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=760.54s)]
*  Many factors influence these decisions, but one constant remains. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=763.9s)]
*  Time is the enemy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=768.0999999999999s)]
*  The time and costs associated with poor decision making can never be recaptured. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=769.74s)]
*  It's you know, time is lost and you never get that back. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=776.9s)]
*  So you do need to think about, you know, not being, you know, so focused on today's [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=782.58s)]
*  cost, if it's going to have a real impact on tomorrow and that's a balanced thought. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=788.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm also often advocate that you don't want to get too much in front of your [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=793.38s)]
*  skis, but you can never lose cost of time. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=797.26s)]
*  And I can't say enough about it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=800.26s)]
*  But ultimately, the real question is how can companies source the expertise that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=803.9s)]
*  they most needly need on a practical basis? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=809.5s)]
*  Because there's no dispute that adult supervision is required. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=814.02s)]
*  But the shorter answer is one size doesn't fit all. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=819.3000000000001s)]
*  From a resource perspective, it may not be practical or even prudent to fully [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=822.82s)]
*  build out a C level team. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=827.1s)]
*  Instead, companies might consider more thoughtful scaling approaches like [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=829.1800000000001s)]
*  utilizing C suite executives on a fractional basis while leveraging others to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=833.94s)]
*  build out functional functionality along with these along with processes. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=838.74s)]
*  You know, a good, a good example. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=843.86s)]
*  It would be, you know, do you need to bring the CFO in day one or can the CFO [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=846.22s)]
*  help with providing guidance, helping strategically, helping with the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=851.86s)]
*  deslection of a controller who can then actually come in and put in the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=857.8199999999999s)]
*  foundational, you know, purchase to pay processes and safeguard your cash and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  also make sure that the underlying accounting is in order and that you have [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=871.3399999999999s)]
*  audited financial statements, which are prerequisites for going public. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=874.3399999999999s)]
*  You know, um, that's just an example. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=878.0600000000001s)]
*  Uh, and, you know, and I guess the kind of distill that, you know, you know, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=881.6600000000001s)]
*  if a company can't afford the entire cow, the fractional approach allows them to [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=887.22s)]
*  buy the stake instead and providing access to really the expertise needed to [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=891.74s)]
*  avoid costly mistakes without over committing resources, uh, to manage the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=897.7s)]
*  company's growth and organizational needs responsibly. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=903.26s)]
*  I want to, you know, you know, let's jump into that a little bit. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=908.26s)]
*  You know, this discussion around fractional, uh, fractional leadership [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=911.1s)]
*  versus bringing people on full time right out of the gate. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=914.86s)]
*  I want to kind of balance this. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=918.3000000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, I wanted to ask you a question around conversations that I've [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=919.86s)]
*  had with biotech leaders who, you know, tell me when they're talking about [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=924.82s)]
*  hiring strategy and oftentimes this comes along with them mentioning a very [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=928.22s)]
*  specific person, like, you know, the, you know, I've got Alan Shaw on my team. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=933.06s)]
*  Alan Shaw, uh, joined my team because he was available. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=939.4599999999999s)]
*  He's a ringer. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=943.66s)]
*  So I went out there and I hired Alan Shaw. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=944.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, they tell me that they hire these, they, they, they hire these [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=947.5799999999999s)]
*  executives when they're available, not necessarily when they're necessitated. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=950.9799999999999s)]
*  So, uh, I'm going to ask you a number of questions about this, but, uh, and, and [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=955.8599999999999s)]
*  how that sort of aligns with this fractional, uh, hiring mentality. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=960.3s)]
*  Um, other, other biotech execs tell me like, Hey, you know, I, I really [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=964.38s)]
*  like to have my Alan Shaw on my team. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=968.18s)]
*  I'm going to have Alan Shaw on my team. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=971.42s)]
*  I don't really think I need Alan Shaw yet, but when I need Alan Shaw, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=973.42s)]
*  I'm going to go get Alan Shaw. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=976.3399999999999s)]
*  What's the right approach there in your mind? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=977.9s)]
*  Is it like, Hey, this person's available. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=979.9s)]
*  You know, maybe it's a chief regulatory officer, for instance. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=983.02s)]
*  You know, we all know that like there comes a pretty distinct point on the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=986.0999999999999s)]
*  clinical path where if you don't have a chief regulatory officer advising you [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=989.9s)]
*  and leading that function, you're probably going to be in big trouble. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=993.5s)]
*  But maybe it's two years before you need that chief regulatory officer, but [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=996.86s)]
*  the one you want is available. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1000.66s)]
*  Do you go get her or do you wait until you need her? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1002.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's, it's a, it's a, it's such a real life, uh, situation. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1007.6999999999999s)]
*  And it's one that I've been in conversations many times and really on [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1012.38s)]
*  both sides of the, uh, conversation. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1015.9399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, again, cash financial resources is at rate limiting factor in [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1019.26s)]
*  terms of, uh, when you bring people on, if something, if you're expecting data, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1026.06s)]
*  do you wait till after you get the data? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1030.6599999999999s)]
*  You know, what happens, you know, if we don't, if this doesn't work, we're [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1032.94s)]
*  actually going to have to start laying people off as opposed to bringing people on. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1035.74s)]
*  So, you know, there, there's tension throughout all this process. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1039.5s)]
*  You know, many times I've, I've seen conversations that, you know, we, we'd [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1042.6599999999999s)]
*  like, we should talk in six months or we should talk in a year. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1046.42s)]
*  Um, but I certainly respect it. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1049.78s)]
*  And then you also have to ask yourself when you bring somebody in and the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1053.1000000000001s)]
*  company isn't ready for that, are they going to be happy? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1057.3400000000001s)]
*  Is there enough there for them right now? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1060.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1062.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, if you're, you know, you know, bringing it's bringing, going into a [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1063.3000000000002s)]
*  company full time that just completed their series a, I don't think necessarily [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1068.46s)]
*  makes a lot of sense for the company. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1072.98s)]
*  And, you know, this is not enough to do. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1074.7s)]
*  Maybe if you expand somebody's role, you can, you can do it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1076.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1080.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm the chief operating officer, the CFO and chief HR and administrative office. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1080.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1086.5s)]
*  My role is expanded, but am I happy? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1089.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1091.7s)]
*  Um, so, you know, I think it makes sense depending on the circumstances [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1092.66s)]
*  and how far off you are, uh, cause it should be win-win for everybody. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1097.54s)]
*  You know, the idea of hiring top talent, uh, whenever available, regardless [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1103.82s)]
*  of the immediate need is similar to the strategy of successful sports teams [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1109.3799999999999s)]
*  that direct that draft, the best athlete available rather than [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1113.34s)]
*  spiss billing of specific position. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1116.34s)]
*  Well, but I would also say that while it sounds rather idealistic, uh, it's [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1118.86s)]
*  probably much easier said than done. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1124.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1127.06s)]
*  I would also, you know, carrying on, I, you know, I think when you think [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1127.38s)]
*  about the prioritization of needs, I believe that, you know, in applying [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1133.3000000000002s)]
*  the Maslow hierarchy of needs to drug develop for drug development, you [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1139.2600000000002s)]
*  know, it serves as a guide for determining when hiring top talent is truly necessary [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1143.98s)]
*  versus when it might be, be an unjustifiable luxury. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1149.8600000000001s)]
*  And again, you know, bringing in expertise doesn't necessarily mean hiring. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1153.94s)]
*  There are a lot of different ways to, you know, inform your activities, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1158.66s)]
*  to execute, to work around issues without necessarily bringing, uh, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1164.3000000000002s)]
*  hiring somebody full time, but, you know, going back to your point, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1173.8200000000002s)]
*  you know, if you're, if you're, when I, uh, uh, I'm not sure if I'm [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1177.5s)]
*  one I, uh, I've, I see, uh, and living with, you know, we're, we're talking [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1182.94s)]
*  about a company that's talking about going into the clinic, right? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1187.7s)]
*  They're saying, you know, the use of proceeds, we're going in and we're [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1190.74s)]
*  running phase two, but they don't have a chief medical officer on staff. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1193.38s)]
*  You know, in my mind, you know, that's probably something that needs to be spoken [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1197.34s)]
*  to, you know, and I think people certainly understand that you may not be able to [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1201.98s)]
*  afford one right now that's, but I think then speaking about what is that, you [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1205.7s)]
*  know, type that you're looking for, what are you looking for to augment the team? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1210.22s)]
*  So I think those things are important to be aware of as you execute. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1214.26s)]
*  And then ultimately, you know, we're in the business of drug development and [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1219.5s)]
*  without data generation, there's no de-risking and as the saying goes, in [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1223.8600000000001s)]
*  God we trust and in data we believe. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1228.46s)]
*  This underscores the importance of aligning leadership hires with the [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1231.5s)]
*  critical stages of development and data generation. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1235.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1239.38s)]
*  And that's a, you know, that's another thing that I've noodled on, on several [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1239.98s)]
*  different occasions and had conversations with, with biotech builders about is, is [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1244.5800000000002s)]
*  sort of that, you know, the critical stages of development, data generation, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1249.18s)]
*  aligning with your, your key leadership hires, you know, in your experience, is [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1253.22s)]
*  there sort of a general playbook in terms of the cadence at which, cadence in [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1261.2600000000002s)]
*  order, right? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1268.18s)]
*  Cadence in order of hires. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1269.5800000000002s)]
*  We kind of talked about cadence, you know, cadence is a, is a cash dependent thing. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1271.5s)]
*  But if, if, if I'm starting out as a biotech builder, I've never done this [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1276.38s)]
*  before, is there a general rule? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1282.46s)]
*  Like, well, the first thing I need is a chief scientific, scientific officer. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1286.5800000000002s)]
*  The next person I'm probably going to need is somebody to help me with my finances, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1291.98s)]
*  you know, maybe a CFO. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1295.78s)]
*  At some point after that, maybe a chief technology officer would be great. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1298.22s)]
*  Then a chief medical officer, you know, and then a chief regulatory officer. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1305.3s)]
*  Like is there an, and then, and then, and then, or is that highly dependent? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1309.22s)]
*  You know, I'm, I would say that there's probably, if you're in the business of [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1315.3400000000001s)]
*  drug development, you know, you probably need somebody to, to underpin the [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1319.7s)]
*  technology. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1325.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, from what I've seen, you know, either the company's founded by the [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1326.62s)]
*  technology, whether it's been in sauce, you know, there's a champion behind the [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1330.22s)]
*  technology, but, you know, they could be a business person or a scientific person. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1333.8999999999999s)]
*  So yes, I think it starts, begins with the technology and it should be coupled with [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1339.1s)]
*  a business person, which could be the CEO. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1345.4199999999998s)]
*  And if the CEO is a scientific person, you know, you might want to pair them with [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1348.58s)]
*  somebody with a business orientation. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1353.66s)]
*  But I think initially, you know, the most important thing is does the, does the [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1356.5400000000002s)]
*  dog hunt, you know, it is, does the technology work and what's the plausibility [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1360.22s)]
*  for that, what's the hypothesis and what needs to be done to support that [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1366.66s)]
*  hypothesis. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1371.5400000000002s)]
*  And so it really depends where you are in the, in the journey of the, of the drug [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1372.98s)]
*  candidate or, or, or if you're preclinical, where are you in terms of nominating a [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1379.06s)]
*  candidate? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1384.06s)]
*  So I think there's different aspects to it, but you're absolutely right. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1385.46s)]
*  You know, I think the foundational leadership evolves in stages, bring in the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1390.58s)]
*  credibility and expertise as needed. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1395.5s)]
*  And again, I think it speaks to why a fractional approach could make sense again, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1397.62s)]
*  depending on where you are in your, in your evolution. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1403.46s)]
*  I think, you know, again, it comes back to focus on the product development plan. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1406.78s)]
*  I can't emphasize enough the importance of nailing down a product development plan [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1412.8999999999999s)]
*  with meaningful milestones that guide the financing strategy and the leadership [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1417.4199999999998s)]
*  build out. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1422.22s)]
*  I would also call out the need to pay attention to medical affairs early on. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1423.3s)]
*  Successful companies really do pay attention to this early on, cultivating [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1428.22s)]
*  meaningful relationships with the investigators and the clinicians. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1432.1399999999999s)]
*  It's really important. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1436.98s)]
*  It helps on so many different levels. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1438.1399999999999s)]
*  It helps drive patient accrual also on a financing side. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1439.86s)]
*  You know, investors don't necessarily always want to talk to the SAB. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1444.1399999999999s)]
*  They want to talk to people that are viewed to be much more objective and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1447.86s)]
*  independent. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1451.1s)]
*  So, you know, the medical affairs side of the house, even if you don't have a chief [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1452.18s)]
*  medical officer, it's still something that you want to be paying attention to [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1456.5s)]
*  early on and moving on. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1460.62s)]
*  I think the timing of key ires is always a consideration. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1462.9s)]
*  I think, again, it follows the development plan. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1467.1000000000001s)]
*  But I, you know, from what I've observed and, you know, I've noticed that CFOs [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1470.02s)]
*  are typically the last C-suite hire that's often brought on board before an IPO, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1475.98s)]
*  kind of akin to Ringo Starr joining the Beatles before they went on tour. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1483.7s)]
*  But with that said, I think getting a controller on board earlier on, as I [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1488.62s)]
*  mentioned before, to establish the internal control policies and procedures is a good [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1492.54s)]
*  practice because, you know, I remember when I was many times over the course of my [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1497.5s)]
*  career that, you know, if the steam room isn't working, I had no business being on [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1504.5s)]
*  the Lido deck. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1509.9799999999998s)]
*  So, you know, you need to make sure that your back office is fine, that you can [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1510.9799999999998s)]
*  safeguard your assets, particularly your cash, that you've got controls over [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1515.58s)]
*  procurement and that, you know, particularly during the clinical trial, the CROs [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1519.4199999999998s)]
*  aren't so great at it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1523.74s)]
*  So you do want to be able to be upfront and negotiate contracts that, I mean, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1524.98s)]
*  they're always going to be favoring the CROs, but there are efforts that you can [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1532.1799999999998s)]
*  do to level set those. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1535.54s)]
*  And again, people aren't necessarily aware of the business side, you know, as [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1536.98s)]
*  the name of this podcast, you know, it's the business of bio, but it's the [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1540.78s)]
*  business of biotech and sometimes people get lost in the weeds. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1544.82s)]
*  You mentioned the chief financial officer is often brought on last in advance of an [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1548.5s)]
*  IPO, which seems like perhaps a strategic move. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1553.42s)]
*  But have you noticed over the course of your career, any trends around leadership, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1557.42s)]
*  executive leadership positions that are most commonly ignored or brought on too [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1563.46s)]
*  late, maybe not ignored, but brought on too late? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1571.42s)]
*  You know, is there a problem area, a trend, you know, a trend in terms of the [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1573.82s)]
*  problem area in executive leadership appointment in biotech or not? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1580.82s)]
*  You know, maybe people make mistakes all over the continuum. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1586.34s)]
*  You know, it's a fair question to ask. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1590.2199999999998s)]
*  You know, I would say, you know, it's really about getting the right answers and [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1594.58s)]
*  being informed in a timely manner. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1601.98s)]
*  And I think it really comes down to how you source that. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1604.22s)]
*  And I do think people are late on the draw. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1607.5s)]
*  I think on the regulatory side, I've seen people, you know, take that for granted [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1610.54s)]
*  and not necessarily cultivate the FDA as they should and interact with them like [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1617.22s)]
*  they should. So, you know, I think, you know, regulatory side, and again, it [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1622.26s)]
*  depends on the company, you know, I've seen companies make bad decisions on [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1626.66s)]
*  hiring the wrong chief medical officer thinking they needed a higher chief [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1630.54s)]
*  medical officer. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1634.3799999999999s)]
*  And rather than getting the right one, they just lowered the bar and got who [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1635.86s)]
*  they can get. And sometimes it's a factor of the company and you not get who you [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1640.5s)]
*  want. But so I could say, you know, definitely time like going back to time [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1644.82s)]
*  being the enemy. You know, there are decisions that sometimes are made too [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1651.86s)]
*  late. You know, a lot of companies will bring a CFO in late, but they don't have [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1656.18s)]
*  the benefit of having advice along the way and they make bad decisions along the [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1661.0600000000002s)]
*  way. So, you know, I think it's really depends. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1664.78s)]
*  But I think there's instances all over the spectrum where you either are bringing [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1669.3s)]
*  in people late and making bad decisions prior to that. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think, unfortunately, there's a situation where you just bring in the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1677.14s)]
*  wrong person. And then that's also really costly and can set an organization back. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1680.9s)]
*  And we're not even talking about culture and the other implications. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1686.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Bringing in the wrong person. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1690.5s)]
*  That's a that's a great segue to my next question, because I'm seeing like I'm [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1692.5400000000002s)]
*  seeing some conflict in some of the words that I hear Alan Shaw talk about. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1696.94s)]
*  So I want you to straighten me out here on these. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1700.5400000000002s)]
*  Right. Like on one hand, on one hand, there's the old, you know, Alan Shaw [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1702.42s)]
*  stand by that and God we trust that all others must bring data. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1707.62s)]
*  Love that. And then there's the old Alan Shaw saw that says investors bet on [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1713.54s)]
*  on jockeys, not horses. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1721.4199999999998s)]
*  So like in my mind, in my in my very simple Pennsylvania boy mind, right, there's [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1724.1399999999999s)]
*  there's there's friction there. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1728.5s)]
*  There's some conflict, I should say. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1729.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1731.7s)]
*  Around companies that maybe aren't data ready, you know, so they just have to [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1733.9s)]
*  trust in God because they're not data ready, but they feel need to spend money [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1740.06s)]
*  on leadership horsepower because investors bet on jockeys, not horses. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1744.5800000000002s)]
*  What walk me through that? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1751.02s)]
*  Like how do we resolve that conflict? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1752.14s)]
*  Now, you got me dead in center. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1755.82s)]
*  I don't mean to call you out, buddy. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1762.18s)]
*  I know you're my friend. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1763.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to call you out. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1765.54s)]
*  No, it's a balancing act. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1768.42s)]
*  It really is. I'm always looking for I'm always looking for black and white [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1770.46s)]
*  responses and I know everything's gray here. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1773.18s)]
*  I get that. I know. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1775.8600000000001s)]
*  And and sadly, I've learned while I worked abroad that people perceive that [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1777.1000000000001s)]
*  there's many flaved many different shades of gray as well. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1782.54s)]
*  You know, you know, you're you're you're absolutely right. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1788.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, track records are crucial, especially when investors aim to mitigate [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1791.4199999999998s)]
*  the inherent risks of the sector, such as such as industrial jeopardy [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1795.5s)]
*  and binary outcomes. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1800.6599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, betting on someone who's done it before, who has much less [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1803.3799999999999s)]
*  in way of blind spots, if any, who is much more secure and not making fearful [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1808.58s)]
*  decisions, but making decisions based on their experiences and facts and [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1814.22s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1818.46s)]
*  There's a lot to be said for that. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1820.02s)]
*  You know, it's really the question of how you do pace, right? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1822.78s)]
*  You know, I think, you know, the CEO, you want to set the tone at the top [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1826.26s)]
*  and a good CEO will attract the resources that needs and a good CEO will know [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1829.94s)]
*  the resources that are required in the most cost effective way to source them [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1836.26s)]
*  and will build an advisory group and get the input on things that need input on. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1841.46s)]
*  So you're there's no there's no getting around that. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1846.94s)]
*  But, you know, I think it's really the pace of how you build that out [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1849.98s)]
*  and how you source the rest of the organization. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1853.62s)]
*  But, you know, there's no question about it that past experience is a good [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1857.74s)]
*  predictor for future performance. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1861.6599999999999s)]
*  No question. And management is a great differentiator, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1864.46s)]
*  you know, given the numerous factors beyond the company's direct control, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1868.94s)]
*  capital markets, scientific developments, regulatory hurdles, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1873.34s)]
*  competition, reimbursement challenges. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1877.8600000000001s)]
*  The quality of a management team becomes the key differentiator in determining [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1880.98s)]
*  success, particularly in turbulent times. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1884.74s)]
*  So I stand by that [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1886.9s)]
*  in every which way. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1890.58s)]
*  My only point is is pace and, you know, a good management team [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1892.38s)]
*  can usually more times not generate the financial backing [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1898.46s)]
*  to execute and put a team. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1904.38s)]
*  And again, I think coming back to time, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1907.18s)]
*  you know, if you're properly capitalized and you've got a robust development plan, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1910.38s)]
*  then you need an organization around that. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1915.94s)]
*  But I still stand by the fact that it's development plan and your [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1918.06s)]
*  development activities that drive the pace of your organizational development. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1922.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, very good. All right. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1928.58s)]
*  You cleared that up for me. There's no more friction. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1930.5s)]
*  No more friction. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1933.34s)]
*  I'm glad that we're able to harmonize those concepts. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1934.4199999999998s)]
*  I want to I want to I want to jump back into [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1939.8999999999999s)]
*  into a conversation that you've dropped hints on multiple times already [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1943.58s)]
*  in this in this conversation around fractional leadership. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1947.78s)]
*  I want to dig in there a little bit. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1950.58s)]
*  And you've got plenty of experience in this realm. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1953.1s)]
*  I mean, you know, you were you you've done some fractional leadership. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1954.8999999999999s)]
*  As I mentioned in the in the intro, you've been a fractional leader [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1960.34s)]
*  and you've you've hired fractional leaders. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1964.3s)]
*  You've got a lot of a lot of experience on this. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1965.98s)]
*  So let's revisit that and maybe start with just [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1968.9399999999998s)]
*  summarizing or kind of tightening up when it makes sense [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1972.26s)]
*  to bring on a fractional leader versus going out there [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1975.9399999999998s)]
*  and spending big money on that ringer. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1979.58s)]
*  Not fair enough. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1983.6999999999998s)]
*  And again, I think, you know, if you want to use an analogy, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1984.6999999999998s)]
*  use the gas tank, you know, how much gas do you have in your tank? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1989.58s)]
*  And, you know, and that helps inform how fast you drive the car [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1993.46s)]
*  and whether or not you can get to your next destination. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=1999.22s)]
*  So, you know, I think figuring out how you do more with less, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2002.78s)]
*  I think really drives the concept of the fractional approach. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2007.5800000000002s)]
*  Obviously, idealistically, if you can afford it [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2011.7800000000002s)]
*  and everyone's going to be engaged and happy, you can have everybody day one. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2014.5800000000002s)]
*  But, you know, you're going to be [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2019.22s)]
*  spending money that could otherwise be redeployed [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2021.42s)]
*  on drug development and what I would otherwise characterize as [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2025.0200000000002s)]
*  value creating activities. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2029.18s)]
*  So, you know, you really have to with that in mind, understand that [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2032.5400000000002s)]
*  and tie that to the company's evolution. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2036.78s)]
*  You know, the decision to bring on a fractional leader versus hiring full time [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2039.14s)]
*  depends on where the company is in its development. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2043.66s)]
*  You know, preclinical, clinical, late clinical or planning an IPO. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2047.02s)]
*  I think those are important. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2051.9s)]
*  You know, as you evolve an organization, people, you know, taking it [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2055.02s)]
*  going back to the Wizard of Oz, people want to know if there's anybody else [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2059.66s)]
*  besides the man behind the curtain. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2063.3s)]
*  So, you know, you need a team, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2065.18s)]
*  you know, and this does allow you to kind of approach it from up, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2068.42s)]
*  bringing in the expertise that's necessary to inform good decisions, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2073.5s)]
*  you know, to inform what you need to do in your clinical plan [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2078.22s)]
*  in terms of filing your I.N.D., you know, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2081.66s)]
*  You know, and I think, you know, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2087.14s)]
*  you got to look at this kind of bill versus buy type of thing. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2090.18s)]
*  And, you know, I think there's tipping points for hiring as well. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2094.06s)]
*  You know, I think that the functional need begins to require more than [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2098.7400000000002s)]
*  50 percent of someone's time. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2102.3s)]
*  It's a good moment to reevaluate the role and understand that. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2104.94s)]
*  I mean, by doing so, it ensures that the leaders are proactive [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2109.82s)]
*  rather than reactive. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2114.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, if, you know, you want somebody, I think, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2115.82s)]
*  that has a view to what's in front as well as what's behind. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2119.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think if you're trying to limit people to time [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2124.46s)]
*  or if the organization's evolving, you know, at the point that they're at 50 [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2128.2200000000003s)]
*  percent and they need you need more, you need to start thinking about [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2132.34s)]
*  whether you need someone in there to get ahead of things and being proactive [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2135.6200000000003s)]
*  rather than reactive. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2139.42s)]
*  You know, I think it's [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2141.6200000000003s)]
*  and again, too many, too many sad stories [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2143.34s)]
*  where I've seen pitfalls of folks being penny wise, but pound foolish. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2146.18s)]
*  And you need to understand what the long game is. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2150.66s)]
*  But you also can't get in front of your skis too much. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2153.98s)]
*  Hopefully that's not another contradiction. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2156.34s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, I get it. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2160.42s)]
*  Just a quick follow up on that. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2164.38s)]
*  You know, you talk about. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2165.9s)]
*  You know, 50 percent. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2168.46s)]
*  Yeah, when a when a fractional employee gets to the point [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2170.22s)]
*  where the 50 percent of the work is dedicated to your company, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2172.78s)]
*  maybe it's time to start looking at bringing that person out full time. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2175.34s)]
*  If that's the right if that's the person you want. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2178.3s)]
*  Like, I'm curious about your perception on the fractional, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2181.1800000000003s)]
*  quote unquote, like market. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2185.1400000000003s)]
*  I just had a conversation a couple of days ago [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2187.06s)]
*  with a guy who had a fractional chief sign, no, chief technical officer. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2190.1000000000004s)]
*  And the guy was working on contract for his for his biotech. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2195.54s)]
*  And he wanted the guy like he wanted the guy on full time. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2199.38s)]
*  But the guy was happy being a contractor. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2202.78s)]
*  And only when that guy got to the point where to your point, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2205.14s)]
*  he was doing like 60 percent of his work on this one client [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2209.42s)]
*  that he even entertained coming on full time. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2212.8199999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, for the biotech builder I was talking to, he wanted that guy. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2215.7s)]
*  So we brought him on full time and now he's there full time and it's great. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2219.14s)]
*  But is there so this is the follow up. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2222.46s)]
*  I'll try to be more concise with my follow up. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2225.62s)]
*  Is there like a market of like, you know, CXO for hire that, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2227.94s)]
*  you know, the the biotech industry can take advantage of knowing full well [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2234.2999999999997s)]
*  that those people are fractional and disposable? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2238.94s)]
*  Or is it more a case where they have access to a CXO for hire [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2241.54s)]
*  that maybe they want to test drive, try on for size [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2246.94s)]
*  and perhaps bring on full time down the road? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2250.58s)]
*  You know, there is there is a market for this [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2254.42s)]
*  and it's becoming increasingly popular, certainly for CFOs. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2257.7s)]
*  It's the number of organizations that that that do that. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2262.38s)]
*  And it seems to be growing rather significantly, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2267.5s)]
*  which I think really underscores the demand and the acceptance [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2270.06s)]
*  as a way of conducting business. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2273.62s)]
*  I'm not aware, but I believe there are organizations [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2277.34s)]
*  that can provide CMOs under the same type of situation. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2280.78s)]
*  And then there's a lot of what I would say, people who freelance [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2286.42s)]
*  in that in that in that regard, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2290.86s)]
*  who don't need to necessarily need a broker. Right. You know, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2293.74s)]
*  why why why should I be sharing a part of what's being generated [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2298.14s)]
*  with a broker if you can generate it without a broker? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2301.58s)]
*  So so I think there's a there's a market for it. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2305.18s)]
*  And I think, you know, also, I think [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2308.14s)]
*  talking through colleagues, you know, for instance, I [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2311.38s)]
*  I connected to a situation from talking to somebody [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2315.34s)]
*  who is in a CEO leadership group and at the CEO leadership group, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2319.94s)]
*  someone expressed the need for a CFO, fractional CFO. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2323.58s)]
*  And that one thing led to another [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2327.9s)]
*  in another situation, you know, I know people that I've worked with in the past [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2331.02s)]
*  and they, you know, they approach you and they they say, you know, we [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2335.8199999999997s)]
*  we want you to join the team. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2339.38s)]
*  But we can't we can't, you know, this is where we are in our development. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2341.8199999999997s)]
*  And, you know, so it's only a more on a fractional basis. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2345.06s)]
*  But, you know, I think, you know, for the person that you referred to, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2348.82s)]
*  who really liked doing what they were doing, it there's a lot to be said. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2352.1s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of advantages on on a couple of levels. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2356.86s)]
*  I mean, on on on a company side perspective, right, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2361.82s)]
*  you are getting a test drive, you know, if you decide that you might [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2365.2200000000003s)]
*  want to try to hire this person in the future, you can see how they fit in. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2369.06s)]
*  And, you know, and you minimize the costs of a bad hiring decision. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2372.94s)]
*  For sure. On the flip side, from the from the purse, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2379.42s)]
*  the service providers perspective, you know, it gives them optionality. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2382.86s)]
*  Right. Because even the best in drug development only have, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2387.7000000000003s)]
*  you know, a success rate of what, 10 percent, 20 percent, maybe. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2392.1s)]
*  You know, you you know, you I think having a portfolio approach [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2397.78s)]
*  makes sense from a risk management perspective. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2402.34s)]
*  You know, what works good for for investors? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2404.94s)]
*  Can we work for the operator? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2407.82s)]
*  And I'm certainly quite fond of collecting lottery tickets [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2409.94s)]
*  as I as I go about my business and [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2413.78s)]
*  and you only need one win to to move the needle. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2417.18s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2420.06s)]
*  But what other advantages does fractional leadership create for for biotech companies? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2422.06s)]
*  You mentioned a number of my just want to make sure I'm not [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2427.94s)]
*  leaving anything on the table here. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2430.22s)]
*  No, absolutely. Happy to happy to. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2432.22s)]
*  Fractional leadership allows an organization to leverage [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2436.06s)]
*  subject matter experts with extensive experience without depleting resources. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2438.66s)]
*  This is particularly valuable where environments such as the one we're in now, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2443.66s)]
*  where the cost of capital is extremely high [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2448.26s)]
*  and ensures that the organization benefits from expertise [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2452.22s)]
*  without committing to full time costs. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2455.38s)]
*  And if you don't like it, you have the freedom to change to somebody else, too. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2459.18s)]
*  So, you know, there's there's you know, you minimize the downside, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2463.34s)]
*  but you are opening up the window to getting expertise that you might not otherwise have. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2466.5s)]
*  And I think it does reduce your blind spots at the end of the day [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2471.86s)]
*  and allows you to make more informed decisions. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2474.6200000000003s)]
*  And as you know, it's a constant theme. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2477.5s)]
*  Time is the enemy. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2479.82s)]
*  You don't get the time back. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2480.78s)]
*  You know, you make a bad decision. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2482.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, there's time and there's costs. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2484.3s)]
*  And, you know, and people, you know, people look at runway, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2486.82s)]
*  but they forget about overhead overheads that silent killer. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2490.46s)]
*  So, you know, again, you do want to minimize your overhead [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2494.66s)]
*  and fractional organizations do extend the cash runway. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2497.14s)]
*  I I'm assuming I mean, I don't even know what they are. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2504.54s)]
*  Like, I'm not going to make any guesses, but there's got to be, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2508.5s)]
*  you know, at least some risk levels around hiring contract employees, fractional employees. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2511.54s)]
*  So so what a biotech leaders who are considering it need to be cautious about, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2518.1400000000003s)]
*  you know, they say, OK, well, I think maybe for all these reasons [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2522.82s)]
*  that Alan Shaw has been expanding and expounding on on this episode of the business of biotech, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2526.6600000000003s)]
*  maybe it makes sense for us to to do some fractional leadership hiring. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2532.78s)]
*  What do I need to be careful about? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2536.98s)]
*  You know, you're bringing somebody into your team, right? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2539.7400000000002s)]
*  So, you know, you should certainly exercise similar care. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2542.54s)]
*  While they're easier to adjust to replace than a full time staff, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2548.02s)]
*  I think it's still crucial to to, you know, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2553.54s)]
*  ensure cultural compatibility, among other considerations. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2557.1s)]
*  You know, referrals are a valuable source to finding qualified people. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2561.34s)]
*  As I mentioned, many experienced professionals are adopting a portfolio [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2565.3s)]
*  to their careers in life sciences. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2569.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think as a consequence, you know, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2572.3s)]
*  there's a body of work that can be evaluated as well [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2576.46s)]
*  as as you talk to them. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2580.78s)]
*  So, you know, I think a little reference check is helpful. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2583.18s)]
*  I think looking at their body of work [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2586.98s)]
*  and, you know, I would be probably more focused on [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2591.1s)]
*  not necessarily the references that they may provide. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2594.38s)]
*  But I think, you know, given that it's such a small sandbox that we live in, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2598.02s)]
*  I think, you know, just identifying people [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2604.54s)]
*  who may have crossed paths with this person [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2607.5s)]
*  that's in your network is also a very valuable way of independently [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2610.8199999999997s)]
*  vetting a person, whether you're whether it's fractional, whether it's full time. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2615.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2619.7799999999997s)]
*  All right. I'm going to drill down a little further on that question around [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2621.62s)]
*  around risk, because it occurs to me, you know, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2625.14s)]
*  this is a highly sensitive industry that we work in. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2628.18s)]
*  And I've spent my entire career in the publishing industry. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2630.42s)]
*  And I've worked as a full time employee. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2634.62s)]
*  I've worked as a contract employee. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2637.06s)]
*  I've been, you know, an independent contractor. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2638.62s)]
*  And even in publishing, I've had to sign a lot of IP agreements, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2641.5s)]
*  non-compete agreements, you know, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2646.3s)]
*  in this biotech space, you know, IP is so fiercely protected and so important. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2649.7400000000002s)]
*  What what sort of precautions and protection should biotech employers be aware of [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2656.06s)]
*  or considering when they're saying, like, hey, I might bring Alan Shaw in as a fractional CFO, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2662.42s)]
*  not knowing necessarily whether Alan Shaw is also being a fractional CFO [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2668.7000000000003s)]
*  for for my biggest competitor, someone else is playing in the same indication [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2673.62s)]
*  I'm in with a very similar molecule. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2677.38s)]
*  Like, what do I need to do to protect myself? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2679.86s)]
*  You know, in the situation that you specifically called that, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2682.1s)]
*  you know, that probably would be the end of the discussion. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2685.38s)]
*  I'm not sure how you how you build a firewall or Chinese wall [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2691.54s)]
*  high enough to to insulate you against that. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2695.54s)]
*  But, you know, I think sometimes the best decision is decision not to do something. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2700.46s)]
*  But I but I think as a general rule, I think the protections or the safeguards [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2704.54s)]
*  or the safeguards taken for fractional leadership are really similar to those for full time hires. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2710.1s)]
*  You know, the standard agreement should include confidentiality clauses. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2716.6600000000003s)]
*  There should be indemnification, non-poaching of employees and clear terms [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2720.7400000000002s)]
*  for company ownership of any inventions or intellectual property [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2726.26s)]
*  developing during the engagement. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2729.6600000000003s)]
*  So, you know, you want to kind of preempt [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2733.6200000000003s)]
*  issues of dispute and really clarify it should be clarifying. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2735.58s)]
*  And so that's very definitive. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2740.02s)]
*  And these things are done for when you hire full time employees. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2741.58s)]
*  And I think similar practices should be undertaken as well. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2745.38s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Very good. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2750.58s)]
*  All right. We're we're getting short on time here. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2752.58s)]
*  So I'm going to wrap it up with another question or two, if that's cool with you. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2754.58s)]
*  We've talked a little. Yeah, we've talked a little bit about this. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2758.58s)]
*  Like the, you know, try before you buy and boy, I really like this person. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2762.38s)]
*  I'd like them to be full time. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2766.98s)]
*  But from a business perspective, you know, just just because I just because I think [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2769.58s)]
*  Alan Shaw would be a great CFO full time. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2772.98s)]
*  He's been doing good work for me fractionally. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2775.98s)]
*  It might not be a smart thing to do to go ahead and transition you into the CFO role [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2777.98s)]
*  from a full time from a fractional role. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2783.98s)]
*  So when does it make sense? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2786.58s)]
*  Like, what are the what's the writing on the wall that you're going to do? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2788.98s)]
*  What's the writing on the wall that says, you know what, it's time. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2790.98s)]
*  It's time to transition this guy into into my full time position. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2793.18s)]
*  You know, I would say the when is when the functional need begins to require more than 50 percent of someone's time. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2798.38s)]
*  And that's a really good time to reassess the role, understand where you are with your development, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2806.68s)]
*  understand where you are with your financing. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2811.98s)]
*  Can you afford it? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2813.98s)]
*  And I think it's also a good time to also just generally evaluate what other gaps do I have in my organization that need to be addressed. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2815.28s)]
*  And, you know, just as an organization evolves, I'd also call out that, you know, sometimes you you confront it with organizational obsolescence [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2825.28s)]
*  where the organization has grown quicker than the people and you want to get in front of that as well. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2834.48s)]
*  You know, it has implications on the culture, it has implications on execution. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2840.6800000000003s)]
*  And as a company is growing, you know, if you can recycle folks and put them in an area for success, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2844.58s)]
*  as opposed to them being an impediment as the organization evolves, you know, that's it can be a win win for everybody in respect to the why. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2849.98s)]
*  The why is transitioning at this stage helps leaders to be proactive rather than reactive, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2860.2799999999997s)]
*  avoiding the mistakes of trying to save money in the short term while potentially causing bigger problems in the long term. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2867.28s)]
*  You know, I think at the end of the day, you can either allow external factors to manage you [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2877.08s)]
*  or you can do a job better job of managing external factors to help derive the outcomes that you're working towards. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2884.48s)]
*  Yeah, what I feel like we've I feel like we've we've beat this horse pretty hard. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2895.38s)]
*  Like I think I think we've attacked this this discussion from multiple angles and relentlessly. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2904.38s)]
*  But I'm curious, what what what are we what am I missing? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2910.78s)]
*  What should I have asked? Is there anything I should have asked you that's like an important important part of this [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2914.1800000000003s)]
*  was hiring strategy and particularly the fractional part is super fascinating to me. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2919.2799999999997s)]
*  But is there a facet that we we didn't beat on hard enough or at all? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2926.18s)]
*  You know, I would say from a general perspective, I think we covered the concept and the approach to scaling an organization [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2932.08s)]
*  in a responsible, practical manner to achieve your your goals without compromising on time. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2942.28s)]
*  You know, I think it would be important to emphasize that, you know, these aren't races, but these are a marathon [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2949.28s)]
*  and that, you know, you need to kind of thoughtfully think about your development plan and think about how you go about [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2958.28s)]
*  filling the gaps. I think, you know, I think we go back to the beginning of this thing in terms of decision making. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2965.28s)]
*  And I think at the end of the day, people make good decisions with good information and to best way to minimize [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2971.28s)]
*  to mitigate the risks that the industry and the drug development pathway has. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2979.28s)]
*  I think it serves everyone well to make sure that you have the right thought leadership available to execute. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2984.28s)]
*  Yeah, very good. Well, this is it's always a blast. It's always fun talking with you. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2992.28s)]
*  It's always fun watching your face when I ask you the same question I just asked you in a different set of words, you know. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=2998.08s)]
*  You're always a good sport to keep coming back on here and subjecting subjecting yourselves to these interviews [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=3007.08s)]
*  and I always have a fun time doing it. So thank you. Lots of insight there. We appreciate it. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=3012.08s)]
*  Oh, always a pleasure to go back and forth with you harmonize my conflicts and contradictions [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=3019.08s)]
*  and now I look forward to doing it all again. Yeah, we need to do it again in person soon. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=3026.88s)]
*  It was it was JP Morgan the last time we did one of these face to face and that was it. That was a good time. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=3034.88s)]
*  I enjoyed that. So we'll make that happen. No, absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=3039.88s)]
*  Let's put our I think there's more than one way to approach that. But yeah, we'll take that offline. You betcha. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=3044.88s)]
*  So that's CFO extraordinaire Alan Shaw. I'm Matt Piller. This is the business of biotech. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYEddmvyFE&t=3052.68s)]
