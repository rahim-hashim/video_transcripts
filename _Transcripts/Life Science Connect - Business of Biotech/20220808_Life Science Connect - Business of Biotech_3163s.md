Video Description: Vaxxinity CEO Mei Mei Hu, J.D. leads a company with some lofty ambitions. The democratization of healthcare, interplanetary colonization, and development of accessible therapeutic vaccines to serve and enable both. Those big-picture visions have helped the company establish itself as a pioneer of the "third biologics revolution." On this week's Business of Biotech podcast, Mei Mei joins me to share Vaxxinity's strategy, what "democratization" and "revolution" really_mean, why traditional vaccines and biologic therapies are converging to form the "third biologic revolution," and a whole lot more.

# What's A Biologic Revolution? With Vaxxinity's Mei Mei Hu, J.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [August 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc)
*  Fall of 2020, I had an opportunity to listen in on an interview that a colleague of mine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=0.0s)]
*  conducted with Meimei Hu, then co-founder and co-CEO of a company called Covax, which [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=10.68s)]
*  had literally just formed up at the time in response to, as its name implies, the COVID-19 [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  pandemic. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=23.88s)]
*  Now, the Business of Biotech podcast was just getting its feet wet back then, but I was [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  super intrigued by the story of how and why Meimei jumped into action as a giant global [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=30.36s)]
*  health emergency was just beginning to unfold. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=36.72s)]
*  And I took a note to get around the show. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=39.64s)]
*  I'm not sure why it took us almost a year and a half, two years to do it, but here we [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=42.0s)]
*  are. So on today's show, we're going to get to know Meimei and learn about the work she's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  doing at Vaccinity and hopefully get some insight into what inspired her into serial [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=52.28s)]
*  biopharma entrepreneurship after earning a Penn undergrad, a Harvard JD, and earning a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=56.68s)]
*  few stripes at McKinsey. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=62.8s)]
*  Since then, Meimei has gone into full entrepreneur mode. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  She's a member of the executive executive committee of United Biomedical. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=68.68s)]
*  She oversaw the launch of one of the first endo body vaccines in the world. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=73.28s)]
*  And with Vaccinity's IPO on NASDAQ last year, I believe she's now spun out five new [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=78.36s)]
*  companies. Meimei, I am super pleased, as I said, to finally have you on the show. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=84.0s)]
*  It's great to be here. Excited for this conversation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=90.68s)]
*  Yeah, me too. So I want to. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=93.44s)]
*  Typically, when I when I do one of these things like we spend, I don't know, the first [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=97.32s)]
*  five, 10, 15 minutes kind of learning about the inspiration, the backstory, you know, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=101.32s)]
*  what brought me to this current place and time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=106.55999999999999s)]
*  But I want to do that a little bit later. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=110.6s)]
*  I want to shuffle things around a little bit here today because I'm I think the most [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=111.88s)]
*  intriguing thing that strikes me about Vaccinity right now, and that's where I want to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=116.36s)]
*  start in here and now are some of the words that the company uses to convey its mission [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=121.88s)]
*  and the work that it's doing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=128.88s)]
*  And I want to kind of have a philosophical discussion about those words with you, meimei, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=131.4s)]
*  if we can, because I see words like democratization and revolution. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=135.84s)]
*  Right. And straight from the top, I want to let's start with democratization. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  It's not the first time I've seen it, but somehow I don't know. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=146.32s)]
*  You guys must have a really crack marketing team because somehow the words and the text [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=149.8s)]
*  that I read about your approach to democratization on Vaccinity's website make me believe [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=155.32s)]
*  that it's more than just a public relations platitude or a piece of marketing hype. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=161.16s)]
*  It's a no democratization is something we see all the time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=168.52s)]
*  It's a noble. It's a formidable challenge. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=172.0s)]
*  What's my point? The words kind of in co-opted right to the point that it's abused. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=175.32s)]
*  So let's start there. What is what is the and I'm not asking you to justify the use of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  the word. Don't get me wrong. I just I want to start by understanding what democratization [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=185.6s)]
*  means the Vaccinity and why it is so central to the mission and the work going on there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=189.92s)]
*  So it's our North Star, right? It's not a marketing ploy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=195.92s)]
*  We talked about it before I started. I don't have a LinkedIn page, so we're not very good [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=199.28s)]
*  at marketing and hyping, but it's the essence of who we are in our business model. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=204.56s)]
*  Democratization. What does it mean? It means taking something that is otherwise only available to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=211.2s)]
*  a select few and making it available to everyone, right? It's the democratization of vote, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=219.2s)]
*  the democratization of books through the printing press, the democratization of cars through [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=224.16s)]
*  Ford's Model T. What we're trying to do is democratize and make one of the most successful [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=229.76s)]
*  class of drugs by logics that are currently only available to about 1% of the world's population [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=236.56s)]
*  and make it accessible, affordable, convenient, effectively available to everyone. That's the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=243.36s)]
*  essence. And why can we do it or why do we believe we can do it? It's all based on technology. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=250.56s)]
*  So I think the core for innovative and exponential technology is the ability to democratize whatever [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=257.44s)]
*  it is that it's working on. And we're just fortunate that we have a technology platform [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=265.12s)]
*  that we believe can do that. Yeah. You say it's your North Star, and I want to talk a little bit [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=270.0s)]
*  about sort of like at Form Up, and maybe this will get into the back story. I warned you, Mei-Mei, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=276.32s)]
*  that I'm a nonlinear thinker and we probably bounce around a lot. So I'm going to let you kind [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=281.68s)]
*  of direct where to start with the response to this question. But when a company forms up, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=285.68s)]
*  and I know that vaccine is sort of the product of some evolutionary activity, right, from years ago. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=290.48s)]
*  So maybe you can kind of form that up for us. But when a company starts up, typically, in BioFarm [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=297.68s)]
*  anyway, a lot of times it's a market opportunity around an indication, or perhaps it's a new piece [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=304.16s)]
*  of science, something coming out of academia or a platform that can be adopted and leveraged to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=311.36s)]
*  develop a pipeline. But the concept, I don't think it's common for a startup to have central to its [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=319.6s)]
*  mission sort of this concept of like, you know, maybe we don't even know what we're going to build [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=326.8s)]
*  yet, but we want to go out there and build something that's accessible. So tell me about that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=331.12s)]
*  Like how did that North Star kind of come into play at Vaccinity? When did it become sort of, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=337.92s)]
*  well, the North Star? Yeah. So it's interesting, actually. I'm just sitting here thinking about it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=344.64s)]
*  The evolution of Vaccinity wasn't like a eureka moment, and similar to the North Star of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  democratization of health. These are things that, for better or for worse, have been, you know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=359.04s)]
*  evolving over years. So the technology, right, let's start with that, because that's the basis [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=366.16s)]
*  of any new biotech company. The technology was originally, you know, it started over two decades [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=372.8s)]
*  ago. Came out of Rockefeller University, initially supported by NIH grants, and its first applications [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  was in animal health. Okay, so, you know, the first company, United Biomedical, who touched this, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=384.8s)]
*  was asked in different pandemic to see if they could develop a vaccine for, you know, foot and mouth [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  disease, for livestock. After it became successful, you know, Lou and I became involved and said, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=398.0s)]
*  wonder if this can work for humans, and how do we prove it out in humans? And through the data, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=404.4s)]
*  we saw that there was an opportunity to democratize biologics, right, to be able to bring the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=412.64s)]
*  efficiency of vaccines to chronic disease, which is unique for a vaccine proposition. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=418.23999999999995s)]
*  And I think it's as you explore and unpack things that you begin to find your North Star. Sometimes [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=423.12s)]
*  it's cloudy out there, and it's only when the clouds separate that you can find where it is. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  And so it was only a few years ago that we said, you know, this technology has a unique application, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=433.12s)]
*  and that's where kind of the vision of being able to democratize health came up out. And the same [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=438.56s)]
*  thing with vaccine. You know, it wasn't just one day we woke up and said, hey, let's start vaccine. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=445.67999999999995s)]
*  It was a big evolution, first from a predecessor company called United Neuroscience, which is the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=451.91999999999996s)]
*  vehicle that we basically explore this platform in chronic diseases for the first time. And we [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=458.8s)]
*  started out with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, very challenging disease areas, but places where we [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=464.24s)]
*  saw massive unmet need and where the vaccine approach was more accepted at the time. And then [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=469.68s)]
*  we started COVAX, like you mentioned, in response to the global pandemic. And when we, you know, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=476.32s)]
*  realized that COVID wasn't going to leave, it was going to be around with us for a while. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=483.84s)]
*  You know, that's when we merged the companies into what is now Vaccinity. So, you know, again, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not great at packaging things, but that's how things evolve, right? It's about figuring it out [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  at the moment. And somehow they come, you know, they coalesce and merge and swerve into where we [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=498.96s)]
*  are today. Yeah. I should just note for our listeners benefit, when you mentioned Lou, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=505.35999999999996s)]
*  you're speaking of Lou Reese, your co-founder and husband. Can I ask you a personal question [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=512.88s)]
*  about you? At what point did you and Lou become partners, husband and wife? Which came first? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=519.6s)]
*  Kind of how did that relationship come together? Well, we met originally at Penn. So we've been [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=526.8s)]
*  together for over 20 years. And I think Lou and I are both, you know, we get our hands in a lot [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=532.16s)]
*  of things. And so we're always, you know, for the first time when we met, we always wanted to do [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=539.84s)]
*  stuff together. And so I think we've been working in one capacity or another together since right [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=546.0s)]
*  after college. So he is my partner in crime. And we've kind of founded and started everything, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=551.84s)]
*  including Vaccinity together. Is Lou a scientist? Neither of us are scientists, Matt. Yeah, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=560.96s)]
*  he's a, you know, business school background and I'm a recovering lawyer. So yeah. Yeah. All right. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  So I want to get back into the technology. But first, since we're there, you're, as I mentioned, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=578.32s)]
*  Harvard JD, Lou's not a scientist. You went to, was McKinsey right after you earned your JD? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=584.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So that was my first job out of law school. And what was the, when you went into McKinsey, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=592.08s)]
*  did you go right into the life sciences practice there? No, I thought about it, but I could actually [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=597.6s)]
*  get myself in there. So I ended up working on electric vehicles and, you know, other industrials. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=603.6s)]
*  So probably the exact opposite. But yeah. At what point, you said you probably would have gone there, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=612.16s)]
*  but couldn't get yourself in there. And then at what point, I guess, on the continuum, you know, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=619.76s)]
*  Harvard JD, McKinsey doing some consulting analyst work, electric vehicles. At what point did you go, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=624.96s)]
*  life sciences is where it's at? Well, I'm not sure it was an active decision, but it turned into a [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=632.72s)]
*  life passion. So I just will evaluate that story. So, you know, while I was at McKinsey, Lou's [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=640.48s)]
*  father passed away suddenly on the river, actually here in Montana. And, you know, we ended up, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=649.12s)]
*  I ended up taking a leave and helping him sort some stuff out. And from there, things, you know, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=656.32s)]
*  manifested, and I ended up getting myself on the investing side. And then an opportunity came up [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=662.24s)]
*  with United Biomedical, where they needed help with, frankly, you know, legal issue. And Lou and I [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=668.48s)]
*  just decided, you know, let's try and lend our services and help and restructure this. That [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=678.64s)]
*  led to us discovering the technology. And fast forward over 10 years now, and that's where [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=686.4s)]
*  vaccine was born out of. Yeah. That's an interesting story. You know, I always ask these [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=693.12s)]
*  questions as though the assumption is there was some, to your point earlier, I think you used the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=698.72s)]
*  word aha moment, right? Like, there's never an aha moment. I don't know why I set those questions [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=703.04s)]
*  up that way. Well, we like to package things like that, right? And there are sometimes aha moments, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=708.0s)]
*  but they're smaller, generally speaking, or they evolve over time. So it's not like a second in time. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=716.96s)]
*  And, you know, I think this, if you look back, it's always interesting how we get to where we are, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=723.28s)]
*  but this was definitely an evolution over many, many years. Yeah. I want to get back to this [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=731.76s)]
*  conversation around what, I guess, set of tools and philosophies, if you will, management style, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=740.4s)]
*  whatever it might be, sets Vaccinity up for success in the endeavor to democratize [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=748.4s)]
*  access to biologics. And to the degree that you're willing to share, you know, what those tools look [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=756.72s)]
*  like and what that sort of approach looks like, obviously, you're not going to share the secret [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=764.4s)]
*  sauce with me if there is secret sauce to be shared, because we'll get in trouble with our PR [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=768.88s)]
*  handlers. But any specifics you can offer around, you know, what, as I said, I've had lots of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=773.36s)]
*  conversations with companies who, you know, I'll give you an example. Not too long ago, I had the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=778.56s)]
*  CEO of a company on who is developing, I guess, antibodies from, I believe it was antibodies from [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=782.32s)]
*  spirulina, right? Like from algae. And that approach is like, well, hey, there's one avenue [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=792.24s)]
*  to democratizing access to biologics by creating biologic therapies from something that is readily [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=798.32s)]
*  available, easy to grow. Obviously, there's a bunch of steps in between that could cost money, that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=804.1600000000001s)]
*  could, you know, create science, we could encounter scientific barriers to making it happen. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=809.84s)]
*  But the concept is super simple. Like, if we can create a medicine from something that anyone can [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=815.0400000000001s)]
*  effectively grow in a bioreactor, that's a great big giant step towards democratization. So, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=821.2s)]
*  in your case, I guess, what would be some parallels to that sort of like, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=828.96s)]
*  theoretic, like, this is how we're going to be able to crack this nut that's been so difficult [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=834.1600000000001s)]
*  to crack. It's so expensive. It's so difficult to move it around the world. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=839.12s)]
*  So, conceptually, it's super easy, right? Biologics are difficult right now, because [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=844.16s)]
*  they're difficult to make. They require these massive bioreactors and capex. They're difficult [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=850.4s)]
*  to take because, you know, you're passively infusing grams of antibodies often. And they're [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=855.28s)]
*  expensive because of that. So what we do is, you know, the vaccine approach just turns your body, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=861.76s)]
*  everyone's body into its own little bioreactor. So you become the drug factory. So we democratize, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=868.08s)]
*  just like Uber in some ways democratize the private driver by making everyone able to be a [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=873.6s)]
*  private driver. You know, vaccine, the technology makes everyone into its own little biologics [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=878.64s)]
*  factory. You know, conceptually, it's very simple and elegant. I would say that it's not trivial [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=884.88s)]
*  to do it successfully and safely. So the trick really, you know, we're not the first ones to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=892.0s)]
*  pursue this. But we're the first ones to see, at least I believe, it be able to be done in humans [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=897.12s)]
*  safely and consistently. So the body is super smart. The immune system is so much more advanced [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=904.88s)]
*  than any machine that we've built or that we even understand today. And it has a unique capability [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=911.04s)]
*  to protect itself, right? So human evolution says that we shouldn't attack ourselves. And as a result, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=917.92s)]
*  we don't like to create antibodies against self proteins. The problem is that as we get older, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=925.04s)]
*  and as we've used medicine to extend our lifespan, you know, into 70s, 80s, 90s, even longer, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=931.28s)]
*  you know, certain biologic processes break down. And it's actually the things that our bodies build [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=938.56s)]
*  ourselves that end up killing us, hence chronic diseases. So the challenge with vaccines is, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=945.68s)]
*  can you get your body to overcome immune tolerance and produce antibody drugs against [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=952.16s)]
*  yourself? And that's what we've been able to show. So hopefully that's what you think about [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=957.8399999999999s)]
*  conceptually about why we can democratize health. And then the premise behind it is, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, a little more complicated. Well, yeah, so maybe this is where that [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=970.7199999999999s)]
*  complication lies. My next question, as you were talking about this vaccine approach, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  you know, again, I've only been in the space for a couple of few years now, not a scientist, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=981.76s)]
*  don't have a biologics manufacturing background, but from what I've read and learned over the last [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=987.4399999999999s)]
*  couple of years, vaccine, the vaccine space, which, you know, kind of like when I started [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=992.88s)]
*  pre pandemic, I actually had a con I commented to a sort of an old timer colleague of mine, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=999.76s)]
*  the first six months of my job, I didn't talk to anyone about vaccines. It was before [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1006.88s)]
*  COVID reared its head. And all of a sudden, you know, vaccines were it, everyone was talking [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1011.92s)]
*  about vaccines. And I asked him, you know, you've been around for a long time, like, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1017.6s)]
*  was there ever a time when vaccines were sexy, you know, for business proposition? And the response [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1021.92s)]
*  was, and this is going to lead, you know, this is going to lead to my question. The response was, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1028.48s)]
*  no, not really, you know, not maybe since, I don't know, Gardasil made a splash back in the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1032.72s)]
*  day, whatever, like, but the response was basically like, vaccines are long development [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1038.4s)]
*  cycles. They're arduous, they're high, you know, everything's highly regulated, but the regulatory [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1046.16s)]
*  process to take a vaccine to approval was a long and arduous road. It was expensive, right? Like, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1051.2s)]
*  it was, it wasn't a darling, vaccines were not a darling in the investment community because [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1059.0400000000002s)]
*  sort of a, you know, long tail bet, you know, there was going to be a quick return on it, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1064.8s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. You know, you get the point. Well, then all of a sudden, you know, we're faced [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1069.84s)]
*  by, faced with a global pandemic. Vaccines are the response, the answer, and they become cool again. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1073.28s)]
*  All that is to say, this concept to, you know, to address chronic diseases with vaccine technology, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1081.36s)]
*  do any of those things that I just mentioned about why vaccines were not, you know, popular [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1089.3600000000001s)]
*  or perhaps well funded or, you know, discussed much for a long period of time, create challenges [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1096.24s)]
*  to the mission at Vaccinity? Sure. I mean, I'd be silly not to say yes, because there are [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1103.92s)]
*  challenges to, you know, any drug development. So I guess two things. First is the way we conceptualize [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1115.2s)]
*  vaccine is different than the traditional concept, right? Today, there are no vaccines against chronic [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1123.9199999999998s)]
*  diseases license. So everything that we know about vaccines, which we consider the first biologic [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1130.24s)]
*  revolution, they revolutionized medicine for infectious diseases. So these are all external [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1136.3999999999999s)]
*  pathogens, right? Like COVID. And when you're preventing something like that, there's thousands, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1143.44s)]
*  tens of thousands of patients, and you have to run these studies for a long time, or at least long [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1150.24s)]
*  enough that you can see, you know, a difference between the different placebo and drug arms. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1156.32s)]
*  You know, most of the applications that we think of in terms of Vaccinity are different. They're in [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1162.48s)]
*  a therapeutic context for biologics, right for chronic diseases. So a regulatory pathway is [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1168.16s)]
*  actually very similar to a traditional biologic or map. You know, CGRP and PCSK9, these are things [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1176.0800000000002s)]
*  for migraine and hypercholesterolemia. They're very well defined endpoints. Like, we just go [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1183.92s)]
*  in with the same development plan, very similar as our monoclonal competitor. So from that sense, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1189.76s)]
*  it's different. The only one that I would say is challenging, it's not because it's a vaccine, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1195.92s)]
*  but it's because of the disease state, and that's neurodegeneration. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1200.8799999999999s)]
*  challenging diseases, as we've seen, and more and more research is going towards, you know, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1206.0s)]
*  you got to prevent it before symptoms even begin. So when you're thinking of a decade long plus [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1211.6s)]
*  disease and preventing it, those are challenging, you know, what you would call long tails. So again, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1217.44s)]
*  I don't think it's because it's a vaccine, as much as the fact that the disease is difficult. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1224.96s)]
*  And in fact, vaccines may be the most and best way to attack them, period. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1230.56s)]
*  When you're striving to excel in a new arena, the best guides are the ones already doing it well. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1239.52s)]
*  The business of biotech brings those voices forward to help new and emerging biopharmers turn [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  their innovations like mRNA and cell and gene therapies into clinical realities. Tune in and [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1249.92s)]
*  subscribe for insights on hiring, regulatory and other need to know topics for biopharma leaders. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1256.48s)]
*  The podcast is brought to you in collaboration with Cytiva. Check out their resources at [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1262.5600000000002s)]
*  Cytiva.com backslash emerging biotech. That's C-Y-T-I-V-A.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1267.84s)]
*  That's a thank you for that clarification. And also it brings to mind another question, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1277.76s)]
*  maybe we can talk about this when we talk a little bit more about some of the candidates and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1282.6399999999999s)]
*  indications. But, you know, I talk about sort of the influence of sort of the historical perspective [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1285.84s)]
*  on vaccine development. You did a great job clarifying for me why this is different. Then [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1292.24s)]
*  you bring up Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. And I'm wondering, you know, given the past, I don't know, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1296.88s)]
*  12 months, 12 months, I think within 12 months, the news cycle around at you home. And, you know, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1301.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, all we keep doing as a community is re-proving just how difficult Alzheimer's in [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  particular is, right? In terms of the approvals that we're seeing around that indication. So [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1316.16s)]
*  is that an uphill battle? I'm just sort of, you gave me a quick response. Like the market, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1325.04s)]
*  I guess the go to market approach on an Alzheimer's drug, do stories like that create an uphill battle? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1329.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, sure. I would be lying if I said that that whole at your home launch didn't, you know, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1336.8s)]
*  bring everyone on a roller coaster ride. But, you know, at the end of the day, if you think about, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1344.08s)]
*  if that product was launched, let's just say a similar product was launched, but, you know, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1349.52s)]
*  you didn't have the safety side effects and you had a price that wouldn't, you know, bankrupt [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1353.6s)]
*  the healthcare system. I bet you that the reception and the enthusiasm would be very different. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1359.1999999999998s)]
*  But it's challenging. I mean, I'm not going to beat around the bush Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1365.84s)]
*  they're diseases of the brain. And most of the drugs that we have for the brain, we don't even [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1370.08s)]
*  know what the mechanism of action is. Thankfully for both of those, there is genetic links, right? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1373.6799999999998s)]
*  Genetics don't lie. We just have to figure out how to develop clinical development plans around [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1379.2s)]
*  that. So I think the targets, you know, I'm still a big amyloid fan, because I think that genetics [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1386.0s)]
*  ultimately, you know, speak the truth. And we're just trying to figure out how to show it, right, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1393.3600000000001s)]
*  in a classic research trial. But ultimately, you know, when you get on there, because the disease [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1402.4s)]
*  is so big, that's actually where democratization matters more. I wake up a lot and I look at [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1408.64s)]
*  colleagues and Alzheimer's and like, there are a lot of people working on it, right? But no one is [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1414.8000000000002s)]
*  working on treatment that is with the intention of being able to distribute and make it accessible [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1419.5200000000002s)]
*  to everyone that needs it. So that's what we're unique. I think we're also unique because [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1425.2800000000002s)]
*  we're probably one of the only ones that can prevent neurodegenerative diseases globally, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  which is important, right? Not only preventing, but being able to make it accessible globally, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1434.88s)]
*  because it's not just a US disease. These things don't discriminate. So I went off on a tangent, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1440.0800000000002s)]
*  but you gave me permission too early. Well, I warned you that I would, and I welcomed you to [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1447.3600000000001s)]
*  do the same. So welcome to the Tangential Thinking podcast. So this gives me, I guess, a couple of [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1453.44s)]
*  segue options. We can either start talking a little bit about the candidates themselves. You [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1462.72s)]
*  know what? Let's not do that. I want to stick with the original intent to learn about the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1468.88s)]
*  philosophical approach. And the next word that I want to pick on a little bit, not pick on, but [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1473.84s)]
*  just kind of throw out there and gain some understanding around vaccinities use of is [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1478.4s)]
*  the word revolution. So the third biologics revolution is kind of central to the mantra [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1484.3999999999999s)]
*  there. I see it time and time again in your copy. Tell us about that. First of all, very simple [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1492.6399999999999s)]
*  is this acknowledgement that vaccines were the first biologic revolution. I think antibodies [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1503.04s)]
*  were the monoclonal antibodies were the second and that vaccines for chronic disease is the third. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1510.72s)]
*  Is this a vaccinity thing or is this maybe something that's embraced by the broader community? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1519.28s)]
*  I think it's both. I think it's hard to challenge the idea that vaccines weren't a revolution. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1525.92s)]
*  They are now some vaccine preventable diseases. Over 80% of the world is vaccinated. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1533.44s)]
*  And I would posit that because of the success of vaccines, it's contributed to our doubling of our [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1543.52s)]
*  health span, our life expectancy over the last century, just over a century. So it's made profound [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1550.16s)]
*  impact on human society. Now, because of that success, chronic diseases now kill us more than [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1557.76s)]
*  everything else combined. So like famine, war, bacteria, just like external foes. Now our body [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1565.12s)]
*  itself is killing our chronic diseases is the leading killer everywhere in the world, by the way. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1574.8s)]
*  And so that's where the second biologic revolution comes in monoclonals. I mean, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1581.04s)]
*  they're like the magic drug, right? If you can get them, they're great. And I think they're [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1585.28s)]
*  revolution of itself. They're seven of the top 10 selling drugs, you know, ex-COVID. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1592.6399999999999s)]
*  And it's meaningful. I think it was a real miracle to be able to produce them artificially [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1598.6399999999999s)]
*  in bioreactors. It's a very complicated process that we figured out how to do. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  The challenge though, as I mentioned before, is that they're difficult. They're difficult to take, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1611.5200000000002s)]
*  difficult to make. They're extremely expensive. I think the average cost of a new biologic is [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1616.0s)]
*  about a hundred thousand dollars a year. So as a result, you know, less than 2% in the U.S. and [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1620.64s)]
*  1% worldwide are currently on them. So, you know, when we think about the third biologic revolution, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1627.44s)]
*  it's just combining the two. So bringing the efficiency of vaccines, which are convenient, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1632.88s)]
*  they're affordable. Like I said, 80% of the world has been vaccinated. So they reach every end of [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1638.48s)]
*  the earth, okay? Even places where they don't have electricity, right? Or running water, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1644.72s)]
*  people are vaccinated. But, you know, taking those and applying them to chronic diseases, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1651.12s)]
*  I think that's going to be one of the biggest changes in our health expectancy. And the idea [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1657.12s)]
*  also of moving towards prevention of chronic diseases, of maintaining our health despite [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1665.76s)]
*  our body, you know, breaking down. That's the next frontier. So that's what we mean. That's what I [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1673.76s)]
*  mean when I say the third biologic revolution. Yeah. So following question to a point you just [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1680.8s)]
*  made about distribution and access, and this is more of a sort of technical question, but what is [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1686.96s)]
*  your approach in terms of supply chain and distribution with the technology that you're [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1693.84s)]
*  working on? You know, I think, and again, you know, we need to differentiate between traditional [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1699.6s)]
*  vaccines. Right now, everybody's thinking about the COVID vaccine and cold chain storage and the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1704.6399999999999s)]
*  challenges there. And what's your answer to, you know, the vaccine approach for chronic diseases [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1710.7199999999998s)]
*  and chronic conditions and their prevalence globally and your approach to getting, I guess, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1718.24s)]
*  those therapies distributed? Yeah. So we're a vaccine, which means that we're small doses. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1724.32s)]
*  They last long, so you don't have to take them all the time. And, you know, unlike the mRNA stuff, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1732.24s)]
*  we're at normal cold chain storage. So it's a fortunate thing based on the technology. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1738.08s)]
*  You know, it's enabled by the technology. But, you know, my goal is to get to every corner, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1744.24s)]
*  just like a traditional vaccine would be able to get to. Pretty much anywhere you can get a cold [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1749.6799999999998s)]
*  diet Coke or fresh flowers, we can deliver our vaccines. Okay. That's a good way to put it. Yeah, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1755.4399999999998s)]
*  put things in context. So back to the revolutionary, you know, third biologic revolution [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1760.8s)]
*  discussion. One of the other things that strikes me about vaccine entities, I guess, embrace of [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1769.36s)]
*  the revolution concept is just how, I guess, tightly it seems to be woven into the corporate [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1778.24s)]
*  culture there. And the companies, I mean, you know, you've grown as this company has evolved [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1786.7199999999998s)]
*  and branched out, it's grown considerably. How much, what's your head count now? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1792.6399999999999s)]
*  We're about 100. Yeah, we're small, but I like it. It's right sized. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1796.88s)]
*  Right. Yep. And you've got a, you know, so 100, you've got a pretty stout, you know, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1802.16s)]
*  C-suite, some good folks on the management team there. But I guess the point I'm making is the [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1807.28s)]
*  perception is as though this, you know, democratization, revolution, culture is really, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1812.88s)]
*  it's really tight there. It seems to be on point with, you know, starting with you and Lou [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1821.76s)]
*  and right on down through the line. That's not an easy thing to maintain. I mean, you know, I'm 47. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1827.28s)]
*  I've worked for a lot of different companies and I've seen, like I've worked for this one for a [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1833.44s)]
*  long time and I've seen the culture roller coaster, you know, like we're at a really great place right [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1837.04s)]
*  now in this company. Like our culture is terrific, but there was a time when I can't say the same. So [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1842.0s)]
*  maintenance of any company culture is a difficult thing. And when you're as bold as [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1846.8s)]
*  Vaccinity is to say, we're going to go out there and really change the biologics paradigm. We're [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1852.6399999999999s)]
*  going to do something revolutionary. It's got to be difficult. So I'm using a lot of words right [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1857.2s)]
*  now, but you get my point. What's the secret sauce for you and Lou to maintaining momentum there? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1860.1599999999999s)]
*  I think, I don't think there's a secret sauce. It's just, you know, we have a very [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  attractive and inspiring mission that we believe in. And we attract people that believe in it also. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1871.92s)]
*  I mean, this isn't just a job, right? We don't want you to come here for a paycheck. You can [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1881.1200000000001s)]
*  get those lots of places. You know, you want to have to believe that you're part of something [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1885.6000000000001s)]
*  bigger. I think when people find their greater purpose, it stops, you know, it's still a job, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1890.3200000000002s)]
*  but it becomes more than a job, right? For me, it's life's passion now. It's grander purpose. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1897.4399999999998s)]
*  And there's something really fulfilling about that. But it's hard. I think relationships are [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1905.6s)]
*  the hardest part of life, right? And they require a tremendous amount of maintenance. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1913.52s)]
*  And so, you know, we're out there talking about it all the time. And I think it's important. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1918.96s)]
*  So, you know, I think it's the most important thing, people, frankly, and selecting the right [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1930.64s)]
*  people and building your tribe is important. And so, you know, we're still like a founder led [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1936.16s)]
*  culture. We're still like a startup culture. I was telling you before, we're out here in Montana, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1942.72s)]
*  and we hold our retreats here. And we get everyone off the grid, living in teepees and [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1947.84s)]
*  air streams and bonding and, you know, speaking at late night fires and stuff. And that's the [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1952.72s)]
*  culture, right? We want to be, we are different, and we're not afraid to be different. In fact, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1960.72s)]
*  we say that you have to embrace it. So embrace the differences, embrace your eccentricities, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1966.8799999999999s)]
*  and enjoy them. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1972.32s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah, which is awesome and appreciated and understood. At the same time, when you create [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1976.0s)]
*  such a unique culture, perhaps you open yourself up to the likelihood of not so great fit, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1982.8s)]
*  maybe more frequently, right? So because of the expectation, so, you know, you have this amazing, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1991.76s)]
*  amazing culture and amazing, you know, approach to maintaining it. You also have a very, very bold [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=1996.96s)]
*  mission and I can only imagine a ton of expectation on the people that you are employing to execute [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2003.6000000000001s)]
*  on that mission. Like it's not an easy task. You may, may strike me as someone who I would, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2011.68s)]
*  I guess I'd classify you as someone, again, I don't know you super well, but you would be [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2019.04s)]
*  incredibly exciting and incredibly challenging to work for. Like you would challenge me. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2023.92s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  Right, like, but because the mission is so bold. So I guess, how do you, does it become challenging [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2032.3200000000002s)]
*  sort of for you as the CEO to find the right people, maintain the right people, and maybe even [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2038.88s)]
*  like let the wrong people know, you know, when they're the wrong people? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2046.0800000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. All of the above. So I'm probably, you know, I consider myself like a servant leader. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2050.0s)]
*  My biggest calling is being able to help others do their job as best as they can. And same thing I [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2058.08s)]
*  tell my kids is like, so long as you're doing your best and you act with integrity, you can never be [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2065.28s)]
*  disappointed in yourself. That's all you can give, right? So that's all one can ask for. Again, we [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2069.44s)]
*  have the fortune of having this North Star. And so if you ever, you know, feeling like what can I do, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2075.68s)]
*  look to the North Star and it'll give you the conviction to do the right thing. As long as [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2084.64s)]
*  you're doing the right thing for the company, again, we can't, you know, can't be upset, really. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2088.24s)]
*  You can be disappointed. Things cannot work out. That happens everywhere. And that's life. So we [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2094.8799999999997s)]
*  got to figure out how to deal with the ups and downs. I think one of the most challenging things [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2102.0s)]
*  is also like figuring out when it doesn't work and being okay with it. Right. I think, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2105.84s)]
*  you know, culture is very funny. We have a culture book. I took the time to write a [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2114.8s)]
*  culture book and it's very important to Lou and I that everyone reads it because it's an expression [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2119.44s)]
*  of who we are. But, you know, we don't expect everyone to be the same. In fact, if you look at [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2125.6s)]
*  our team, it's very diverse, but we're all coalescing around the mission. So people are, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2130.4s)]
*  you know, you do those personality charts and they kind of fit all over the place. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2138.0800000000004s)]
*  So we try to get a good span. I think diversity of opinion and approach is important and frankly, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2142.0800000000004s)]
*  tension is important. I don't shy away from argument. I grew up in a very argumentative [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2147.92s)]
*  household. I think respect is one of those things where you tell someone what you really think and [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2153.0400000000004s)]
*  you don't hold back. That is the true definition of respect if you respect the other person. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2158.48s)]
*  So, you know, not everyone fits in and that's okay. And sometimes it can still work. But, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2164.32s)]
*  you know, it's hard. It's constant maintenance, but it's also exciting. It's also the most [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2172.2400000000002s)]
*  enjoyable part. So oftentimes there's always two, you know, faces of a coin. So the most [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2176.72s)]
*  enjoyable part, which is the people you work with, is also, you know, the thing that you have to [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2183.6s)]
*  invest the most time in also. Yeah. Well, thank you for indulging that follow-up question. I [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2190.4s)]
*  probably blindsided you with that one, but I appreciate it. It's fine. Like I said, I don't [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2195.84s)]
*  prepare. So these are just off the cuff. So you're getting what's in my brain for better. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2200.4s)]
*  That's awesome. All right. So I want to, in the time that we have left, I want to spend some time [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2206.08s)]
*  talking about the candidates that you guys are working on. Maybe get a clinical update on [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2211.92s)]
*  your candidates. And I don't know, you know, so you've done a good job sort of [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2220.2400000000002s)]
*  giving us an understanding of what democratization means and how that is being facilitated or enabled [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2227.12s)]
*  at Vaccinity. But maybe you can just give us a little bit, as we talk about each candidate, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2234.96s)]
*  maybe you can just give us a, along with a clinical update or preclinical, if they're [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2240.16s)]
*  preclinical candidates, maybe just a little bit of a commentary on, I guess, the [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2244.3999999999996s)]
*  democratized attributes of those specific candidates. Like how, you know, how you intend [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2252.08s)]
*  with those specific candidates to move that down the field. Yeah. We started talking about Alzheimer's. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2257.52s)]
*  So UB311 is your Alzheimer's vaccine candidate, received FDA fast track designation. Give us an [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2263.44s)]
*  update there. Yeah. So we've finished two phase, sorry, phase two in Alzheimer's and, you know, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2268.6400000000003s)]
*  it looks really promising. We're attacking what we think is the right target, these toxic [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2278.8s)]
*  alongomers before they, you know, try to get to the thing that's actually causing toxicity in the [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2285.12s)]
*  brain. And so in terms of clinical milestone, we're approved and we have a protocol for the next [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2289.2s)]
*  stage, which we're calling a phase two, B3, you know, at the FDA. And in terms of democratization, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2295.6s)]
*  I mean, what we're looking to do with the program is slow the process of, you know, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2305.36s)]
*  democratization. I mean, what we're looking to do with the program is slow the decline, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2310.56s)]
*  the cognitive decline, and ultimately slow the onset of actual Alzheimer's. So prevent Alzheimer's [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  before you even get there, right? But the democratization aspect is providing it where it [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2322.4s)]
*  can be accessible and convenient to everyone. So one of the things of prevention, and this, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2330.08s)]
*  not to jump around, but applies to all neurogenetic diseases, right? Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2336.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh, the field has moved towards prevention as the most effective way to tackle these. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2340.8s)]
*  But if you use a traditional monoclonal, it's very challenging. Okay. So imagine you're a healthy [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2346.8s)]
*  60 year old, and I have this proposition for you. Hey, I want you to go in for the rest of your life [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2354.08s)]
*  once a month and sit there for a couple hours and get infused with this antibody. You know, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2360.64s)]
*  hey, there might be some side effects like brain swelling, you know, dizziness, confusion. You're [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2365.52s)]
*  healthy, by the way, right? Not showing any symptoms. And by the way, it's going to cost [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2370.7200000000003s)]
*  you $50,000 a year plus infusion costs. You'd be like, what? I mean, I'll roll the dice. Thanks. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2374.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But when you move it to a vaccine, right? It's like the proposition changes. It's, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2383.44s)]
*  hey, you know what? I'm going to ask you to go in like once a year, maybe once a quarter and [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2389.44s)]
*  take something like a flu shot. You might even be able to get it at your local pharmacy, right? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2394.64s)]
*  It's safe. You know, you're not going to feel anything really, but it's going to be working [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2398.96s)]
*  in your brain to prevent these toxic proteins from forming. And guess what? Like it's nominal. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2403.44s)]
*  I don't want to put a price on it, but it's completely affordable, right? Less than your [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2411.7599999999998s)]
*  deductible. That's a much more palatable proposition for both the patient as well as the healthcare [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2416.0s)]
*  system. Right. And so that's where the democratization aspect comes from. Because [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2423.36s)]
*  of the technology, we're able to attack this Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease in a different [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2427.84s)]
*  way and make it accessible to everyone. So yeah, very good. And what's the, so that's [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2433.6s)]
*  fast track designation. You said you go into phase two, two B. Yeah, two B. So it's a well-powered [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2442.56s)]
*  efficacy study basically to show that we can reproduce the results that we had in our last [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2448.72s)]
*  phase two. So the other, you know, the phase two A, we showed awesome promising data that we can [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2454.72s)]
*  slow cognitive decline by 50%. But we want to do it in large numbers. So that's the idea. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2460.3999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, I think the safety is going to be important. The efficacy is important and not to [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2468.72s)]
*  bounce around, but I like to bucket them. We're in our Parkinson's trial right now. We're just [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2474.88s)]
*  finishing up our phase one part B in actual patients. And the goal there is to show that [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2478.8s)]
*  one, it's safe, but that the vaccine does what we intended to do, which is get your body to be a [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2483.84s)]
*  bioreactor, develop these antibodies against really specific, you know, toxic proteins in your brain [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  that can cross the blood brain barrier into the CSF where this action's happening and that we can [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2495.6800000000003s)]
*  do it safely. So that's UB 312, the Parkinson's candidate, correct? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We're trying [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2502.24s)]
*  to get better at naming. Yeah. And while now I just, you know, I figured I'd throw it out there [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2509.52s)]
*  for reference in case anyone wants to do any follow-up research on these candidates. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2514.56s)]
*  And then you still got the COVID-19 booster candidate. Is that, so that's UB 612. Is that [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2519.04s)]
*  COVID-19 booster? Is that like a remnant or a carry on from the COVAX days? Yeah. Yeah. It's [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2525.76s)]
*  the same product that we started developing COVAX. You know, it's a heterologous booster, right? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2533.0400000000004s)]
*  And the trial, we're in a phase three platform, global platform trial. The idea is we're showing [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2541.6800000000003s)]
*  that we can boost other technologies. So we can boost mRNA vaccines. If you had an AZ vaccine, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2547.76s)]
*  we could boost that. If you've had it inactivated like Sinovac, Sinopharm, we can boost that. So [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2553.04s)]
*  we're showing that we could basically be a universal booster. You know, why does it matter? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2557.52s)]
*  It's because COVID is still out there. A number of reasons. COVID's, you know, still out there. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2563.2799999999997s)]
*  It's probably not going to leave us. We're already getting into this mindset of, you know, regular [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2568.48s)]
*  boosters. And there are some key differentiators for a vaccine. The one that I think is super [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2572.88s)]
*  important that, you know, time will tell is safety, right? Ours don't really have that same [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2579.28s)]
*  reactogenicity. It doesn't get you flu-like symptoms. It's, you know, less than 10% of people [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2586.0800000000004s)]
*  get these systemic responses like putting you out for the day. And I think that makes a difference. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2590.32s)]
*  You know, and from the efficacy side, we seem to have really good resilience against mutations. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2598.96s)]
*  So, you know, we tested against alpha, beta, delta, gamma, Omicron, Omicron 2. And we get really nice [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2603.92s)]
*  responses. And it's probably because of the regions that we're selecting are conserved. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2612.7200000000003s)]
*  And then lastly is distributability, right? I think we mentioned before, but we want to be [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2620.48s)]
*  able to get to every corner of the world that needs it. So. Yep. Yep. Very good. Those are all [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2625.92s)]
*  important points, particularly around, you know, patient response and those mutations. I mean, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2632.16s)]
*  just keep going. I was recently on a family vacation to Florida and I came home and I was [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2642.24s)]
*  ill. It turned out it wasn't COVID, but I was so convinced that, you know, it was some new [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2648.48s)]
*  mutation from, you know, from Florida where mutation seems to have run. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2654.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. You know, one other thing that I forgot to mention is actually durability is important. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2659.04s)]
*  Yeah. So it's not just that we're protecting against mutations, but that we do it for, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2664.96s)]
*  you know, a reasonable period of time. So the data will tell, but our initial data seems like [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2669.92s)]
*  we got, you know, pretty long durability, probably, you know, twice as much as mRNA, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2675.3599999999997s)]
*  maybe three even longer than the other one. So it would be nice if we didn't have to go in all the [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2682.08s)]
*  time and be worrying all the time. Sure. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Booster fatigue is real and it's not, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2687.68s)]
*  you know, it's not going to go away. So durability is important. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. And then, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2693.8399999999997s)]
*  okay. So then there are a couple others, UB313 for migraine. You want to talk about that or the [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2699.8399999999997s)]
*  PCSK9 program? You tell me what other programs are you working on? These are awesome programs. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2708.3199999999997s)]
*  And they don't, they haven't gotten as much, you know, light, but they're, you know, some of my [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2714.08s)]
*  favorite, you know, everyone says that they don't have a favorite child, but they have, you know, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2720.4s)]
*  children, you know, are exceptional for different reasons. Yeah. So CGRP and PCSK9 are the essence [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2727.2s)]
*  of democratization because, and the displacement of monoclonal antibodies. Okay. So both of these [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2734.64s)]
*  programs have approved monoclonals on the market, but they're expensive. And they're, as a result, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2741.52s)]
*  they're none of them are first line treatments. Right. So for migraine and for both of these, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2750.4s)]
*  we go head to head with the monoclonals in our studies, and we want to make sure that we have [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2755.12s)]
*  similar efficacy as them. But the difference, the democratization aspect is that we can produce them [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2760.48s)]
*  at a fraction of the cost. So our cost of goods is like 1% or less than a monoclonal. And they [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2767.2s)]
*  become very convenient. So rather than, you know, self-injecting every month or even going in for [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2774.56s)]
*  infusions, this is like an IM injection, just like a flu shot, right? And they last a long time. So [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2781.52s)]
*  the durability, it's like a long acting biologic. So they're convenient to patients. And that's where [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2787.68s)]
*  the real accessibility comes in. So ultimately, you know, that's where we think we have this [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2795.28s)]
*  major advantage and we want them to become the first choice. So for UB313, which is our migraine, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2802.7200000000003s)]
*  we want it to become the first choice for migraine sufferers around the world, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2808.2400000000002s)]
*  to reclaim their lives. And we want to be able to bring the beauty of the CGRP mechanism, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2813.28s)]
*  which is currently only available to, you know, US and developed world, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2819.28s)]
*  to the rest of the world, because migraine is everywhere. With PCSK9, I don't know how much [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2824.08s)]
*  you know about this, but this is one of the most consistent biologies at reducing cholesterol, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2830.08s)]
*  which has shown to be able to ultimately reduce, you know, cardiac events and death. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2835.92s)]
*  So imagine being able to vaccinate the world against heart attack and stroke, right? As a [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2844.08s)]
*  first line treatment to be able to go out there and, you know, improve the convenience off of [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2850.64s)]
*  statins and, you know, match them or even beat them on price. You can vaccinate the world against [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2855.92s)]
*  heart attack and stroke and eliminate, you know, majority of heart disease, which is still our [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2862.08s)]
*  leading killer, which is crazy because we know how to eliminate it. So that's why I get super [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2868.8799999999997s)]
*  pumped up about these two programs. The biology is already well understood. So the probability [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2874.08s)]
*  of success is super high, but we're just coming in with a different technology, a different approach [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2879.76s)]
*  that is really harnessing this democratization aspect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You, I don't get the [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2884.8s)]
*  sense that you get too excited about the little stuff. I mean, I don't mean that in a critical [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2894.7200000000003s)]
*  way, but like you, it's clear to me that Meimei Hu is excited by big challenges that need to be [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2900.0s)]
*  addressed, like the big picture stuff. Well, I get excited by all sorts of stuff, but yeah, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2908.24s)]
*  the big picture stuff is stuff that challenges me all the time. So yeah, and it's a thing that [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2913.2s)]
*  requires a team. So it's just fun. You know, it's fun to be challenged every day and it's fun to be [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2920.08s)]
*  working on something that is so much larger than yourself that you can never figure out all by [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2928.3199999999997s)]
*  yourself. And so it's constantly a puzzle and keeps life interesting. Yeah. I've been all of, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2933.52s)]
*  I've taken you all over the map in this conversation. You know, I keep shifting gears. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2941.36s)]
*  I keep having those shiny moments where I, you know, take us off track. What have I missed? What [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2945.12s)]
*  have I failed to ask you that's important to the vaccine story that you might want to conclude with [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2951.52s)]
*  and make sure that you get across? Oh, I think you've done an awesome job. I love just the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2956.8s)]
*  authenticity of the conversation. I'm just like, you know, you know, going back and forth. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2962.24s)]
*  You know, our story is pretty simple at the end of the day. And it's, you know, I hate to [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2968.4799999999996s)]
*  beat it again. It's just, it's democratizing health and through technology, right? Technology has [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2973.52s)]
*  enabled every major transformation in history. So to think that it's not going to be a technology [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2980.56s)]
*  that does that again is crazy. And I acknowledge that what we're doing is bold and lots of people [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2987.6s)]
*  say it's crazy. It's an unorthodox business model, especially in biotech. But it doesn't mean that [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2993.36s)]
*  it's not worth doing. Yeah. So our biggest challenge is sharing the story and showing people that [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=2999.12s)]
*  it's possible and that it makes sense and that it's worth doing. And so I thank you for, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3007.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, this conversation allowing another platform to kind of show that. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3014.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm happy to. Like I said, I was intrigued by you and your leadership style [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3020.32s)]
*  and your company and the work that you and Lou are doing. You know, a couple of years ago when [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3026.0s)]
*  it was Rob Wright, who I think he did like an executive virtual round table featuring you. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3031.68s)]
*  And then as I may have noted, I don't know if I noted it while we were recording or not, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3037.44s)]
*  but if listeners are interested in Vaccinity and Maymay and the work that she and Lou are doing, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3041.04s)]
*  they were featured on the cover of Life Science Leader. I don't recall if I have exactly what [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3047.04s)]
*  issue that was, but it was, I think within the last year, Life Science Leader cover story. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3054.16s)]
*  Yeah. It was last year sometime. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3058.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So check that out. But yeah, thank you. Thank you for entertaining my question. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3061.04s)]
*  I do want to have you back on the show again, because, you know, as you were talking, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3066.96s)]
*  I kept on coming up with follow up questions that perhaps would take us down into a different world [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3071.6s)]
*  that would warrant their own 40 minute or 50 minute conversation, like around financing and [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3077.92s)]
*  fundraising, for instance, in your IPL. Because when you do unorthodox things and have great big [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3082.96s)]
*  visions, you know, it takes a certain kind of investment community to get behind that. And [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3088.0s)]
*  I want to learn more about that, how you've kind of gone down that path, but not right now. So [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3093.52s)]
*  I'm going to just throw that teaser out there. I'll have you back on the show at some point when [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3097.84s)]
*  you're ready to talk about that. But I enjoyed it as well. I appreciate the time. We'll be [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3102.4s)]
*  paying attention to you guys. And as I said, hopefully catch up with you again soon. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3107.44s)]
*  Awesome. I'd love to. And anytime. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFmpPZ0JBc&t=3111.52s)]
