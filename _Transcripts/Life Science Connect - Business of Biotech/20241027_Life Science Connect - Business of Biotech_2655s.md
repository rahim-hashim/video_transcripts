Video Description: It might just be coincidence, but it sure seems like Bill Enright has a knack for making big moves at inopportune times, then turning the expected outcome on its ear. For example, he signed on as CEO at Altimmune when the company was struggling mightily. Enright had a turnaround plan in hand, but as he was in the thick of a non-deal road show to execute said plan, Lehmen Brothers collapsed. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, we'll learn in great detail how Altimmune escaped that death knell. Later, he joined his current company, Barinthus Biotherapeutics, mere months before the Covid pandemic. That was shaky for a hot minute, but it turned out fortuitous when, against his better judgment, he enabled a pivot that became foundational to the company's go-forward plan. We'll learn how he flipped the script on that crisis, too. Tune in for these, and other harrowing tales from the trenches.

# Building On Pandemic Progress With Barinthus Biotherapeutics' Bill Enright
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [October 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4)
*  Welcome back to the Business of Biotech, your weekly dose of personal insight from the biotech [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=0.0s)]
*  builders on the front lines. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=9.6s)]
*  Where we don't just cover the trends influencing the space, we get to know the people who are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=11.48s)]
*  setting those trends. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=15.82s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller and I have a lot in common with our guest today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=17.6s)]
*  We both grew up in and around Buffalo, New York. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=21.78s)]
*  He's a University at Buffalo grad, as am I, and he's currently shoveling money into Penn [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=25.44s)]
*  State's coffers to fund his son's education there, as am I. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Bill Enright took his UB Master's in Biology to the biopharmaceutical industry, earned [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  an MS in Business Management at Johns Hopkins, and it was off to the races from there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=42.64s)]
*  He's held leadership positions at a number of biotechs, including executive and C-suite [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=49.0s)]
*  roles at Life Technologies, Altimmune, Genvec, Avidia, and Gravitas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=53.88s)]
*  Today, he's more than five years into his tenure as CEO at Barenthus Biotherapeutics, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=60.88s)]
*  where he's overseeing a portfolio of clinical stage immunotherapeutics for hepatitis B and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=67.84s)]
*  celiac disease. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=74.56s)]
*  On today's episode, we're going to get to know Bill. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=76.44s)]
*  We're going to dig into a few of the inflection points that have shaped his career, and more [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=78.64s)]
*  importantly, we'll explore how he navigated those inflection points. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=83.44s)]
*  Bill, welcome to the show. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm looking forward to the conversation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  As am I. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=93.64s)]
*  Yeah, a couple of Western New York boys getting back together, talking shop. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=94.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  That was a fun game in Miami Thursday night. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  It sure was. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=101.68s)]
*  Yeah, this episode is going to drop in a few weeks from now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=102.68s)]
*  So just for the listeners' references, you know, if you want to, the listeners' references, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=105.88s)]
*  you want to go back and watch that game. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=109.8s)]
*  You and I were both reveling in that victory, I'm sure. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=111.44s)]
*  So Bill, thanks again for joining the show. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  And I want to kind of start with a conversation about, you know, your beginnings in management [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=117.44s)]
*  and executive leadership in biotech. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=124.84s)]
*  Because you know, as I said, you got your your your bio masters at UB. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=127.84s)]
*  Your first exposure to biopharma looks like it was at Life Technologies, which is now [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=133.28s)]
*  part of Thermo Fisher Scientific. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=137.18s)]
*  It looks like that's kind of where you started to transition maybe a bit from scientific [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=139.32s)]
*  research into business development. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  So tell us a little bit about that transition. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=146.84s)]
*  What motivated it? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=149.84s)]
*  And maybe we'll get in a little bit into how you navigated that move. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=151.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly where it started. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=156.24s)]
*  So I had the good fortune of being with Life Technologies, which was, you know, a fairly [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=160.52s)]
*  large organization at the time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=166.24s)]
*  They had a pretty unique opportunity where they would set up incubator companies within [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=169.12s)]
*  the larger organization. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=175.96s)]
*  So they would put manufacturing, marketing, distribution, everything, research kind of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  like in a wing of a building and in a new area that they wanted to explore and give [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=185.24s)]
*  the team an opportunity to see if they could create value in that space. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  And so I joined this cell and cell biology group as part of that running the manufacturing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=198.64s)]
*  team for that incubator company. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=207.44s)]
*  And that's when I really figured out that that I really like the business side of science. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  And so went went back and had the opportunity to get my master's degree from Johns Hopkins [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  at the Cary School and then transitioned into more business roles within Life Technologies. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  So started out as a business analyst and then was a product line business manager, more [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=232.0s)]
*  of a marketing role for that organization. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  So that's where really the transition occurred. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=241.6s)]
*  It's interesting, you know, I think about now, I don't want to age you, Bill, but I [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  say that your departure from UB came just a few years before mine. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=249.4s)]
*  I'm curious, like when you were there earning your master's degree in biology, was there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=255.4s)]
*  any like, you know, more than likely with the intent to move into some business role, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=261.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, a role with a biologics business or in industry, was there any exposure to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=269.0s)]
*  the business side of biology, like what you could do on the business side with a career? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=276.76s)]
*  Not at all. Absolutely not. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=281.24s)]
*  Everything was geared towards academia. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=283.56s)]
*  It was an even industry at that point. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=285.88s)]
*  You know, it was, yeah, you're going to get your PhD to go into an academic job. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=288.68s)]
*  Yeah. So at what point, like, did you, you had no idea, like when you were exposed to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=296.44s)]
*  that incubator environment, going into that, you really had no idea that, hey, there might be [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=302.28s)]
*  a bit of a business minded or entrepreneurial minded element of Bill in, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  No, it really triggers them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=314.44s)]
*  That really was the start of that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=317.64s)]
*  And, you know, I've been in the biotech space over 35 years now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  And that really kind of triggered it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=326.28s)]
*  Yeah. Did you, when you went and got the masters from Johns Hopkins, did you do that with the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=330.68s)]
*  intent to just commit and perhaps set yourself up for ensuing positions? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=339.48s)]
*  As I noted, you know, you went on to Genvec and Altimmune and others. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=345.88s)]
*  Was that sort of the MO at the time? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=350.68s)]
*  You know, I'm not one of these guys that really planned out my career. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=355.0s)]
*  I don't think I could have planned it out if I tried, to be honest. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=358.52s)]
*  I was pretty opportunistic and not afraid to take chances. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, I've told people before, I've never held a job that I've had before [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=370.84s)]
*  in my whole life since I was a teenager. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=377.79999999999995s)]
*  So, you know, it's always been something new, something I've never done before. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=381.24s)]
*  And, you know, even with the multiple CEO roles, it was, you know, so first time CEO [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=387.16s)]
*  at Altimmune, it's been out from the University of Alabama, Birmingham. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  And then the second CEO role is a UK company. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, commuting across the pond and so, you know, very different kind of roles. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=404.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Would you advise folks who are in the process of transitioning from science or [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  research-based careers into business management careers? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  Would you advise them to take the track that you did and say, you know what, I'm going to go get [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=424.52000000000004s)]
*  the masters, you know, I'm going to commit to the business? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  Or are there other routes or paths that in retrospect you might suggest are good ideas? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=431.88000000000005s)]
*  Oh, I mean, there's certainly lots of different paths, but I found that one very helpful. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=438.12s)]
*  So, going back and getting my business degree really allowed me to speak a number of foreign [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  languages like finance and marketing and those kind of things, which really have a different [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=451.56s)]
*  vocabulary to science. And I found them very, very useful. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=458.12s)]
*  And, you know, as a result, I do give back a lot to the Carey School. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=465.0s)]
*  So, I do a lot of work with them mentoring and judging science competitions or business [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=471.64s)]
*  competitions rather. And I was on the Dean's Alumni Advisory Board for about a decade and in the, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=481.55999999999995s)]
*  you know, alumni associations and things like that. So, still do a lot of work with the business [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=489.16s)]
*  school because I really think that was a major factor in kind of transitioning my career. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=494.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. It's interesting that you say, you know, you've held multiple now CEO roles, but you've [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  never had the same job you had before. I imagine that's probably more true in biotech than in most [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=506.36s)]
*  other industries where the experience, I mean, there are some fundamentals and we'll get into [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=514.8399999999999s)]
*  some of the fundamentals and how you handle those fundamentals. But I would imagine that, you know, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=519.72s)]
*  it's one thing if you're the CEO of a company that's in a certain class of widget making [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  in biotech, boy, it's going to be, you know, seeing some of this for the first time myself [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=532.4399999999999s)]
*  here, no matter how many CEO roles you've had. No, I absolutely agree. You've got a wonderful [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=536.36s)]
*  opportunity, especially when you're working with smaller organizations, to learn many different [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=543.56s)]
*  aspects of the business and kind of figure out where your aptitude is and, you know, what you [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  like to do. Yeah. You said Altamune was your first CEO role? Correct. Correct. Yeah. And that was [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=559.4799999999999s)]
*  a doozy, man. Like I look at that and you told me when we talked earlier, you told me that you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  joined Altamune in June 2008. That's right. Recruited by a CEO who said, you know what, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=574.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm looking to scale things back a little bit. Bill, I think you're a good fit for this job. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  Are you interested? And in retrospect, if I didn't know any better, if I thought the guy had bad [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=587.48s)]
*  intentions, I might suggest that he knew that something was brewing and that in September of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=592.44s)]
*  that year, Lehman Brothers would crash and you'd be at the helm of a company that was, you know, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=599.08s)]
*  facing the worst economic situation that you and I at that point had seen in our lifetimes, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  for sure. So tell me about that. I don't know. Like I could ask you, I could start asking you [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=612.2800000000001s)]
*  questions, but tell me that story. That was a pretty interesting time. So, you know, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=617.48s)]
*  it was exactly as you said, how I came into the role, you know, and Beech-Hool acquaintance put [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=623.88s)]
*  us together. And so I was on my first non-deal roadshow, you know, trying to get out. I really [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=629.88s)]
*  took a chance with Altamune. They had a very limited balance sheet at the time. A number of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=638.84s)]
*  folks down in Birmingham with lab facilities, lab and office facilities down there in an incubator [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=646.28s)]
*  space. And, you know, I thought I could come in and raise some money pretty quickly and really [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=653.64s)]
*  help the company. And then, you know, all hell broke loose, as you noted. And so ended up having [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=659.16s)]
*  to restructure the organization, scale down the number of labs and things like that. It took a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=670.36s)]
*  year without salary. It helped provide a loan for the company and to keep things afloat. And actually, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=679.4s)]
*  some of the tax initiatives that Obama initiated really were the savior for the company for a little [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  while. And then one of the contracts that we were working on came through. And it was really, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=698.68s)]
*  it was pretty much touch and go for the company. It was in April and negotiating a potential sale [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=707.2399999999999s)]
*  of the company to a publicly listed company. And it was a terrible deal because we were on, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=718.12s)]
*  you know, the thrills of shutting the doors. And Friday afternoon, I was talking to my board and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=723.56s)]
*  said, okay, we have a sunset clause in this agreement. So we have to decide by Monday whether [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=729.3199999999999s)]
*  we're taking the deal or we're going to close the doors. And so the board agreed to take the deal. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=736.8399999999999s)]
*  And I hung up the call from the board and opened my emails. And I had an email in there from Barta [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=744.92s)]
*  about a defense contract for an internationally administered anthrax vaccine that we had been [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=751.8s)]
*  developing. And the same, we won a pretty significant contract award. And so I called back [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=758.3599999999999s)]
*  the board and said, I've got new information. I said, we won't be able to start getting revenue [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=767.0s)]
*  until September. Not sure how we'll get from April to September. But then the board said, you know, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=772.28s)]
*  tell that company to go pound sand. We'll figure out a way to get from here to September. And [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=779.48s)]
*  I was able to bring in a loan from one of the local Birmingham banks to help keep the lights [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  on and the doors open through the course of summer. And all of my employees went without [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=795.48s)]
*  salary for the summer and then made it happen. And that contract led to some interest from [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=801.08s)]
*  a number of VCs. And we did a merger with a UK based company and we were able to get the company [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=810.44s)]
*  public and continues to grow now. And now the company's still a lot and doing well. Much [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=819.48s)]
*  different area than when I was CEO. They're focused in GOP1, in anti-obesity, in NASH. But [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=826.12s)]
*  they were able to do that because of the funding and stuff and the data that we had in our programs [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=836.28s)]
*  enabled them to continue to pivot and move, which is again, one of the nice things about being in [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=842.52s)]
*  biotech. Yeah. Yeah. Now that's, I mean, that just opens up a whole slew of questions. I mean, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=849.48s)]
*  to hear you tell that story, you know, one might seize upon the fortuitous nature of things like, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=857.0s)]
*  you know, this offer from BARDA, for instance, you know, one might go, oh, well, things look [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=866.6s)]
*  pretty dire there. They got lucky. But there's more to it than that. Like there's a story of [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=871.8000000000001s)]
*  perseverance there. I mean, obviously when you take a job like that, you take a job like that, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=877.24s)]
*  you know, as I said in June and by September, everything's falling apart around you. Because [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=881.48s)]
*  everything's falling apart around you, it probably wouldn't have been easy for Biller and Wright to [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=887.08s)]
*  say, I'm going to jump ship because you looked around and all the other ships were sinking too. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=890.92s)]
*  Like there's not really a safe ship to jump onto, right? So I get that, you know, part of it's like, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=895.96s)]
*  well, I'm here now, let's do what we can. But dig a little bit deeper into, I guess, some of the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=900.44s)]
*  moves that you made, decisions that you made that kept the thing afloat. I mean, you know, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=908.04s)]
*  you hinted at some pretty shoestring measures just to keep things going. But share a little [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=917.32s)]
*  bit more about, you know, how even personal anecdotes about how you, you know, personally [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=922.6s)]
*  got through that time, you know, accepted it, embraced it and figured out, you know, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=930.52s)]
*  hey, the sun's going to come up another day. Yeah, so it's looking back was probably definitely with [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=934.92s)]
*  my heart and not my head. You know, I mean, I just I believed in the technology, thought we can make [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=942.68s)]
*  something happen and was willing to go after it. And luckily for me, I had a supportive wife. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=948.04s)]
*  So, you know, I did get I did go a year without salary. And like I said, I ended up, you know, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=955.48s)]
*  putting collateral up for my house as a as a loan for the company to make things happen. And, you [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=966.28s)]
*  know, that that ended up turning the corner for us. So, like you said, perseverance is a huge part of it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=974.28s)]
*  Several folks that that I've interacted with over my career said I'm like a dog with a bone. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=981.96s)]
*  So I'm not going to give it up. So, yeah, I could have bailed. I probably could have bailed sooner. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=988.2800000000001s)]
*  That was one of the that was one of the calculus when I was taking the job, to be honest, was [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=995.88s)]
*  like, if the company's in a bad financial situation, if I can come in and turn this thing around, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=999.88s)]
*  if I can come in and turn this thing around, that looks pretty good. If I fail quickly, then, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1005.4s)]
*  you know, probably not too much of a mark on me because of where they were when I came in. But [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1012.52s)]
*  when you're in it for a couple of years and then you start failing, then it's then it's on you, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1020.52s)]
*  you know, so I wasn't going to let that happen. That was that was that was my mantra. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1025.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, you go and think and if we fail quickly, then, hey, I can recover and [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1031.5600000000002s)]
*  move on. And then all of a sudden you have this failure accelerator set in and you're and you [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1035.88s)]
*  still won't give up the bone. So kudos to you on that. I'm curious. There's one more question [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1040.1200000000001s)]
*  about that. You mentioned that, you know, your staff went for a summer without salary. So I'm [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1045.64s)]
*  curious. I'm curious about, you know, your leadership during that particular summer. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1052.04s)]
*  You're the captain of the ship and you're telling the crew like, hey, you know, you're not going to [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1058.3600000000001s)]
*  get anything to eat for a while. That's a that's an easy inflection point for a mutiny using the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1063.72s)]
*  ship analogy. No, it really is. And, you know, again, you know, biotech is a lot about selling [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1071.16s)]
*  the dream, right? I mean, we're most of us are non revenue generating. You're selling a promise of [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1078.5200000000002s)]
*  what can come based on the technology that you have, based on the data, based on the vision that [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1085.4s)]
*  you have. And my team could see the vision, right? They knew we had a contract out there. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1090.52s)]
*  So it wasn't indefinite, you know, you're not going to get salary until something happens. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  You're not going to get salary until this point when we start getting, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1103.8000000000002s)]
*  when the contract becomes active and things like that. So, you know, they were willing to plow [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1107.96s)]
*  through it and they trusted that, you know, they'd be able to get their back pay and we were able to [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1114.68s)]
*  do that and make it all even again. And so and then some because they got, you know, they got equity [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1121.8s)]
*  as a result in taking the sacrifices that they made. And so they were able to share [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1134.8400000000001s)]
*  as the company was successful. I think in the end, you know, everybody got rewarded. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1142.04s)]
*  How important was it to you that at the time that those folks saw you putting your own skin in the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1149.1599999999999s)]
*  game and putting your own livelihood and, you know, personal life on the line? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1156.68s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that shows conviction. They really understood that I was [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1162.04s)]
*  convinced that the technology had a place and that we were going to ultimately be successful. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1168.84s)]
*  And so I think they were willing to stand behind me. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1175.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's that that's how Western New York blue collar mentality is setting. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1178.84s)]
*  The grit, the the buffalonian grit right there. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1184.9199999999998s)]
*  There you go. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1187.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So I, you know, we could we could kind of go step by step and you can share, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1189.0s)]
*  you know, stories from the stops between Altamune and and Berenthus if you'd like. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1194.44s)]
*  But if I fast forward to your arrival at Berenthus, what five five, five ish, five plus years ago. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1199.0s)]
*  Yeah, five plus years now. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1205.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. What was the what was the sort of the the origin story of Bill's arrival at Berenthus? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1206.76s)]
*  Well, I decided to leave Altamune where my that first CEO role was after almost 11 years. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1213.56s)]
*  So we had just gotten very good phase two clinical data in two different programs. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1222.2s)]
*  We'd raised a bunch of money. So they had a couple of years where the calf, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1227.8s)]
*  I thought they were in a good place. And I just felt that I needed to try and figure out what was [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1231.56s)]
*  next for me. So I took some time to try and do that. And a friend of mine was interviewing for [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1236.6000000000001s)]
*  a CEO role at a company in Oxford in the UK and asked me to be a reference. And so I was a reference [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1246.68s)]
*  for him. And at the end of the conversation, the recruiter said, you know, so what are you doing? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1256.6000000000001s)]
*  And so we talked through that and she said, I think I have a job for you, actually. And so [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1262.68s)]
*  that led to coming on board at Berenthus. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1269.3200000000002s)]
*  That wasn't the job that you were referring your friend to, was it? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1272.8400000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1275.88s)]
*  You didn't you didn't pull that. I pulled my position right out from under my body. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1276.36s)]
*  He got that job also. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1281.6399999999999s)]
*  Very good. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1283.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But so it was it was kind of a similar situation. The first time the first CEO [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1284.84s)]
*  that helped found the company at Berenthus was was much more of a scientist than he was a [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1292.36s)]
*  fundraiser and and company builder. He'd done both many times, but that's not where his [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1300.68s)]
*  his preference lied. And so when when we were looking at a potential series B [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1308.04s)]
*  and the desire to go public, he basically told the board, which were his main investors, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1314.6000000000001s)]
*  I hate talking to investors and I hate talking to the board. So you better find someone who likes it. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1322.52s)]
*  So and so he he moved into the chief scientific operating role and officer role. And and I came [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1327.24s)]
*  on board as the CEO. Again, interesting transition when you've got the former CEO still part of the [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1336.76s)]
*  company. But again, you know, we were able to work really, really well together. Still good friends [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1342.68s)]
*  with with both of those guys, actually. And, you know, amazingly, I joined in August of 2019 [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1350.12s)]
*  and January, COVID happened. Yeah. And and that was a huge transition for the company. So, you know, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1362.52s)]
*  it was a really interesting time because we actually had the company was started as a flu [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1371.8s)]
*  vaccine company and we had two phase two trials that were reading out in January. And and both of [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1377.0s)]
*  those trials were not not successful. From a data perspective, they read out on time and on budget. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1386.28s)]
*  And so there were successful trials, just the data wasn't good. Yeah. And at the same time, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1396.28s)]
*  you know, our technology was really applicable to COVID. And in my my CSO, Tom came and said, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1402.92s)]
*  hey, there's this interesting virus that's that's spreading in China. And I think we should pay [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1410.52s)]
*  attention to this and start doing something here. And I said, No, I said, we've we've got [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1416.2s)]
*  our therapeutic programs that we're moving forward. We've got to get these things, you know, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1424.28s)]
*  we don't need that distraction. And he said, No, no, I really think this is this is going [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1429.08s)]
*  to be a major deal and we need to we need to get involved here. And I so I said, OK, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1433.56s)]
*  I'll give you fifty thousand dollars to to do kind of the initial work on on this stuff. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1442.76s)]
*  And then we'll see how this plays out. Because, you know, all the other pandemics that have emerged [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1450.84s)]
*  so far, age five and one, three and two, you know, all these SARS, none of them have turned [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1456.2s)]
*  into real commercial opportunities. And that was my fear that we were going to spend, you know, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1462.68s)]
*  get distracted and it isn't a real commercial opportunity. But, you know, as history clearly [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1467.0s)]
*  showed, it turned into a major deal. And we were able to move really, really quickly. And, you [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1473.16s)]
*  know, the sequence for the virus came out in mid-January. We had phase two slash three [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1479.6399999999999s)]
*  clinical trials enrolling in April and we're able to outlicense that to AstraZeneca. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1485.8s)]
*  Clearly, you want to get big pharma involved when you're talking about large scale manufacturing [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1492.9199999999998s)]
*  and distribution. That's that's really what they're really good at. And so, you know, we [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1498.2s)]
*  outlicensed this vaccine to AstraZeneca through the University of Oxford. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1503.3200000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, involved in the invention and the early development. And then we got some royalties [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1509.0800000000002s)]
*  out of it. So it was good non-dilutive funding, very solid validation of the platform, very solid [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1514.28s)]
*  validation of the safety profile of the platform. So a lot of benefits for the company in, you know, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1521.4s)]
*  multiple areas. And because we outlicensed it so quickly, also not too distracted. So that was [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1529.64s)]
*  also helpful and allowed us to continue the development work and what we've got going on [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1539.16s)]
*  right now, which is primarily in HBV and Celiac. Those are the two core programs that we have [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1543.88s)]
*  ongoing right now. Yeah, it occurs to me that if there was ever a time for bad data to, you know, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1551.24s)]
*  if there was ever a time to receive bad clinical data, that was probably it because, you know, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1560.2s)]
*  something was upending everything anyway. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So that was we were [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1565.1599999999999s)]
*  fortunate in that regard to, you know, people didn't really pay attention to the bad data [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1571.1599999999999s)]
*  too much because of everything else that was going on. And the fact that we were, you know, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1575.56s)]
*  we already had a program with a different coronavirus in MERS and we're continuing to [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1581.8s)]
*  develop that program with funding from CEPI, which is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1587.88s)]
*  And so they're funding that program. And so that's moving along in the background. But as I said, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1595.24s)]
*  you know, we've got a potential functional cure for hepatitis B. And in that program, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1601.5600000000002s)]
*  we announced really promising, probably best in class data in the industry at a recent [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1606.92s)]
*  major liver conference. We'll have more data from that coming up later this year. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1614.68s)]
*  And then we've got a really interesting technology that we acquired from a Baltimore based company [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1620.1200000000001s)]
*  that we acquired that that we're moving into celiac disease. And that program, we hope to [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1627.48s)]
*  dose our first patient here very, very soon. So it's passed. It's cleared the FDA to get the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1634.68s)]
*  trial enrolling and we've got sites initiated and we're screening patients. So hopefully we'll get [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1643.16s)]
*  that move in very, very quickly. And so, yeah, we've got an exciting platform and [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1650.52s)]
*  exciting programs moving forward. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1660.76s)]
*  Yeah. I want to jump back real quick to that, you know, that point when you said it was your CFO [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1662.92s)]
*  who came along and said, hey, we... [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1670.76s)]
*  CSO. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1672.76s)]
*  CSO. Okay. The CSO at the time was still the former... [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1673.6399999999999s)]
*  It was, yeah. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1678.04s)]
*  So he comes along and I mean, you know, he says, hey, this is something we should be paying [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1680.28s)]
*  attention to. So I'm going to give you the leadership lesson that I take away from this [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1684.92s)]
*  experience, this story, this anecdote, and see if you agree and what you might add to it. So I take [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1689.32s)]
*  away from that story the metered approach to a potentially conflicting or, you know, an [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1697.64s)]
*  opportunity, potentially conflicting or distracting opportunity, taking a metered approach to it, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1709.5600000000002s)]
*  maybe shelving ego. Like, hey, this is a former CEO saying we should be doing this. And I'm like, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1715.5600000000002s)]
*  hey, I'm setting the direction for the company now. I don't think so. Shelve that for a minute, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1720.5200000000002s)]
*  take a metered approach. And the metered approach in this case certainly paid off for [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1723.96s)]
*  Brent this and it helped set you up to, you know, to make transitions toward what you're [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1729.0s)]
*  working on now. Would you agree? Is that sort of the... [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1733.4s)]
*  No, that's absolutely fair assessment. I mean, like you said, you know, initially, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1736.1200000000001s)]
*  the initial thing was looking... I don't look at this as a commercial opportunity [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1741.0s)]
*  at this juncture. I mean, it was so early. I mean, again, when he came to me, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1747.0s)]
*  we didn't even know the viral sequence yet. I mean, he was totally on top of this. He's [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1753.56s)]
*  an infectious disease MD by training, kind of stays on top of that space. And so he was very [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1759.56s)]
*  knowledgeable about what was going on elsewhere in the world. And, you know, he'd seen a lot of [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1767.8s)]
*  these other pandemics come and go as well and thought this was different. And so he pushed hard [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1774.44s)]
*  in order to get any kind of funding and in a word to even start the work. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1780.3600000000001s)]
*  And the board was okay with that even after he told them that he was tired of working with them [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1786.76s)]
*  and didn't want to raise money anymore. Yeah, it was, you know, it was an R&D expenditure [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1790.6000000000001s)]
*  that didn't go to the board initially because it was a small amount. But when we started, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1796.28s)]
*  then, you know, when things actually look like it was becoming a major deal, then quickly went [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1801.24s)]
*  to the board to make sure that they were aware that we know what we had going on and where we [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1807.8s)]
*  thought we could play. Yeah. So just to rewind here, you know, you joined the company when [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1812.6s)]
*  it was at a fundraising inflection point that, you know, you were the right guy for the job for. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1823.08s)]
*  Yeah, you took the company public. When did that happen? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1828.0400000000002s)]
*  May of 21. May of 21. Yeah. So you take the company public, you know, you've built a pretty [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1836.0400000000002s)]
*  healthy cash runway. And the last time you and I talked, though, you opened up a little bit about [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1847.0s)]
*  the fact that you did recently have to do a reorg, right, which is not uncommon. Like a lot [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1853.48s)]
*  of companies are going through that right now. And not only is it not uncommon, but it's not [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1858.84s)]
*  infrequent, right? Like these shuffles happen quite frequently. But I'm just curious if you could spend [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1863.8s)]
*  some time talking about that reprioritization and how it's informing the go-forward plan and what [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1870.6s)]
*  you're working on now, starting with like what prompted it? Like what was the impetus for that [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1875.88s)]
*  reorg? So the impetus is really following the data, right? So we had a program in human [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1881.88s)]
*  papillomavirus that we were moving forward, got to phase two, and we got a readout. And it was a [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1889.24s)]
*  dose escalation trial. And I would say, you know, if you look at the top dose, there's potentially [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1897.0s)]
*  activity there. It's going to require a lot more work in order to get to something that's [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1907.32s)]
*  commercially meaningful. And with some of the other programs that we had moving forward, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1915.24s)]
*  as I mentioned, the HPV and CLEI program, we just thought they had a higher probability of success. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1921.6399999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, as a small biotech company, getting to know quickly is a good thing. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1927.72s)]
*  And so, instead of throwing bad money after good, or good money after bad, however the saying goes, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1936.76s)]
*  you know, you can focus. And so that's what we decided to do is really focus our efforts. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1945.32s)]
*  And unfortunately, as a result of that, you also have to focus your team. And that led to some [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1952.12s)]
*  redundancies, some reduction in workforce, depending on which side of the pond you're on, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1961.08s)]
*  how that's termed. Yeah. So at the first sort of the initial decision point around, you know, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1967.6399999999999s)]
*  indication and where you're going to focus, talk to us a little bit about the, you know, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1975.8s)]
*  in your role as CEO, the balance between commercial opportunity and data. Because it occurs to me, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1981.24s)]
*  you know, earlier you talked about like, you know, when coronavirus first reared its head, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1987.16s)]
*  and there was some pressure on you to go chase that shiny object. And you're like, yeah, you know [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1992.0400000000002s)]
*  what, history tells me that there's not a commercial opportunity with these pandemics. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=1997.3200000000002s)]
*  You're commercially minded, obviously. That's a good thing. That's a good thing for a biotech CEO. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2003.64s)]
*  HPV, I can't spew to you the analyst reports and market opportunities [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2009.0s)]
*  around hepatitis, HPV, and celiac and where there's the most money to be made. But I do know that HPV [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2016.52s)]
*  is not, it's not in terms of market opportunity. It's nothing to sneeze at, right? HPV is a big... [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2023.72s)]
*  No, no, absolutely. It's a huge opportunity. I mean, a significant number of women every year, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2029.48s)]
*  up to a million women that have, you know, cervical cancer as a result of HPV. So it's a large, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2037.6399999999999s)]
*  unmet medical need. And, you know, the product that we have still could be developed for it. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2045.08s)]
*  I do think there's still potential there. I just think there's higher potential elsewhere. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2056.84s)]
*  And that's where we really had to make the choice. You know, we've got a limited amount of money. And [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2061.48s)]
*  you know, given current market conditions, it forces you to prioritize. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2068.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So what were some of the, I guess, so data, data was the driver that said, you know, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2073.1600000000003s)]
*  we're going after HPV and celiac. Yep. So again, we already had interim data in HPV, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2080.36s)]
*  which again, we believe is best in class. And so that combined with the fact that the [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2089.4s)]
*  celiac program, the immune tolerance space right now is pretty hot. There's a lot of activity [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2099.88s)]
*  going on. There's a lot of interest from investors. There's a lot of interest from [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2106.44s)]
*  strategic partners and a lot of unmet medical need in that area as well. And we've got a very [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2110.8399999999997s)]
*  differentiated platform that really goes after a different mechanism of action than many people [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2117.88s)]
*  that are in that space. And so we're trying to rebalance the immune system where many people [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2126.04s)]
*  are trying to sensitize. And so we think this is really well differentiated and the platform is [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2133.32s)]
*  applicable not only to celiac, which is kind of a proof of principle for us, because this platform [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2145.96s)]
*  hasn't yet been in people, but you know, in some much larger indications like type one diabetes and [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2152.28s)]
*  rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. You know, these are all immune tolerance diseases where [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2159.08s)]
*  we believe the same mechanism of action will be important. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2165.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. Celiac is one of those things that for a long time, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2170.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, catch me up. I'm not familiar with where that is from a clinical [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2177.64s)]
*  sort of physician level perspective right now. But I know for a long time it was a pretty [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2182.12s)]
*  misunderstood condition. It was often difficult or altogether misdiagnosed. Have we gotten to the [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2187.0s)]
*  point now where at the clinical level, at the physician level, there's a good enough understanding [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2196.04s)]
*  and a solid enough base of understanding to say, okay, like, you know, we know these patients and [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2203.96s)]
*  we know that, you know. Yeah, it has gotten to that point, you know, and it's a significant [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2208.6s)]
*  number of patients, right? It's about 1% of the world population and growing at about 7.5% a year. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2214.92s)]
*  So it's a rapidly growing problem. It does get confused with people who are gluten intolerant [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2221.64s)]
*  and have other issues or feel better when they don't eat gluten. And so, you know, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2229.48s)]
*  some of that gets mixed in. But, you know, ultimately for a celiac patient, you end up [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2234.3599999999997s)]
*  with an intolerance to gluten, which manifests itself in the intestine where the lining of the [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2241.72s)]
*  intestine is not normal. And so you can do biopsies to show that. And, you know, hopefully [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2249.48s)]
*  after treatment, you can do biopsies to show that you're seeing some repair in the intestinal cell [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2259.08s)]
*  lining, in the epithelial cells. And so, you know, you need to be careful in how you do your trials [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2264.68s)]
*  and that you're actually getting real celiac patients and those kind of things because, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2272.6s)]
*  it does get conflated with other things. But it is a real issue. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2278.44s)]
*  Yeah, very good. So give us sort of a go forward perspective on those two programs, at least, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2284.6s)]
*  HBV and celiac. Where are you now and what are the next steps? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2291.88s)]
*  So we've got two ongoing phase two clinical trials in HBV. And one we're doing ourselves and one is a [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2296.8399999999997s)]
*  collaboration that we're doing with a company called Arbutus. And we've shown really promising [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2305.4s)]
*  data from both of those studies. And so we've got additional interim data readouts from those [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2312.6800000000003s)]
*  programs later this year, in the fourth quarter of this year, probably around another major liver [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2322.2000000000003s)]
*  conference called AASLD in November. And then that hopefully we'll be able to use those data [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2329.64s)]
*  to nail down the final regimen so that we can go into a phase two slash three study for registration. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2339.64s)]
*  That's the goal from these programs moving forward. And then on the celiac program, as I said, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2348.68s)]
*  that's much earlier, so hasn't quite hit the clinic yet. We're on the cusp. And so [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2355.32s)]
*  that's a little bit longer. But celiac is an interesting one. So the phase one study [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2362.04s)]
*  that we have moving forward, we can get some limited efficacy data even from the phase one [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2369.88s)]
*  study because you can do challenge studies. You can treat people and then give them gluten [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2376.76s)]
*  to see how they react. And so you can get an efficacy readout pretty quickly in those kind [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2383.48s)]
*  of trials. And that'll really allow us to shape the development path moving forward, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2390.04s)]
*  looking at whether or not we're going to need repeat dosing and how long that interval should [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2399.16s)]
*  be between repeat dosing and those kinds of things that we'll have to determine in order to advance [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2405.72s)]
*  that product. Yeah, that's a big benefit. Is there a pretty stout competitive space in celiac? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2412.04s)]
*  There's a couple of companies that are in that space. One is probably about the same [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2420.52s)]
*  stage we are. One is a little bit ahead of us, but a very different approach. And one of the issues [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2428.04s)]
*  is the companies that are out there now all have to deliver their drugs IV, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2435.0s)]
*  where we're able to do it intramuscular. So we can give them a shot from an administration [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2442.68s)]
*  perspective. And that really simplifies with the clinical trials and the potential commercial [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2450.68s)]
*  opportunity as well. Sure. Yeah, definitely a patient forward approach. Yeah. So we're running [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2457.0s)]
*  short on time here, Bill. And, you know, my next question for you was going to be what's next for [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2464.44s)]
*  Bill Enright. But I don't want you to answer that because I'm going to answer it for you. I, through [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2470.12s)]
*  the course of this conversation, have come to the conclusion that I want you to stay at Barentas [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2474.68s)]
*  for quite some time, because it occurs to me that when you make major shifts in your career, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2480.2000000000003s)]
*  when you take new jobs, bad things are happening all around us. For the good of humanity, Bill, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2487.0s)]
*  stick with Barentas for a while. We don't need another recession, epidemic, depression, any of [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2495.16s)]
*  the above. I'm with you. Yeah. The timing of some of these changes has not been great. You know, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2501.2400000000002s)]
*  we got Barentas public and right at the end of that window. And, you know, the last couple of [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2508.44s)]
*  years have been pretty difficult from a funding perspective. But thankfully, you know, we did a [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2515.2400000000002s)]
*  pretty large series B and then followed that on with the IPO and put ourselves in a good position [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2523.0s)]
*  to weather the storm. And, you know, that's where we are. We've got cash into the second quarter of [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2528.6s)]
*  2026. So we're still in fairly good shape from that perspective. And we're excited about where [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2537.4s)]
*  we are and what we've got coming up. And, you know, I would encourage everyone to look at the stock [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2543.24s)]
*  carefully because I think we're significantly undervalued opportunity. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2551.88s)]
*  I mean, 2025 is going to bring you some opportunities to, you know, for sure. It sounds [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2558.12s)]
*  like the clinical path you're on. There's going to be some things happening in 2025 that creates [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2564.92s)]
*  some value for Barentas. So I thank you for coming on. I encourage you to keep up the great work. As [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2569.56s)]
*  I said, I encourage you to stay at Barentas. If you're going to leave, give me a heads up. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2575.8s)]
*  Let me know. Move all your money to cash for a while. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2580.28s)]
*  Call it insider trading. No, but I appreciate you coming on the show, Bill. It's been a pleasure. And [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2585.0800000000004s)]
*  the next time you're in Buffalo, let's do wings and a few beers. Awesome. I look forward to it. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2591.5600000000004s)]
*  Me too. So that's Barentas Therapeutics CEO Bill Enright. I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business of [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2599.6400000000003s)]
*  Biotech, a Life Science Connect podcast that's closely aligned with Bioprocess Online. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2606.28s)]
*  Bioprocess Online has a live free virtual event coming up on December 3rd, featuring our own Tyler [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2611.96s)]
*  Menichello, BMS Executive Director for Cell Therapies, Dr. Steven Krauss, and some more [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2618.76s)]
*  friends discussing analytical methods transfer strategy and more specifically how to develop [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2624.6800000000003s)]
*  analytical methods that are purpose built for transfer. In the meantime, keep us dialed up [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3aEfsCZi4&t=2630.12s)]
