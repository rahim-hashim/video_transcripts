*  and Innovator in the RNA Interference, or RNAi, Therapeutic Space. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=58.0s)]
*  Tolga is a commercial leader with deep industry experience who has helped commercialize some blockbuster brands you may have heard of, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=64.0s)]
*  such as Viagra and Eloquus. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=71.0s)]
*  He also led Pfizer's Rare Disease Group for North America before joining Alexion Pharmaceuticals [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=74.0s)]
*  as Senior Vice President and head of Alexion's U.S. organization. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=80.0s)]
*  Tolga joined Alnylum in 2020 and has been a key player in expanding the company's footprint globally to more than 60 markets [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=84.0s)]
*  and dramatically increasing patient access to Alnylum's therapies. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=92.0s)]
*  Thanks for being here today, Tolga. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=97.0s)]
*  Great to see you, Ben. Thank you for having me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=99.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I wanted to start with how you got into this line of work. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=102.0s)]
*  What attracted you initially to pharmaceutical drug marketing and commercialization? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=107.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank you, Ben. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=113.0s)]
*  And I wish I could tell you that there was this great, great grand plan for me to join the industry. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=114.0s)]
*  But it came a bit of, I think, a happenstance, and I feel very fortunate to be part of the industry looking back after 25, 30 years. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=119.0s)]
*  Essentially, my family is a good mix of a business executive and my mom is a psychologist who has been in the medical industry. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=130.0s)]
*  So medicine was not a new territory for me. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=144.0s)]
*  While I was at business school, I had a number of offers, one of which was actually an offer from Merck that was part of the leadership development program. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=149.0s)]
*  Which really fit very nicely with something that my father always used to say, which is if you want to do something and if you want to lead something, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=159.0s)]
*  learn from the bottom and understand how actually the sausage is being made. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=167.0s)]
*  So Merck leadership program was actually a great opportunity, and that's why I actually picked it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=172.0s)]
*  And of course, again, science, medicine, technology weren't areas that were too unfamiliar for me. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=177.0s)]
*  So that was actually a great start. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=183.0s)]
*  And again, I've been very fortunate being associated with great companies like Pfizer, Merck in the beginning, Pfizer throughout my formative career. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=186.0s)]
*  And then, as you mentioned, I had the opportunity to join the biotech world first with Alexion and now last four or five years with Alnylam, which has been just a phenomenal ride. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah, you went from from gigantic drugs to rare drugs. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=209.0s)]
*  And now, you know, Alnylam might be heading back. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=214.0s)]
*  The pendulum may be swinging back back towards some larger patient audiences. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=217.0s)]
*  I have to ask you about working on Viagra. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=222.0s)]
*  What was that experience like? Was that the first big brand that you worked on? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=225.0s)]
*  It was. And frankly, what's really interesting, I was given an opportunity to work either with Celebrex or Viagra. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=229.0s)]
*  And I made the decision early on that I would actually work on Viagra. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=237.0s)]
*  A, what an iconic brand and who wouldn't like to kind of learn and understand how an iconic brand works. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=241.0s)]
*  And the second piece of it was unlike most of our medicines in those erectile dysfunction category, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=249.0s)]
*  doctors tend to advocate the sort of writing these products to their patients. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=257.0s)]
*  So I felt like I'm going to work with science and I'm going to work with these very unique therapies throughout my career. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=263.0s)]
*  But Viagra will probably come once in a lifetime where you actually get to understand how patients think through. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=271.0s)]
*  And it's obviously in those days, especially it was a stigmatic category and working in a stigmatic disease area and working with the patients. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=277.0s)]
*  And the patients was very intriguing to me. And frankly, I never looked back after the experience. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=289.0s)]
*  It really allowed me to understand how patients think and how to actually help patients with a condition that is so stigmatic. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. In the late 90s, I was working in a mom and pop pharmacy, is actually a compounding pharmacy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=304.0s)]
*  And I remember the Viagra sales team coming in, which maybe you can answer this question for me before I tell this short story, I promise. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=313.0s)]
*  I want to talk more on biotech, but yes, let's talk about. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=322.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Just for just for a second. Bear with me here. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=325.0s)]
*  I was always curious about why the sales detail team came into a pharmacy given that, you know, the pharmacists weren't writing prescriptions. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=328.0s)]
*  Can you clear that up for me? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=336.0s)]
*  Yes, yes, actually. In fact, when I was a year when I started my rotation program at Merck, I spent in the field a year and we were asked to go into these pharmacies. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=338.0s)]
*  It was mainly because you wanted to understand how the pharmacists reacting to the patient needs and also understand if they see any demand. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=350.0s)]
*  So we would actually just talk. It was always a bit of an optional call in those days. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=360.0s)]
*  I don't think we do that anymore as an industry. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=365.0s)]
*  And you have, you know, ability to to capture a lot of data and insights through third party without going to these pharmacies. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=368.0s)]
*  But it was actually beautiful. And this is started in the 90s. You're spot on. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=375.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, what I remember from the sales detail folks that came through was a Viagra calculator that you may remember this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=379.0s)]
*  It was flat and you pushed a button on it and the top kind of rotated around and then ultimately stood the calculator up a little bit, which we were, you know, as a high school male, I was very, very tickled by. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=388.0s)]
*  But anyway, well, listen, those are some of the practices that I'm so glad that the industry moved away from. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=400.0s)]
*  Well, I was going to use that as a segue to ask you, you know, how launching and commercializing new therapies has changed since you worked on Viagra in the early aughts. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=406.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, like everything, the industry had some growing up to do. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=417.0s)]
*  And I think we did. And obviously the diseases that I'm so keen on on commercializing, which is simply a word meaning, how do we get this product into the hands of the patients? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=422.0s)]
*  And how do we actually generate value? And how do we then bring that value back to our companies that continue to innovate for transformative diseases that patients that need the most? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=437.0s)]
*  So that's been my passion. And that's how we've evolved. And what I really like about the space that we're in has a lot to do with the words that I just used, which is higher medical needs. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=451.0s)]
*  And prevent medical needs and transformative therapies and society right now in the right way, start valuing and rewarding those actually products that truly make a difference so that you know, you don't get to work on spend a lot of human and and and capital to areas where [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=466.0s)]
*  And that's not where you generate value. And let me tell you also another personal story about why I'm so keen on actually working on those products is a lot to do with with my son and his journey. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=487.0s)]
*  In about a middle of my career, this is just before I start leading the rare disease unit in North America for Pfizer. My son was diagnosed with leukemia, childhood leukemia. He was 11 years of age. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=504.0s)]
*  And even though you know, I was in the middle of my career in the in the pharmaceutical biotech industry, and I always thought I was very patient focused and I always cared about the impact that our medicines or potential medicines will make on people. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=521.0s)]
*  But boy, when that hits you in your family in a very personal way, you start looking at things very differently. And and and frankly, that was one of the reasons why I was attracted to to rare because you knew that the impact that individual impact you can make is really profound on a single life. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=539.0s)]
*  And now, obviously, with the the terapia is that we're working on our line them for the future is what really excites me is you can actually make those profound impact in a much broader population. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=560.0s)]
*  And what's so great about our line them is and I guess we'll get into this is, is the technology platform that we have that enables us to do, whether it's a single genetic mutation condition or a protein that may actually impact a significant illness like hypertension or hypercholesterolemia. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=573.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, thanks for sharing that story. Did your son survive? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=593.0s)]
*  He did. I should have said that. Yes, he's a annoying 20 year old college student. He's doing great. And then we all recognize that none of those things are for granted. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=597.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm happy to hear that. I wanted. Yeah. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=608.0s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, let me add this. He wouldn't have survived if it wasn't for our industry and science, because only 50 years ago, this was a death sentence. Now the prognosis rates are as good as 90 percent. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=614.0s)]
*  So that's the progress that we need to continue to make because there are a lot of kids out there. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=628.0s)]
*  There are a lot of adults out there whose whose illnesses are not transformed yet. But we were very lucky that we got into that bucket of diseases that science and medicine have figured out a way to solve it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=633.0s)]
*  What would you say is is different about launching and commercializing an RNAI drug versus other more established drug modalities? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=650.0s)]
*  And I'm thinking, you know, we we had a short call just to prepare for this podcast, Tolga. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=660.0s)]
*  And, you know, one of the things that that came up was this kind of, you know, I don't know if I want to call it inertia, but a comfort level or a resistance to change that you might sometimes encounter with with prescribers. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=666.0s)]
*  And I'm I'm curious, I guess first, you know, what's different, what you know, what you would say about what's different about commercializing, launching an RNA RNAI drug, but also how you bring such a new modality to physicians and overcome, you know, some of those kinds of resistance to change that they might present. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=679.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So, I mean, listen, I find it, to be honest, as an opportunity. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=700.0s)]
*  I think we talked about eloquence and how, you know, at the time we had head to head data both on on on the primary endpoints like, you know, stroke prevention and risk reduction and safety versus cumulative, which is a 50 year old product that's been out there to for blood thinners for blood thinning. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=707.0s)]
*  And essentially, even though you had a head to head trial that showed superiority versus cumitin in both on primary endpoints, as well as on safety, doctors were not willing to make the change. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=731.0s)]
*  They all felt like, you know, they were able to control the patient's bleeding, which was not an easy dosing. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=745.0s)]
*  And then you had to get liver enzyme tests and everything. And that took us a while. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=752.0s)]
*  So there is, I guess, an inherent condition in all of us and also with doctors to be a little skeptical about new treatment options. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=757.0s)]
*  What's so great about, I think, what our nylon provides and allows us to rethink is, is the fact that you can literally do a subcutaneous injection every three months to, you know, lessen the the the hypercholesterolemia. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=766.0s)]
*  You know, one of our products is is right now being marketed by Novartis. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=786.0s)]
*  It's so the product named Lekvia. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=791.0s)]
*  So that is, you know, I see that the numbers are picking up that that is exactly the example where how doctors tend to tend to resist. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=794.0s)]
*  Now, I find that it really also gives us an opportunity to completely rethink how medicine is practiced. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=803.0s)]
*  We're currently working on a product called Xyblisiran that is subcutaneous in the injection every six months that lowers potentially lowers systolic blood pressure. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=810.0s)]
*  Now, we have several highly effective medicines that are out there that lowers lowers blood pressure and they are inexpensive. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=822.0s)]
*  Yet for any account, there is about 20 million Americans that suffer uncontrolled blood pressure that results in stroke and other significant consequences of blood pressure. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=833.0s)]
*  So why is that? Well, one of the answers is actually probably patients are not taking their medicines every day. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=845.0s)]
*  Once a day pill or twice a day pill is sound as simple as it is. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=854.0s)]
*  Now I'm that age where I'm taking some of those medicines. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=859.0s)]
*  I can tell you I miss them and I know what the consequences are. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=862.0s)]
*  So bringing a medicine that is highly effective and safe and with a simple subcutaneous injection that you visit your doctor or a nurse comes in your home and injects you opens up a whole set of opportunities. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=866.0s)]
*  And that really excites me because commercializing a new technology in that respect is really, really, I think, advantageous. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=882.0s)]
*  But it's going to require us to also challenge ourselves to see how we actually bring some of those opportunities in mind. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=890.0s)]
*  Now, the other plus I think that we have that maybe amazing gene therapies, therapy options are actually struggling is we were not one and done. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=898.0s)]
*  You know, we're not actually required to change how we get reimbursed. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=911.0s)]
*  Actually, we fit nicely into the reimbursement structure that is currently set for medicines that are taken regularly. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=917.0s)]
*  We don't need to actually price our disease as one and done, which actually gives us some advantages to actually work within the existing reimbursement system. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=927.0s)]
*  And those are I would say actually it's not going to require us to change. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=937.0s)]
*  But at the same time, these treatment regiments that are actually infrequent and simple with a subcutaneous injection may give us a sort of opportunity to to force the health care system to rethink how medicine is practiced. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=942.0s)]
*  You know, that brings to mind for me a key commercial issue that I wonder if, you know, I'm sure some of our listeners for the business of biotech will know about this. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=960.0s)]
*  Others may not, though, which is the gross to net issue. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=972.0s)]
*  And I noticed in Allen Island's fourth quarter in twenty twenty four earnings report that there were some positive gross to net adjustments made in the U.S. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=976.0s)]
*  During the fourth quarter. And I wonder, Tolga, would you mind just giving a brief, very high level explanation of what gross to net is? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=987.0s)]
*  Yeah, essentially, it's the the your your products, revenue minus, you know, minus essentially your royalties and rebates and and and cost of goods. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=997.0s)]
*  So that's how, you know, gross net is adjusted. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1012.0s)]
*  And look, I mean, I think it's a it's a question of for a company that is destined to to change how medicine is practiced. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1015.0s)]
*  We need to continue to force ourselves and our organization how our our cost of goods is actually continue to be brought down. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1027.0s)]
*  And this is an area where obviously we are we're not a biologic. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1038.0s)]
*  We're also not a small molecule. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1043.0s)]
*  Our, you know, our manufacturing is is complex and it's not cheap. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1045.0s)]
*  But we certainly believe unlike a gene therapy cost or even a biologic cost, we have an opportunity to actually to continue to further reduce costs. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1052.0s)]
*  Our our CEO, Yvonne, has this vision of democratizing RNA, meaning try to manufacture it as as as inexpensively as possible so we can actually make it available, not just in the U.S., but in other markets where cost is even a more bigger sensitivity. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1062.0s)]
*  And we're we're trying to we're trying to obviously make that happen. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1079.0s)]
*  Now, specific to the Q4 results, there's always going to be ins and outs how those rebates are actualized. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1084.0s)]
*  There's some also timing of some of those, you know, rebates, how they're actually being recognized. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1092.0s)]
*  So I wouldn't necessarily too much pay too much attention to sort of quarterly changes. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1099.0s)]
*  What's really helpful is to look at the annual metrics and those obviously metrics will also continue to evolve. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1106.0s)]
*  Right. And just for the benefit of our listeners, gross to net gross, obviously meaning what the product is sold for net is what you're actually making on the product. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1114.0s)]
*  And a lot of times the criticism of this so-called gross to net bubble has to do with rebates. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1123.0s)]
*  And now, Tolga, you're reducing the cost of goods. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1130.0s)]
*  So that's that's an excellent way to improve gross to net. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1133.0s)]
*  And, you know, similarly fixing the compliance issue, which, you know, I've been a journalist covering biopharmaceuticals for close to 15 years. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1137.0s)]
*  And for a while there, it seemed like once a year, I'd write the adherence and compliance article and somebody had a new idea about how to improve it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1146.0s)]
*  It never improved. You know, we still it's an ongoing challenge. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1154.0s)]
*  But, you know, when you have a shot that you can give over a course of months, you're you're taking yourself out of that compliance quandary. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1158.0s)]
*  Similarly, you know, with with lowering the cost of goods, you're you know, you're you're setting yourself up for success in gross to net, at least in terms of things you can manage. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1167.0s)]
*  Well, you're you're spot on, Ben, because I mean, look, just like you over the years when I worked on, especially on tablets, both the industry as well as like pharmacists. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1178.0s)]
*  I've seen pharmacists actually have these devices that every time you open the pill tab, it would actually send a message whether you're compliant or not. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1191.0s)]
*  So the whole industry has been working around this issue around tablets. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1200.0s)]
*  And we haven't found anything because I think inherently taking a pill every day or twice a day is not a normal human condition. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1204.0s)]
*  Now, again, there are people who are incredibly adherent. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1214.0s)]
*  But even in oncology, we see adherence rates as low as 70 percent. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1217.0s)]
*  I mean, this is cancer in more, you know, sort of metabolic diseases. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1221.0s)]
*  We see rates at 60 percent, 70 percent. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1229.0s)]
*  So if we can actually solve this by simply how patients take their medicine every three months, every six months in physician office or nurse practitioner visiting your home, I think we will go a long way. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1232.0s)]
*  And I don't think we actually we can overestimate the human health impact that's going to be made on the patients. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1246.0s)]
*  And if you look at our current products, our adherence rates are 90, 95 percent, every category that we work on. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1254.0s)]
*  So there's something obviously to be said about how our medicines are administered. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1261.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the other thing about a daily tablet and compliance to me is, you know, particularly maybe in disease areas like cholesterol or even diabetes. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1268.0s)]
*  I think one of the major challenges is that if you miss a dose, nothing really happens. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1279.0s)]
*  There's no, you know, there's no consequence right away from from missing a dose. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1284.0s)]
*  It's a calm. It's you know, it's a it's taking it over a period of time and missing doses. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1289.0s)]
*  And so when you when you don't, you know, you're not automatically feeling better because you took your cholesterol medicine on a given day. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1295.0s)]
*  It makes it difficult to really incentivize your spot on any as an industry. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1302.0s)]
*  I think we face two major hurdles. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1307.0s)]
*  One is the physician complacency, because if you can do this yourself or those colleagues that are watching this should do that. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1309.0s)]
*  If you ask any doctor in any therapy area whether their patients are actually adherent or compliant, they'll say yes. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1320.0s)]
*  Of course. Right. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1330.0s)]
*  So there is that, I think, issue. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1332.0s)]
*  And then to your point, patients. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1334.0s)]
*  Yeah, I find miss my statin or hypertension. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1337.0s)]
*  But again, I'm giving you some numbers, even in cancer, where patients actually don't take their medicine or maybe they need a caregiver that needs to do that. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1339.0s)]
*  And they don't have the socioeconomic, you know, set up to be able to do that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1349.0s)]
*  And we see it part of mostly on pediatric patients. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1353.0s)]
*  And if the caregiver is, you know, less educated or a single parent that's working, those compliance rates tend to go down. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1358.0s)]
*  So this is an area where I think we need to continue to work as an industry. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1367.0s)]
*  And one solution is obviously come up with better medicines that are taken less frequently. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1371.0s)]
*  I mentioned that in the intro, Tolga, about Alnylam's global expansion, almost half of the company's revenues now are coming from ex-US markets. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1377.0s)]
*  What can you say about the strategy that Alnylam followed to accomplish this? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1388.0s)]
*  And, you know, what are some of the biggest challenges in building a large and growing global footprint? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1395.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, first and foremost, I don't think I can take the full credit of the Alnylam expansion strategy because those actually who founded the company always had this really bold vision. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1402.0s)]
*  And frankly, since I've arrived in four or five years ago, what I've been able to do is to actually embolden that strategy even further. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1415.0s)]
*  Now, to your point, we do generate about 40, 45 percent of our revenue. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1426.0s)]
*  We continue to grow in terms of volume about the same rate that you would see in the US. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1432.0s)]
*  And frankly, it's mainly driven by how I believe we're approaching our expansion. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1438.0s)]
*  And for a small biotech, I think we're punching way above our weight. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1447.0s)]
*  And I don't think we ever look back about having that international presence. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1451.0s)]
*  But we do it very thoughtfully and very carefully because actually it can put a strain on your resources, having that geographic footprint. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1455.0s)]
*  But the potential benefit of investing a little bit on your ex-US markets actually happens that you actually balance your revenue flow. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1463.0s)]
*  So that's actually a big plus. You start finding opportunities where there might be some endemic regions that are less in the US. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1476.0s)]
*  We certainly see that in our ultra rare disease area. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1483.0s)]
*  And as you grow, you don't need to leave a lot of value on the table for a third party or distributor that actually ends up actually really commercializing your product, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1488.0s)]
*  where you get to keep that value again to transfer it into your research and development. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1499.0s)]
*  So with that outlook, what we did is we started looking at the globe, not just geographically, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1503.0s)]
*  but actually we looked at it from an archetype, market archetype perspective. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1512.0s)]
*  And what I mean by that is if I look at geographies like Europe, there are actually many, many archetypes within that European geographies. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1516.0s)]
*  You have developed markets like UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, where there is value that's being generated by good reimbursement system, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1527.0s)]
*  good health care system where you have access to new innovative therapies. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1537.0s)]
*  But you also have markets where, I don't know, Turkey, Greece, Eastern European markets where access to medicine is less likely [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1542.0s)]
*  and where you don't want to probably spend a lot of time and energy in commercializing and have someone else do it because the juice is not simply enough, the squeeze. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1551.0s)]
*  Now, when I look at Southeast Asia, I see more similar markets like the ones that I just described with you, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1563.0s)]
*  like the distributor markets like Vietnam and Korea and Singapore, where you actually, again, you may want to go to a distributor and not have your own direct footprint. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1570.0s)]
*  But then you have Japan that actually very similar markets like Germany and UK and Spain. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1582.0s)]
*  So what we did is we said, let's look at the market archetypes. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1590.0s)]
*  Let's combine those markets that are similar under one roof. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1593.0s)]
*  And that's our international market that actually goes, spans through Canada all the way to Japan, including all major European markets. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1598.0s)]
*  And then when it comes to those distributor markets and we call them affectionately our partner in emerging markets, let's consolidate with few. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1607.0s)]
*  So instead of having worked with like 10, 12 different distributors, let's keep them, consolidate them into few, two or three of them. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1617.0s)]
*  So we can actually expand through them. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1626.0s)]
*  That actually helps us to actually minimize disruption and deepens our relationships. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1628.0s)]
*  And by the way, it allows us to make make them more compliant. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1634.0s)]
*  So we actually have these partner in emerging markets that we work with few of them and we expand through them. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1639.0s)]
*  And then we obviously treat our US as our single most important markets. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1645.0s)]
*  And then the rest of the world, we call them partner in emerging markets. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1650.0s)]
*  Now, the other category we have is our global rare business units. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1654.0s)]
*  So unlike unlike our TTR franchise where we really focus on market by market opportunity, our ultra rare market, we actually consolidate our expense basis in a very small footprint. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1659.0s)]
*  And our global rare franchise operates as an end to end business unit. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1674.0s)]
*  And that actually gives us a lot of efficiencies and also allows us to focus on not all markets in ultra rare are equal. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1679.0s)]
*  So, you know, our global rarity may be focused more on Middle East markets where we see endemic on hyperoxidemia, but then we don't go and maybe work too deeply on France, for instance, because the opportunity may not be as big as some of the markets in the Middle East. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1688.0s)]
*  Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1707.0s)]
*  I'm curious about what factors you consider when you're deciding whether or not to partner with a distributor or, you know, go as Al Nailam. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1709.0s)]
*  What you know, what are what are how do you make that call? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1719.0s)]
*  That's a that's a great question. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1722.0s)]
*  First of all, it's a very nuanced call and there's no one single playbook. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1724.0s)]
*  But what we look at, of course, the longevity and the growth trajectory of the particular category for any particular time point, we say, look, do we have the resources right now? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1729.0s)]
*  Because we're just about to become profitable this year, right? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1742.0s)]
*  That's what we declared. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1745.0s)]
*  So we still need to look at our sales and administrative costs. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1746.0s)]
*  We look at then the complexity of the markets. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1751.0s)]
*  Are we going to be able to actually build the regulatory muscles that we need to have? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1756.0s)]
*  And again, if the longevity, the sustainability of that growth is worthwhile, then we go after it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1761.0s)]
*  I'll give you one example. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1768.0s)]
*  Actually, it's interestingly, originally Australia was a market where we said it's part of this sort of archetype where needs to be under our international market because you have social and economic markets. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1769.0s)]
*  You have socialized medicine. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1780.0s)]
*  You have access to to to to, you know, patients and it's reimbursed. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1782.0s)]
*  So we said, let's go and work and have our footprint. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1790.0s)]
*  Then are actually our partner in the emerging markets leader gave us a challenge. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1793.0s)]
*  He said, I can actually make this product available faster and I can actually do it with a lower cost base. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1799.0s)]
*  So both teams got together and actually we ran a business simulation and we ended up actually saying, you know what, for now, let's actually go and distribute this market with a trusted partner that we already knew. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1805.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1818.0s)]
*  They beat those timelines and we actually made one of our products available already in Australia much faster than we would ever imagine if we were to go there faster. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1819.0s)]
*  So as I'm explaining, there is no real one single playbook. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1829.0s)]
*  There are principles that we look into and then we make the decision accordingly. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1834.0s)]
*  That's really interesting. Who is the who is the partner in Australia? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1839.0s)]
*  It's a company called Medicine, which we actually partner with multiple markets. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1843.0s)]
*  Great. What what role Tolga does pricing play in mapping out market entrance strategy globally? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1851.0s)]
*  I mean, do you think about country sequencing and price? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1859.0s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1863.0s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, I mean, of course, to your point, it's a bit of an industry standard to make sure that we actually really understand and appreciate cross border impact of how it's priced. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1865.0s)]
*  And also, if we were to, you know, if we were to sort of, you know, deal be dealing with reference pricing back and so forth. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1878.0s)]
*  But I think what's really exciting about on Lyle and again, this is an area where I like to think that we've been punching above our weight is before we even commercialized our first product, we came up with a patient access philosophy. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1887.0s)]
*  And that patient access philosophy has been actually sort of the guiding light for us. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1902.0s)]
*  We're never going to increase our price above inflation. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1906.0s)]
*  And if you look at our pricing over the years, now we have been commercializing products for the last five, six years. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1911.0s)]
*  We made very few price increases, if that ever. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1918.0s)]
*  And that's always been under inflation. So that's that's been number one. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1922.0s)]
*  Number two is we play to our strength of our of our science and our platform technology. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1925.0s)]
*  We only promote and make our products available that are transformative as medicines. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1934.0s)]
*  So we always keen on what's the value to the society. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1940.0s)]
*  How am I going to actually sort of interpret that for the payer? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1945.0s)]
*  And then the last but not least, what's the patient affordability is going to be? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1952.0s)]
*  So it's one thing to put your this price and your point in the US. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1955.0s)]
*  We also have this rebates that we need to work with. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1959.0s)]
*  It's an imperfect system. We don't like it. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1963.0s)]
*  But that's the system that we're currently working on. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1965.0s)]
*  And then it becomes this question about what's the impact on the patients? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1970.0s)]
*  What is the patient going to actually have to pay the copay? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1975.0s)]
*  Are there programs that we can make that happen? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1978.0s)]
*  Are there things that we can work with the payers? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1982.0s)]
*  We have been pioneering value based agreements. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1986.0s)]
*  Now, those value based agreements are are essentially about really putting your money where your mouth is. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1989.0s)]
*  So if I'm negotiating with a payer and saying, look, we believe the patients will stay on therapy [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=1997.0s)]
*  and they're not going to have to deal with the consequences of the disease, albeit maybe already. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2003.0s)]
*  Transplant or or or patient if they stay on therapy, they're not going to be hospitalized. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2007.0s)]
*  This depending on the label, depending on the agreements, I can't disclose a lot of those. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2013.0s)]
*  But what I can tell you is we're not covering about 60 percent of those patients that are under [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2018.0s)]
*  covered under commercial or Medicare advantage through these value based agreements, roughly about 55 percent, 55 of those. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2024.0s)]
*  So those really actually help us. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2032.0s)]
*  So it's not just the cost or the price. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2034.0s)]
*  It's how do you actually build the ecosystem around that that enables us to actually go in and provide the value narrative around around the around the payers? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2037.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get into this value based contracts topic a little bit. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2047.0s)]
*  It's something I I probably first wrote about this idea of value based contracts, I don't know, 10 or 12 years ago. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2053.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's kind of gone up and down in terms of interest and popularity and value based contracts. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2060.0s)]
*  I think it's like so many things. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2067.0s)]
*  There was great excitement at the beginning and then some kind of reality seeped in where people found out it's you know, it's not so easy always to manage these kinds of contracts, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2069.0s)]
*  assess them across or agreed upon points and, you know, the the lifestyle, lifecycle of the medicine or even in the patient's health. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2080.0s)]
*  Could you would it be possible, Tolga, to give us an example or two of a value based contract that Alnylam is involved with? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2090.0s)]
*  Some sort of from soup to nuts explain, you know, what products involved, how it works, how you assess it, how it's managed. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2098.0s)]
*  Right. So just upfront, you know, I'll be able to give you some flavor, but not all the all the specifics. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2106.0s)]
*  But I'm sure it's going to be helpful for your audience. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2113.0s)]
*  But look, I mean, let's let's also take the first point you just made. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2116.0s)]
*  You have to stick with it, right? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2122.0s)]
*  So one of the great, I think, skills or the values that we have is Alnylam is being very resilient. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2124.0s)]
*  So when RNAI was in favor, we were there and RNAI wasn't in favor. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2134.0s)]
*  A lot of these big pharma companies pulled out. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2139.0s)]
*  We were still there. And value based agreement is a bit like that, too. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2142.0s)]
*  If you believe in the in the theory and if you believe in the practice, working with some some partners in the long term, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2146.0s)]
*  it actually adds gives you credibility. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2156.0s)]
*  You also learn from each other and you start building this as a real capability. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2159.0s)]
*  So you can't just treat this as a flavor of the month. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2164.0s)]
*  And because of that, I think I can kind of safely talk to you about some of the programs we have. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2169.0s)]
*  So let's say so you want me to be a little specific. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2174.0s)]
*  So let me give you a few examples, one of which is in ultra rare. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2177.0s)]
*  So in ultra rare, what you usually see is especially in the United States, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2182.0s)]
*  per treatment cost tends to be higher than your other other treatments. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2189.0s)]
*  And therefore, payers avoid. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2195.0s)]
*  You sort of end up with these with these with these patients. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2199.0s)]
*  But if you're around there and if you're covering many lives, you're going to end up with some patients. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2203.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, frankly, not all these rare conditions, a very small percentage of these rare conditions are actually now diagnosed and treated. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2210.0s)]
*  But when you get them, what you worry is how am I going to manage this cost inflation? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2219.0s)]
*  And is this going to be going to be impacting my level of predictability? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2227.0s)]
*  And as you know, insurers care about the cost, but they care more about predictability. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2231.0s)]
*  So one of the things we did with the value based agreements is we said, look, according to everything that we see and the prevalence numbers that we see in ultra rare, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2238.0s)]
*  we're going to cap some of the the costs if a number goes way above what that prevalence ratio should show based on all the population and epidemiology data that we have. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2247.0s)]
*  So you're giving them some predictability. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2262.0s)]
*  Exactly. So that's one angle. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2265.0s)]
*  Another angle that we do with our TTR franchise is we look at clinical outcomes. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2268.0s)]
*  We say, look, according to this, here's how the patient should behave. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2273.0s)]
*  And if you don't, then we're actually willing to provide you a certain rebate or a discount or refund based on the given the value based agreement. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2278.0s)]
*  So by doing this again, we a provide. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2291.0s)]
*  Frankly, it also shows our confidence about, you know, look, we're our medicines are based on genetic information based on, you know, the biology, human biology. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2294.0s)]
*  So it gives us a lot of predictability and confidence that our product's going to work. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2305.0s)]
*  And now, you know, we're just about to finalize our CV outcomes study on on our cardiomyopathy. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2310.0s)]
*  We just the labeling, I should say, we just published the Heliosp. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2318.0s)]
*  So we know these products work. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2322.0s)]
*  We know that actually it provides it provides a real benefit to the to the patient. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2325.0s)]
*  So why not actually tell the payer that we stand behind those data points? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2331.0s)]
*  And that, again, gives us an enough is every payer willing to do it? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2337.0s)]
*  No, because to your point, not everybody is equipped to do the administration of how to follow up these patients. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2341.0s)]
*  They say, ah, by the time it takes me to actually follow up the patient and administer this, it's going to get more costly. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2349.0s)]
*  But in some cases, we simplify the administration and in most cases we do. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2357.0s)]
*  So that actually works really well. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2363.0s)]
*  And then some payers believe in this and they like what they see and they stick with us. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2365.0s)]
*  Some payers don't prefer it, and that's OK. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2369.0s)]
*  So you're working directly with the insurers to help set up this this whole program of how they can manage results. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2372.0s)]
*  Do you find I mean, does it work better with insurers who have some governments, by the way, sort interrupter? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2378.0s)]
*  But in some cases, we do work X us with some governments, with governments as well. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2383.0s)]
*  Right. Is it do you look for health insurers or governments who have some experience in these kinds of deals? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2389.0s)]
*  Are you also building some of you know, forging these for the first time with some health insurers? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2396.0s)]
*  It's a little bit both. Frankly, those who have started the journey five, six years ago with us, they like what they see. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2401.0s)]
*  So they stick with us. And in some cases we publish and show them, hey, look, this is what your competitor is doing. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2408.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you like to be part of this? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2416.0s)]
*  And and and and especially those plans that look at the totality of the patients that are well integrated networks, they really like this. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2419.0s)]
*  So they not only have the insurance system, but they also they cover the patient at the payer side and and and also provider side. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2428.0s)]
*  So they actually fund the you know, the hospitals, those those systems, they really like that. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2437.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I wanted to move on to Alnylam, you know, kind of crossing back over into into larger therapeutic indications. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2444.0s)]
*  But before we leave rare disease, I wanted to ask you about diagnosis, which is a critical aspect of rare disease, getting the right diagnosis critical. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2453.0s)]
*  I'm wondering what Alnylam does, what kind of work Alnylam does in just in terms of helping patients get get diagnosed. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2463.0s)]
*  What can you tell me about that? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2471.0s)]
*  So that's your spot on the ultimate test is once you make the product available, we immediately see first of all, a pool of patients that are were already diagnosed [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2473.0s)]
*  and they are desperately looking for an option. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2484.0s)]
*  And we go and make sure that you treat that. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2487.0s)]
*  But then you need to actually continue the the the pool of patients that the flow of patients that are coming in down the pike and get them treated early. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2491.0s)]
*  So making the product available is actually a big leap forward in itself because it increases awareness. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2500.0s)]
*  The second point is we also work with diagnostic companies. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2508.0s)]
*  If it's a hereditary disorder, we work with genetic counselors. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2513.0s)]
*  We work with actually genetic diagnostic companies that provide genetic testing and assays available for the for the for the for the providers. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2520.0s)]
*  So it's essentially really becomes a question of where is the problem? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2533.0s)]
*  Is it is it really about sort of genetic testing? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2539.0s)]
*  Is it really about awareness or is it actually really improving, improving the noninvasive ways to to diagnose the patient? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2542.0s)]
*  In one instance, for instance, in TTR, we've been fortunate enough to have a scintigraphy. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2552.0s)]
*  Essentially, it's a imaging tool that is widely available in the US, but you can actually make it multipurpose. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2559.0s)]
*  And by taking a different dye, you actually essentially having the accumulation of amyloidosis in your body light up. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2571.0s)]
*  This it wasn't invented for that. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2579.0s)]
*  Now, you know, one of the institutions that we work very closely figured out that it can be used for that for that purpose. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2582.0s)]
*  So how do you actually make that available? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2589.0s)]
*  How do you actually disseminate that information? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2591.0s)]
*  So it's a really a question of understanding the value chain, where the actually you get stuck in patient diagnosis and start identifying that and working with the ecosystem. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2593.0s)]
*  Excellent. That's great. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2603.0s)]
*  I'm getting back to larger indications, hypertension, potentially Alzheimer's disease is where Alnylam is headed. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2606.0s)]
*  And I'm curious, Tolga, how you manage that evolution and scale from more, you know, rare disease indications to these, you know, very large indications across the commercial organization? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2614.0s)]
*  How do you how do you scale that up? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2629.0s)]
*  So, I mean, listen, first of all, it's very humbling because to think that you can actually come up with a potential solution. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2632.0s)]
*  Of a ship, essentially a public health problem that is inflicting pain to millions of people is incredibly rewarding. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2643.0s)]
*  So I just want you to know, like, this is an area where it gets all of us excited every morning. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2657.0s)]
*  Now, obviously, it comes with a real challenges because we started in the beginning of our conversation around how complacent we are as humans, how difficult it is to change, and how you need to start looking at it and start telling a very different narrative. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2663.0s)]
*  So a big part of commercialization actually becomes sort of market readiness. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2682.0s)]
*  And that requires a lot of resources, a lot of experiences. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2688.0s)]
*  And frankly, as great as we are as Alnylam, we also need to be humble about what we can do now and maybe what we can actually need to build as a capability. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2692.0s)]
*  So I know we can do a lot in terms of rare and even the specialty conditions. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2704.0s)]
*  I think we have the right capabilities, right talent, right infrastructure to be able to commercialize these assets. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2710.0s)]
*  But but actually dealing with a more broader public health problem requires a larger organization and a very different mindset. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2717.0s)]
*  So this time around with Zalbisiran, as you know, we actually chose a partner and I was a big advocate of doing that, even though it may it's going to require us to share some of that value. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2727.0s)]
*  But I see it as the value that we can actually create even bigger, more if we were to go along. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2739.0s)]
*  So Roche actually has done a great job in in areas like multiple sclerosis, even though that's actually more of a special disease. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2745.0s)]
*  Right, CNS conditions, yeah. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2753.0s)]
*  Exactly. What we liked about them is with Okravis, for instance, which is a very different mechanism of action. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2755.0s)]
*  They completely looked at the sort of the ecosystem very differently. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2763.0s)]
*  So I think that's what you need in a partner with similar values and similar ambitions and a different mindset that will take us there. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2767.0s)]
*  So I think that was really important for us from a capability perspective. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2775.0s)]
*  You talked about scale capability perspective. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2779.0s)]
*  You want to work with a partner that you can actually start building those muscles. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2782.0s)]
*  So we are actually doing 50 50 in the U.S. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2786.0s)]
*  Oh, you are. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2790.0s)]
*  We are a co-promoter, co-partner, and then we're letting them commercialize entire ex-U.S. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2791.0s)]
*  But the next opportunity, we want to be able to actually, you know, commercialize it by ourselves, because by the time the next large opportunity comes along, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2798.0s)]
*  I like to think that we've already had built those capabilities that I just shared with you. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2809.0s)]
*  I've been told that the 50 50 commercial split was pioneered by Regeneron. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2814.0s)]
*  Can you confirm or deny that? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2822.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2824.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if Regeneron did the deal before Pfizer and BMS did on Eloquist. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2825.0s)]
*  I can tell you. Oh, on Eloquist. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2830.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2832.0s)]
*  So that was a 50 50 split. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2833.0s)]
*  That was a 50 50 Sanofi-Sinti-Lobo and BMS before Sanofi merged with Aventus. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2835.0s)]
*  They did a 50 50 for their hypertension program. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2841.0s)]
*  So I don't know if it was really pioneered. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2845.0s)]
*  It's a very smart strategy, especially if you're again, early innings of your commercialization. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2849.0s)]
*  Great. I wanted to ask about, you know, and this this, you know, may not be important. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2857.0s)]
*  I don't it doesn't seem like these laws are going anywhere. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2864.0s)]
*  But I did notice that a few days ago, Montana, you know, had some sort of preliminary vote on a state law that would ban RNA vaccines entirely for human use. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2867.0s)]
*  Are you I mean, there's been some noise, I think, in in Idaho, maybe in Texas. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2879.0s)]
*  None of these again, none of these laws are close to coming into effect. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2885.0s)]
*  But I'm curious if it's something that that Alnylam is following and, you know, to your point about kind of setting the table for new treatments, education being a key component of that. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2891.0s)]
*  Is this something that's on your radar or not? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2904.0s)]
*  Do you think it's just sort of talk? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2906.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, listen, first of all, and first and foremost, we're a very proud American science organization. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2908.0s)]
*  And our science is based on Nobel Prize winning technology. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2916.0s)]
*  And this company is was founded in 2002. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2921.0s)]
*  And and and we've been the pioneers of introducing an entirely new class of medicine. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2925.0s)]
*  As you know, there's a lot of noise out there and there's a lot of sort of noise around, you know, genetics and, you know, RNA, mRNA. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2931.0s)]
*  We're not a vaccine. We're neither a vaccine nor actually an mRNA. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2946.0s)]
*  Right. We are actually essentially a RNA interference that is actually infrequent, but definitely, you know, another once and done kind of genetic treatment that fits very nicely into the existing ecosystem of how medicine is being treated. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2951.0s)]
*  And and I think once you explain the science and and showing the deep, deep, deep, deep safety information we have in thousands years of patient lives, I mean, we have now already five products in the market. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2975.0s)]
*  And and, you know, Novartis is obviously expanding the the aperture with hypercholesterolemia product, Lekvio, even to many more thousands of patients. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=2990.0s)]
*  We like where we are in terms of our track record. We like where we are in terms of our science and technology. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3001.0s)]
*  And we believe we need to continue to have that dialogue if if patients are worried about or the lawmakers are worried about our products. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3007.0s)]
*  We want to be out there and be able to engage the dialogue and continue to communicate. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3017.0s)]
*  So look, look, because we're standing on very, very firm foundation of our science, we have, I think, 13 or 14 published studies on New England Journal of Medicine and countless other peer review journals. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3022.0s)]
*  We stand very firmly on those on those foundations. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3040.0s)]
*  Now, it's going to be a question of are there going to be people that are misunderstanding the science and we need to explain it. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3044.0s)]
*  I think that's part of the job, Ben. And and we're up for it because we believe in what we're here to do and what we're here to provide. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3051.0s)]
*  In our last couple of minutes here, Tolga, why don't you share your your top priorities for 2025? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3061.0s)]
*  Yeah, but look, I mean, what's obviously very close to everyone, I think the whole industry is [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3069.0s)]
*  upcoming launch on our on our amputra with the cardiomyopathy indication. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3077.0s)]
*  As you may know, we have a late March PEDUFA date for in the US and then subsequently we look forward to launching the same indication in Germany and Japan and the rest of the world after the second half of the year. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3084.0s)]
*  Now, that's an important launch, not just for the obvious reasons, but what what will enable us, frankly, is to to continue to [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3102.0s)]
*  to to bring online them at the forefront of of of biotech innovation. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3111.0s)]
*  As you pointed out, we have now our pipeline is a dream for many. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3117.0s)]
*  As you pointed out on CNS, we have we have assets in hypertension and and and as well as in hematologic disorders. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3123.0s)]
*  What this launch is going to enable us to do is to actually create the cash flow that will enable us to actually refund these fund these important innovation that we're about to set out to do so. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3135.0s)]
*  Probably, I would say 60, 70 percent of my time is really focusing on on the amputra launch. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3150.0s)]
*  And frankly, this is a focus area for us for the last four years. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3158.0s)]
*  So that that that that is I'm just I just cannot wait to get out there and communicate the benefits of this incredible medicine. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3162.0s)]
*  But at the same time, continue to actually focus our organization to make the right bets on the on the on the on the pipeline and and and get the market also ready for those. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3170.0s)]
*  Those are my sort of top of mind. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3183.0s)]
*  And in the meantime, we talked about scaling. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3186.0s)]
*  Look, the way I see it is we're building skyscrapers, not just one skyscraper. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3189.0s)]
*  That's TTR and other skyscraper is the rare but the many things can come in neurological disorders and so forth. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3194.0s)]
*  What I want to make sure is that the foundation that we're building in the commercial organization can apply to each of those skyscrapers. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3202.0s)]
*  So that we can actually connect certain foundational capabilities like like a like how do we actually continue to generate data? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3209.0s)]
*  How do we actually build those access capabilities like value based agreements as a as a as a as a consistent capability? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3216.0s)]
*  How do we actually do omni-channel marketing so that the organization we can focus on real value based activities and communication on one on one peer to peer where it needs to be? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3225.0s)]
*  And surround sounded with omni-channel capabilities. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3238.0s)]
*  These things are no longer pipe dreams, right? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3241.0s)]
*  These are actually things that we deal with. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3244.0s)]
*  And I see great practices in our organization across the across the categories. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3246.0s)]
*  But I want to actually consolidate that because we essentially we're building a generational biotech. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3252.0s)]
*  And if you want to build a generational biotech, you need to have the right foundations. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3257.0s)]
*  And so some of my priorities also has a lot to do with with with that. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3261.0s)]
*  First and foremost, obviously, is winning in TTR is going to be a key key priority and a key key test for the organization. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3266.0s)]
*  That is Tolga Tangular, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Al Nilam. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3276.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Comer, and you've just listened to the business of biotech. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqgcQDzzf4&t=3282.0s)]
