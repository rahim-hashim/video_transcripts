Video Description: It wouldn't be accurate to say that surgeon-turned-healthcare investment banker and consultant Dr. Ali Pashazadeh traded his scalpels for spreadsheets. In fact, he still wields a scalpel quite frequently, and on this episode of the Business of Biotech podcast, he offers a fantastic reason why. Yes, it's a bit of a departure from our normal routine of biotech founders occupying the guest chair. But, Pashazadeh's no-holds-barred reflections on and analysis of biotech breaking points, drawn from more than 2 decades of troubleshooting broken bipharmaceutical businesses and correcting courses, makes for some great programming. Whether you're a biotech builder in the throes of disruption, or feeling lucky that you've been threading scientific, clinical, capital, and regulatory needles all along, this episode offers a ton of insight from the unwritten textbooks on the business of biotech.

# Biotech Course Correction With Treehill Partners' Ali Pashazadeh
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg)
*  There are many facets to Ali Ashzadeh, the surgeon, MBA, venture capitalist, and strategic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=0.0s)]
*  advisor who heads Treehill Partners. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=12.56s)]
*  A career spent treating patients, directing money into treatments for patients, and observing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=15.74s)]
*  the results has crystallized strong opinions on biotechnology strategy, so strong in fact [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  that Ali might refute by calling them opinions. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=29.62s)]
*  At Treehill, Ali and his team solve problems. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=34.82s)]
*  Sometimes after the problem, like a bad readout for example, has unexpectedly raised its head, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=37.78s)]
*  but mostly they solve problems before the symptoms of those problems even appear when [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=44.1s)]
*  only a sage soothsayer who's seen it coming before is qualified to course correct. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=49.1s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller, this is the Business of Biotech, and on today's show we're talking obviation, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=55.66s)]
*  preventing badness by removing its source with Treehill Partners' Ali Ashzadeh. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=61.26s)]
*  Ali, it's great to see you again. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=67.86s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  I'm thrilled to have you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=72.58s)]
*  I had the benefit for the, so our listeners know, I had the benefit of a conversation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=74.3s)]
*  with Ali, I don't know, a week, 10 days ago, and since then I've been pretty enthusiastic [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=77.82s)]
*  about getting this podcast recording done because he's got a, I'm not going to set the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  precedent or set the bar too high here for you, Ali, but he's got a pretty no holds barred [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=89.58s)]
*  approach to his take on what's right and what's wrong in biotech right now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=94.3s)]
*  But I want to start, you know, I mentioned in my little rambling prologue there that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=100.7s)]
*  you're a surgeon. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=105.38s)]
*  So that's where I want to start. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=107.26s)]
*  These background stories are always so fascinating to me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=109.9s)]
*  What does a surgeon, what motivates, I should say, a surgeon who's, you know, trained in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=113.58s)]
*  surgery to earn the MBA, get into investment banking, initially, I think, with Goldman [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=120.66s)]
*  Sachs. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=128.34s)]
*  What was the story back then? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=130.26s)]
*  What was going on in your head? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=131.26s)]
*  The story back then, I think it's a relatively linear thread in the sense of that there is [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=136.42s)]
*  a logic to what might seem like a random series of changes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=142.7s)]
*  I moved into life sciences in the late 80s, early 90s because one of our family friends [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=149.22s)]
*  died of breast cancer and I had this naive vision of curing breast cancer and going down [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  that route. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  I loved biology. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=164.78s)]
*  I loved how the human body thought, how it had multiple systems, studencies and pathways, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=166.18s)]
*  which then led me down the route of either going to marine biology or going into human [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  biology. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=177.86s)]
*  And I was talked out of marine biology into human biology and I loved my medical school [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=178.86s)]
*  years of understanding how the body functioned. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=183.02s)]
*  So the first step is understanding normality, how the body functions and how the body has [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=186.38s)]
*  multiple systems and failsafe loops and ways of course correcting. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=191.86s)]
*  And then you move on to pathology and then the minute you start moving into pathology, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=199.58s)]
*  you end up essentially adding in two camps. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=205.3s)]
*  Camp one is as a surgeon, do you like treating chronic conditions or do you like actually [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=207.74s)]
*  trying to operate on a patient, for example, or remove a tumor? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=215.38000000000002s)]
*  And then within that, you end up in a pathway where either you create the hole or you essentially [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=220.78s)]
*  fill the hole. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=227.46s)]
*  So do you enjoy taking the tumor out or do you actually try to restore normality? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=228.98s)]
*  And within that, I spent a lot of time as a plastic and reconstructive surgery, always [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=234.62s)]
*  enjoyed the acute care setting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=238.9s)]
*  So trained as a surgeon. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=241.74s)]
*  Now on a personal note, you might say, well, how did you get into that in the first place? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=243.78s)]
*  A lot of it is down to people saying, oh, you're not bright enough to get into medicine. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=248.1s)]
*  Then you get into medicine and go, oh, you're bright enough to get into surgery. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=253.06s)]
*  Then they go, you're really not really a plastic surgery person. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=256.58s)]
*  You really shouldn't do it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=260.02s)]
*  So when you look at a two dimensional human being, it looks like someone who is striving [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=261.38s)]
*  to achieve, but a lot of us are driven by usually negative experiences where people [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=267.38s)]
*  say, well, you think you could be one of the top X, Y and Z and you think, you know, I [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=271.94s)]
*  can do that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=277.3s)]
*  And then within surgery, I never wanted to leave medicine. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=278.41999999999996s)]
*  I was never looking to move out of medicine, but I was always intrigued by how relatively [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=283.3s)]
*  pedestrian the rate of evolution of how we treat patients are. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=293.06s)]
*  So moving into medicine in 1989 and now we're sitting at 2024, the treatment of the appendicitis [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=297.3s)]
*  is exactly the same treatment of appendicitis as it was at the beginning. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=303.78s)]
*  The diagnosis of meningitis is exactly the same as it was 30 years ago, for example. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=307.78s)]
*  So within that, yes, there's been huge advances in diagnostics, technology, et cetera, but [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=312.26s)]
*  there have been significant areas where things haven't improved. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=317.61999999999995s)]
*  So as I was intrigued by understanding the kind of how drugs were developed, I realized [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  the approach there probably was to marry a medical or scientific background with an [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=328.82s)]
*  investment banking background to understand how companies function, how drugs are developed. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=335.06s)]
*  And, you know, I was lucky enough to get a place at London Business School that taught [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=339.94s)]
*  me how to learn a new language of business. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  So you go from seeing patients and pathologies to spreadsheets and PowerPoints. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=348.74s)]
*  And the day before I went to London Business School, I remember doing my monthly expenses [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=354.1s)]
*  and I opened up a spreadsheet and I wrote down the numbers into each cell. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  And then on a calculator, I then added those numbers up. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=364.66s)]
*  So the day before I started in medical London Business School, I didn't know how to use [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=368.18s)]
*  Excel. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=372.42s)]
*  So all of a sudden you're now in a different language. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=372.82000000000005s)]
*  And then within that, you realize in Goldman that, you know, there are multiple incredible [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=377.62s)]
*  good companies, incredibly good drug developers that are doing exactly the same as doctors, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=384.26000000000005s)]
*  which is trying to find new therapies and advancing therapies for patients. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=391.06s)]
*  And within that, you know, I was a golden lucky enough to get into the Goldman [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=395.86s)]
*  healthcare team and stay there for a number of years and work with incredibly good people, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=400.1s)]
*  learn from them as to how drug development companies function, how they build a pipeline [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=405.22s)]
*  and how those pipelines move initially from smaller companies, a lot of times to larger [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=411.38s)]
*  companies and what really drives the market. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=415.94s)]
*  And that career then moved on to UBS. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=419.14s)]
*  And then I was fortunate enough to join Blackstone and start seeing more of the investing side [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  of things. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=429.86s)]
*  And in 2014, one of the team at Blackstone and I formed Trial Partners and tried to take [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=430.74s)]
*  investment banking and advisory a couple of steps forward in terms of what we thought [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=439.3s)]
*  kind of clients needed in order to fuse a medical scientific lens on corporate transactions. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=445.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=454.42s)]
*  When you decided to pursue the investment banking track, did you face some of the same [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=455.38s)]
*  objections? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=461.78000000000003s)]
*  Was anyone telling you you're not bright enough to be an investment banker? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=465.94s)]
*  I, but again, on a personal note, when you're incapable of using Excel, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=467.78s)]
*  because you did not call the night before and you resuscitated a five-year-old who had inhaled [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=475.7s)]
*  something, the next day you go in and you're judged by your Excel capabilities, you know, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=481.62s)]
*  you all of a sudden go from being the smartest to the dumbest quite quickly. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=488.58s)]
*  So you're now living on your wits and your horsepower, but actually, you know, you've [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=493.14s)]
*  never used Excel, you haven't used PowerPoint, you don't know what a font is. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=497.53999999999996s)]
*  And then why would you? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=500.9s)]
*  Because that's not what we needed to survive in medicine. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=501.78s)]
*  And then within, you know, it was 2001 is when the milk round along the business school, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=506.34s)]
*  the banks started coming around. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=513.22s)]
*  And I realized that I had zero chance of anybody hiring me. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=515.46s)]
*  And there was zero reason why they should hire me. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=520.1s)]
*  So what I then did at the age of kind of mid to late 20s was to break down my capabilities [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=522.34s)]
*  into components that were transferable. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=528.8199999999999s)]
*  So a person who can stand in an acute care setting can make a decision, can work off [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=531.3s)]
*  in incomplete information. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=537.22s)]
*  Where in banking does that sit? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=539.54s)]
*  You know, someone who has integrity and, you know, ask an honest question will give [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=541.14s)]
*  you an honest answer. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=545.3s)]
*  Where in banking would that fit? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=546.42s)]
*  Would that fit within consulting? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=547.86s)]
*  Would that fit in investment banking? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=549.3s)]
*  And where would the culture be? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=551.62s)]
*  So what I did is I spent probably six months working with people from Goldman, with [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=552.82s)]
*  Beryl Lynch, et cetera, trying to understand what they could possibly find in me that was [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=559.3s)]
*  interesting. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=564.1s)]
*  And out of the 700 people that learn the business school, I think I probably was the last person [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=565.14s)]
*  anybody would have expected to get an internship at Goldman. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=570.66s)]
*  And then when I got the internship, I know there was a lot of doubters that I could then [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=573.94s)]
*  convert that into a full-time offer. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=577.86s)]
*  Part of that is a desire and a, you know, being fortunate. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=580.0999999999999s)]
*  So anybody who gets somewhere, you know, can't always say that they got their base of merit. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=587.38s)]
*  And part of it was I needed the money to finish my business school degree. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=592.5799999999999s)]
*  I wasn't earning enough as a doctor to be able to fund all of London Business School. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=597.86s)]
*  So I needed the internship and I needed the silent bonus to be able to do the second year [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=604.26s)]
*  of business school. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=609.46s)]
*  So if you look at any story, again, on the CV and then you look behind the story, usually [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=610.02s)]
*  it comes from people who couldn't afford to fail and had to succeed. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=614.6600000000001s)]
*  Now, were there doubters? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=620.58s)]
*  There were absolutely doubters. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=622.1800000000001s)]
*  And I always think that you take the negativity of any doubters of can a doctor transfer to [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=623.38s)]
*  banking and you take all that negativity and you kind of put it into a tight ball and you [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=628.26s)]
*  use that as your source of driver to prove people wrong. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=634.34s)]
*  And then hopefully over time you mentor other doctors and other healthcare professionals [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=640.4200000000001s)]
*  to get into, you know, kind of learn from the mistakes. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=644.9s)]
*  But one thing that is absolutely paramount in this, you will not succeed on your own. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=647.86s)]
*  There is no way in the world Ali could have made that journey without having friends and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=654.02s)]
*  colleagues and who are now personal friends 20 years later, hold my hand and walk me down [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=659.86s)]
*  those corridors. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=664.74s)]
*  Part of the culture that Goldman had, you know, in my experience was those people also had [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=666.74s)]
*  their hands held and walked down the corridors. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=674.02s)]
*  And 20 years on, I do that for the next generation. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=676.66s)]
*  So part of it is one's own drive and one's own ability and horsepower and intelligence [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=679.86s)]
*  and drive, et cetera. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=686.74s)]
*  But a significant part of it is that people within that organization reaching over the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=687.86s)]
*  table and saying, look, I'll help you get in. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=693.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=695.94s)]
*  I've asked this question a hundred times on this podcast and in various forms, but [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=697.0600000000001s)]
*  everyone answers it with a different perspective. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=703.78s)]
*  I've interviewed hundreds of physician scientists turned, we'll say physician scientists and or [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=705.78s)]
*  academic researchers, you know, turned biotech executives. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=712.66s)]
*  And there's there are you talk about horsepower and drive. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=718.34s)]
*  I think I think there's a thread of commonality in terms of that sort of inherent innate like [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=724.42s)]
*  personality that leads them and enables them to get to the business side, right? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=730.82s)]
*  To get to biotech or biopharmaceutical leadership as opposed to scientific, you know, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=737.38s)]
*  purely scientific leadership. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=742.1800000000001s)]
*  But everyone answers that question a different way. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=745.38s)]
*  So aside from sort of that support structure that you mentioned, you know, the people around [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=748.66s)]
*  you to follow the lead, like what do you think is inherent within Ali Peshazadeh that I guess [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=752.42s)]
*  enables, right, enables from within that transition from I am a surgeon to to the business side, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=760.18s)]
*  which is a completely different language. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=768.26s)]
*  So I think some of the components, if I was looking at a junior and trying to mentor someone [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=769.54s)]
*  to, you know, kind of make a decision, first of all is are you running from something or [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=781.9399999999999s)]
*  are you running to something? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=787.86s)]
*  So are you running towards money, power, prestige, or are you someone who has a, you know, a [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=789.3s)]
*  difficult background and that difficult background drives you to succeed. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=796.0200000000001s)]
*  So the first one is you need to understand yourself and what drives you. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=799.3800000000001s)]
*  The second thing is I think there is a humility that one needs to have as a clinician, which is [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  when a patient comes in, you have a hypothesis of what that patient has and a humility to know that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=812.82s)]
*  you may be wrong. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=818.58s)]
*  And actually you need to to take a step back and learn and understand that the data that you [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=819.62s)]
*  receive from that patient or the X-ray or the CT or the MRI, you know, may completely change the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=825.78s)]
*  hypothesis you had. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=832.42s)]
*  So I think as you as you transitioning from medicine to banking or anything else is a [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=833.9399999999999s)]
*  humility to know that you may be the best microsurgeon in the country one minute. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=839.54s)]
*  The next day you need a calculator to kind of add up Excel because you didn't know there was an [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=844.18s)]
*  ad function. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=849.6999999999999s)]
*  So the first thing is the humility point. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=850.18s)]
*  Second thing is I think there needs to be to some extent a purity in what you're trying to achieve. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=852.1s)]
*  I don't see myself as a doctor turned investment banker or venture capital executive. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=859.78s)]
*  I stepped in in 1989 into medical school to learn about human biology and to help patients. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=867.5400000000001s)]
*  One tool that I used was my medical knowledge and expertise and I still do that with patients. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=875.38s)]
*  The other tool is an investment banking tool. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=884.74s)]
*  I want my driver is to help companies get products onto the market, make as few mistakes as they can [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=887.14s)]
*  and the products that should get on the market use our experience to help them get on the market. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=896.5799999999999s)]
*  The driver isn't fees, titles, you know, or any sort of limelight. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=902.02s)]
*  The objective here needs to be if you're doing it in my mind is you genuinely have a desire to help [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=909.14s)]
*  patients and that desire hasn't gone away. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=916.66s)]
*  When I step into my medical gown, it's a desire to help patients individually. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=919.38s)]
*  When this morning we had a two-hour conversation with a company that is veering off in the wrong [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=925.86s)]
*  direction in a breast cancer treatment, then we're saying look, we've worked in breast cancer for [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=932.98s)]
*  35 years. This is how we think you can get your interesting therapy to patients. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=937.14s)]
*  This is how you go from A to Z and this is how you can navigate it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=942.26s)]
*  You're not helping patient by patient, but you are helping in group patients. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=946.42s)]
*  I think that's a commonality between the two worlds. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=951.3s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to inform our listeners that when you say when I step into a gown, when I [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=954.02s)]
*  gown up, you mean that in real time because you still practice a bit of medicine. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=960.18s)]
*  I still practice medicine, yeah. I still see patients and I still have my medical license [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=964.5799999999999s)]
*  and I would do everything I could to maintain that until the day I retire. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=971.4599999999999s)]
*  Why? Why do you continue to do that? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=977.3s)]
*  It's a bit like being a pilot. If you've gone through all of the training to be a pilot [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=983.78s)]
*  and then you start lecturing people on how to fly or teaching, etc., the question people ask you is [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=990.26s)]
*  when was the last flight you did? Can you fly? Because when you're a pilot, you're in a privileged [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=996.5799999999999s)]
*  seat. You have limited standard deviation for errors and your errors have material consequences. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1002.5799999999999s)]
*  The minute you stop being a pilot and you start becoming a lecturer about how to fly, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1009.6199999999999s)]
*  you have a lifespan of three to five years before the next generation say, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1014.5799999999999s)]
*  excuse me, sir, when was the last time you flew? How do you know what it's like to fly? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1019.6999999999999s)]
*  So when I sit talking to people and they're talking to me about breast cancer treatment, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1023.4599999999999s)]
*  I can look back a month and say last fungating breast cancer I saw in an 84-year-old was a month [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1028.74s)]
*  ago. So the same fungating breast cancer that I saw in 1996, I still see in 2024. So we can talk [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1034.18s)]
*  about immunotherapy. We can talk about targeted therapies and we can talk about high-faluting [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1042.98s)]
*  stuff. But this 84-year-old did not present until she had a fungating tumor. So is hormonal breast [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1048.3400000000001s)]
*  cancer still relevant to us? Is early diagnosis and patient access still relevant to us? This is [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1055.7s)]
*  relevant in 2024 as it was in 1995 or 96. So in that context, I think unless you remain [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1060.98s)]
*  relevant and current as a doctor, you start becoming a banker who puts on a rose tinted [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1068.18s)]
*  glasses as well. When I was a doctor, I used to do this. I think for me, I wouldn't be able to [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1075.8600000000001s)]
*  respect myself unless I saw patients and I was real-time living the hypothesis of what it's like [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1081.94s)]
*  to treat patients. And I think being current and relevant, and it is difficult because I go through [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1090.34s)]
*  the same revalidation process every year as any other clinician and I'm held to the same standards [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1095.62s)]
*  as any other clinician. But what that does do is it, again, it goes back to the humility because [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1101.06s)]
*  you step into an emergency room context or a surgical theater and you're surrounded by people [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1106.6599999999999s)]
*  who are incredibly intelligent, incredibly bright, incredibly dedicated, and any sort of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1112.5s)]
*  arrogance one might have very quickly boils down to decision by decision making for patients. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1118.5s)]
*  So I think keeping yourself current is incredibly relevant to being a good banker or being a good [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1125.3s)]
*  consultant. Yeah. Where did the exposure to biotech and biopharma therapeutic endeavors [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1131.86s)]
*  come from? That was a result of your work at Goldman and UBS and Blackstone. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1142.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So exactly. So when I went to the Goldman healthcare team, the mentorship I received is, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1148.5s)]
*  look, you're coming in in your mid to late 20s, you're surrounded by incredibly smart people [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1156.5s)]
*  and they've all got five to 10 years' worth of experience. If you're twice as smart as they are, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1164.5s)]
*  it'll take you 10 years to catch up with these people. So how do they continue being smart? They [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1171.06s)]
*  continue to learn and advance themselves. What have you got which no one else has? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1175.4599999999998s)]
*  And the answer was, okay, I've got a medical background, a scientific background, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1181.9399999999998s)]
*  and I can talk to healthcare companies and understand what they do from a molecular [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1186.1799999999998s)]
*  perspective, a mechanistic perspective, and nobody else in the team does. So then when I [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1190.8999999999999s)]
*  spoke to the head of the healthcare team, he said, you don't know how to be a banker, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1195.46s)]
*  I don't know how to be a doctor, why don't you come into my team and I'll teach you what we do [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1201.22s)]
*  and you provide your input and we as a team will be a stronger team at Goldman than compared to [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1206.82s)]
*  Morgan Stanley, J.K. Morgan Bank of America. And as I gained more and more exposure to high quality [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1213.38s)]
*  companies like AstraZeneca and GSK and the high quality companies, I realized that [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1218.98s)]
*  a significant proportion of my colleagues were very, very smart, very, very capable, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1225.46s)]
*  far more capable than I was. But they didn't understand the subject matter. They didn't know [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1231.14s)]
*  the difference between a, you know, they couldn't quantify how relevant a treatment was going to be. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1237.06s)]
*  They couldn't quantify the materiality of certain decisions being made. And I thought to myself at [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1245.94s)]
*  that point, I can be quite impactful to my team within Goldman by being able to turn around and [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1253.38s)]
*  say, look, out of the 50 things that we've heard, these are the one or two bullet points that will [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1260.98s)]
*  make this transaction more likely to happen or less likely to happen. And over time, as the CEOs [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1267.3000000000002s)]
*  of those biotechs started becoming friends and colleagues, et cetera, I realized that actually [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1273.46s)]
*  there are a number of universes. One is you're sitting within a larger organization, like a GSK [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1278.42s)]
*  or AstraZeneca. And then you've got a slew of smaller companies running on a shoestring, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1283.3s)]
*  believing that they have technology or products that can change the market. And those companies [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1290.8999999999999s)]
*  are in greater need of support and help and input and guidance than obviously the GSK. So I started [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1296.98s)]
*  gravitating towards how can I work not only with the larger players, but also how can my background [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1304.1s)]
*  possibly be of help to these smaller companies that have great potential? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1309.54s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And okay, so I want to transition to problems and solutions. You had all that exposure [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1316.18s)]
*  and you began to identify probably, I'm assuming, I'm not going to put words in your mouth. You tell [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1326.18s)]
*  me where I'm wrong, but you began to identify probably some common trends around inflection [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1331.22s)]
*  points gone awry or pivot points gone awry or decisions that perhaps were made or not made [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1336.34s)]
*  that had consequences, right? So fast forward to Blackstone and the launch of Treehill Partners [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1343.86s)]
*  coming out of Blackstone, you formed up this mission at Treehill to work in the biotech [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1352.02s)]
*  white spaces. And I'm assuming those white spaces are those areas where there's criticality of [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1359.78s)]
*  decision-making or lack of decision-making that you recognize what the right decision or solution [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1366.26s)]
*  might be. But if I back up for a second, so you don't have to answer your question aside, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1376.58s)]
*  it will make. Anybody who sits here and says, I can see a white space and no one else can, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1383.22s)]
*  I can do things better than you can, is someone that shouldn't be on a podcast [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1388.26s)]
*  and shouldn't be talking to too many human beings. So you regret my use of the term soothsayer. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1392.42s)]
*  So anybody who says that, so we got to the right point, but we didn't get to the right point [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1402.42s)]
*  because of the deliberate, there was a deliberate conscious, anti-grade pathway to getting to the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1408.74s)]
*  right point. Because anybody who says that I knew I was going to sit here and I knew I was going to [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1416.82s)]
*  work with companies and prevent them making mistakes and help them get out of difficulty is someone who [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1420.58s)]
*  is drinking their own Kool-Aid. So I'm hopefully a lot more honest and transparent that Goldman, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1425.78s)]
*  if you'd ask me what is the probability of success for a phase three product, let's say 50%, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1433.46s)]
*  was a probability of success for a phase two, let's say 25%. I took that as gospel. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1438.02s)]
*  I had always assumed that the 50% that failed failed because the molecule didn't perform and [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1446.42s)]
*  didn't have the results needed to move forward. As I moved on to Blackstone, for example, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1452.34s)]
*  I started seeing there is a trend of a lot of companies that have been given advice, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1457.86s)]
*  including by us, where we're saying to them, you want to achieve A or B. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1463.1399999999999s)]
*  So let's use the Olympics as an example. You want to get to the Olympics in four years time in LA. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1468.66s)]
*  Your chances of getting to the Olympics are, you know, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 100%. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1474.5s)]
*  And this is what you need to do to get to that point. What we found is those companies receive [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1481.9399999999998s)]
*  that information and go, but what do you want to do with it? I've never done it before. I don't have [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1490.02s)]
*  the capabilities internally to do it. Can you roll up your sleeve and actually work with me to help [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1494.4199999999998s)]
*  me get to that point? So stop being the lecturer, but actually roll up your sleeves and work with [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1499.78s)]
*  us. So when we formed Trigil Partners in 2014, what we did is we took me with a scientific and [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1503.94s)]
*  medical background. We took Max with a thoroughbred pedigree investment banking. We took the former [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1510.74s)]
*  head of BDNL at AstraZeneca, former head of M&A at Allergan and put four people into a team [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1517.06s)]
*  where we had a lens. Everyone had a scientific and medical background. AstraZeneca colleague had [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1524.9s)]
*  25, 30 years worth of experience of large cap pharma. Allergan had 20 years worth of experience [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1535.22s)]
*  of how specialty pharma does it. And between us, we thought that we could help companies more than [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1541.8600000000001s)]
*  a Goldman banker, for example, or different things, because we had operational and scientific and [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1548.74s)]
*  banking backgrounds in addition to a solid investment banking offering. We then realized [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1554.98s)]
*  that it's very difficult to get someone to hire Trigil when there is hundreds of other [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1565.14s)]
*  investment banking boutiques. There are lots of very good investment banks. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1574.18s)]
*  And we had a network and we were able to generate revenue. But I realized very quickly, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1578.18s)]
*  or we realized as a team, we need to have an offering which really can't be replicated. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1584.5s)]
*  So what we did is same as medicine. If you're trying to build a reputation as a doctor, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1590.5s)]
*  you find the patient that no one else wants to operate on, nobody else wants to see, you're in [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1595.6200000000001s)]
*  a resuscitation room where you've got the patients who are five minutes away from death. That's how [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1599.78s)]
*  you build your reputation, which is exactly what I did in medicine. I was the one who was in the [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1605.46s)]
*  resuscitation room. I was the one operating on the most difficult, sickest patients, because that's [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1610.18s)]
*  how I wanted to build my reputation. So in version one of Trigil, we set up an A-principal and we [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1615.8600000000001s)]
*  said, look, this would be great. We made some mandates, we made some money. And I thought, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1623.06s)]
*  we're not going to grow from this. This is a highly competitive market with lots of very good [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1626.82s)]
*  competitors. What do people not want to do? They didn't want to deal with difficult companies and [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1630.58s)]
*  difficult situations where the trial had read out. So we built a restructuring franchise. And [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1635.9399999999998s)]
*  over the past decade or so, we've done over 100 corporate turnarounds, companies that have had [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1641.78s)]
*  share price declines of 50, 60, 70%, where you step in as a parachuting in as a team, where you say, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1647.86s)]
*  okay, this is how you deal with your debt holders. This is how you deal with the equity holders. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1653.9399999999998s)]
*  This is the PR you go out with. This is the IR you go out with. This is how you go back to your [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1658.98s)]
*  PI when it comes to the study. This is the non-deal roadshow you put in place. This is how we change [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1664.5s)]
*  the website. And because we've done it over 100 times, we get parachuted into very difficult [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1669.46s)]
*  situations. And within a week, we're part of the fabric of that company, because we've seen it [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1675.46s)]
*  when it goes wrong, we've seen it repeatedly. Did we want to go into that situation? Honestly, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1680.6599999999999s)]
*  no, that's not where we started out to. But we realized that no advisory firm was in that position. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1686.34s)]
*  Then there's a second. So that's version two of Treehill. Version three was we were seeing 100 [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1692.02s)]
*  companies out of just say, 1000, who had been in difficult situations. And we thought to ourselves, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1698.1799999999998s)]
*  okay, this is the unfortunate 50% of companies that fail in phase three, for example. So going [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1703.62s)]
*  back to Goldman, Goldman, we were saying, me, I'm not talking about Goldman, I'm talking about [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1709.06s)]
*  Ali within Goldman. At Goldman, we'd say 50% of drugs fail because it's the drugs fault. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1714.02s)]
*  Now roll the clock forward, you know, 15, 20 years, you now start seeing a pattern of companies that [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1720.42s)]
*  have failed. And you ask yourself the question, maybe it's not the molecule. Maybe it's the way [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1727.1399999999999s)]
*  we've developed that molecule, which has led to the failure. Maybe it's a clinical trial design [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1733.46s)]
*  that has led to that failure. And we were fortunate enough to work with a number of the global CROs. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1739.06s)]
*  So now you're seeing the sausage being made. And we realized, and this is our hard moment that came [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1744.74s)]
*  in 20 years after, kind of going into banking, where you go, I can see why you made a decision [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1749.94s)]
*  in your phase two way, which I as a banker would have seen five or six years down the road that [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1759.54s)]
*  would have led you down the wrong pathway. So step one is led to be a banker. Step two is, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1765.94s)]
*  once it's gone wrong, how do you how do you try and fix it? Step three is, what decision led to [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1772.98s)]
*  that mistake. So if you look at Treehill today, we can now sit with a company and we can say, okay, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1778.66s)]
*  it's a healthy company. And the company wants you to develop a product in a sudden indication, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1785.54s)]
*  you're now running the binomial tree in an anti-grade manner, you need to do this, this, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1791.62s)]
*  this, and you will get the target product profile that you desire. That target product profile will [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1797.3s)]
*  need to have certain characteristics, which means that by the time of launch, which might be five [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1803.1399999999999s)]
*  years, six years, eight years, the competitive landscape means that target product profile is [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1807.46s)]
*  competitive. And companies will say, okay, that's great. So you'll work with me on TPP delineation [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1811.86s)]
*  at the time of launch. Then they say, what is my clinical development pathway? So what is my CDP [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1819.3s)]
*  that then leads me to that TPP? And we can work with companies in an anti-grade manner and say, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1825.06s)]
*  okay, you want to go into breast, you want to go into pancreatic, you want to go into whatever the [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1831.7s)]
*  indications of ophthalmology or other indications. These are the steps that you need to take between [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1836.74s)]
*  here and time of launch to have a commercially relevant product. Now, once you have a commercially [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1842.02s)]
*  relevant product, now you have a fundable transactable company, which means that you'll [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1847.94s)]
*  be 5% of the companies that succeed. So the aha moment here is looking at oneself and saying, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1852.5800000000002s)]
*  we shouldn't have 50% failure in phase three. We shouldn't blame the molecule. What if we stop [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1860.98s)]
*  blaming the molecule for a second and we blamed ourselves? And by the way, it's going back to [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1867.38s)]
*  medicine. In medicine, if you have a mistake or you have a patient, you operate on a patient with a [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1872.26s)]
*  complication. First thing you do is you blame yourself. What did I miss? What mistakes did I [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1877.14s)]
*  make? The humility to go back and say, look, maybe I got it wrong before you blame the patient. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1881.8600000000001s)]
*  In drug development, I think up to this point, there has been almost a get out of jail card, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1887.5400000000002s)]
*  which is well, 50% fail. And I think what we try to do at Segal now is work with companies and say, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1895.46s)]
*  how can we help you develop drugs better? How can we help you prevent making those mistakes? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1902.3400000000001s)]
*  And how does that lead to you raising money? How does that lead to you consummating transactions? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1908.74s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Tell us the mistakes. I want to maybe dig into some stories around [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1917.38s)]
*  the mistakes, offer some real, you know, obviation value to our listeners. And I know it's a tough [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1923.46s)]
*  question to ask. It's a tough question to answer. But give us some scenarios where, you know, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1933.5400000000002s)]
*  perhaps it's not a parachute in and save a specific problem challenge that you're facing [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1939.14s)]
*  with a client. But it's one of those situations where you're kind of doing that, what do you call [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1944.2600000000002s)]
*  it? Like your back back backfilling the analysis? Yeah, you dig a regression analysis on decision [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1951.46s)]
*  making. So if I use a binomial tree as the basis for the answer, if you look at a binomial tree, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1958.3400000000001s)]
*  the binomial tree is efficient. So if you look at each node, in between each node, the market is [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1965.54s)]
*  highly efficient. Tree Hill has no value to that. Companies will do excellent work. Consultants will [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1972.58s)]
*  do excellent work. Bankers will do excellent work. You can't improve on the on from a node to node [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1980.66s)]
*  decision making in the binomial tree. Where the mistakes are made is looking at beyond one or two [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1986.42s)]
*  nodes. And if you look at node one, for example, and node 10. So when you when you work with a [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=1993.38s)]
*  company, in the first stages, they need a good scientific team who understand the science, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2000.26s)]
*  then you start moving into a group that needs a medicinal background and drug ability background [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2006.42s)]
*  or the CMC background. Then you move into a team that actually needs a early drug development [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2012.5s)]
*  background and capabilities. And then you move into a team that needs more of a later state drug [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2018.1000000000001s)]
*  development capabilities and commercial focused. Those teams are not the same individuals. So where [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2024.3400000000001s)]
*  we see mistakes being made is where people don't realize that their time frame of working on that [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2030.9s)]
*  drug has come to an end. And they need to bring other capabilities in on board. So it's and when [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2039.94s)]
*  decisions are made, decisions are made on incomplete and inaccurate information. So people, for example, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2046.8200000000002s)]
*  get a great drug, they get it through talks, they get it through drug ability, they have drug stability, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2053.3s)]
*  and then you say to them, so face to face where we see the most mistakes, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2061.14s)]
*  how did you choose your indication? Well, I was at a conference and there was a KOL [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2065.54s)]
*  or a PI said really interested in pancreatic. Okay, so so you've done all this work for 10 years, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2069.94s)]
*  now got to industry indication selection. Did you look at other indications? Did you look at [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2077.38s)]
*  breast? Did you look at glioblastoma? Did you look at pediatric? You know, did you look at ovarian? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2083.62s)]
*  What did you look at? None of this PI told me they're really interested. Now, when that that [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2088.82s)]
*  conversation has been had a couple of times, boards, investors, management, then are almost wedded to [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2094.9s)]
*  that decision. So when we come in as tree hell, and we say, okay, you've chosen indication A or [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2102.26s)]
*  indication B. Have you thought about taking a step back in the node? So to go back one step in the [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2107.54s)]
*  node and say, and what if we chose a different indication? Because if you look at that in the [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2113.46s)]
*  other indication, your mechanisms of action could also work in endometrial, for example, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2119.14s)]
*  your indication could also work in glioblastoma, and your drug could be more attractive in that [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2124.34s)]
*  indication that's an easier pathway to develop. And what we find is few companies take a take a [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2130.82s)]
*  step where they take a pause, where they say, I've made this decision, but was this the right [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2140.42s)]
*  decision to make? Because admitting that that might be a suboptimal decision is not within our DNA. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2146.7400000000002s)]
*  So that again goes back to humility point. So, you know, as a scientist, you're always trying to [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2155.14s)]
*  disprove the null hypothesis, you're always going back and saying, was I right? Was I right? Was I [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2159.2200000000003s)]
*  right? Do I need to change anything? But when you start moving to drug development, and this is the [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2163.54s)]
*  aha moment, as we're working with those CROs, we realize that when companies were approaching us [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2169.3s)]
*  and saying, look, Ali and the team, we're thinking of going into indication A or B or C, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2175.1400000000003s)]
*  we could work with them and say, look, why don't we work with you and work through which is the [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2180.6600000000003s)]
*  indications make sense? Incredible receptivity. So give you some statistics in terms of [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2184.7400000000002s)]
*  how widespread we think this is. We looked at over 1200 studies, and that's now increased to [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2192.26s)]
*  1400 studies. Only 5% of the studies that we looked at were developed with a commercially [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2197.7s)]
*  targeted TPP at the time of launch. So only 5% of people put the GPS coordinates into knowing [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2204.98s)]
*  where they were going at the beginning. Yeah, 85% of studies had one or two material flaws. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2212.4199999999996s)]
*  60% of studies, it was very difficult to understand what the clinical utility of those studies were. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2221.54s)]
*  So he's like, why are you doing the study? Oh, the FDA like it. But the FDA, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2227.14s)]
*  EMER isn't going to tell you not to do a study. They're there for patient safety. They're not [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2231.54s)]
*  there for efficacy or commercial relevance. So when you applied an investor's lens to it, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2235.62s)]
*  as an investor, I don't need you to do that study. You either do a registration study, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2241.46s)]
*  or you do a de-risking study, but you're doing a study just to generate data. So we found that [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2246.66s)]
*  there's a huge white space, and there's receptivity as we work with CROs, there's [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2252.66s)]
*  receptivity as we work with biotechs, because one, you're preventing people making mistakes, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2257.62s)]
*  because you're testing the robustness of decisions made. Two, we can reduce the cost of a study by [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2264.18s)]
*  about 30%. And we've done that relatively consistently over the past 18 months. We've [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2271.46s)]
*  reduced the timeline of drug development by eight to nine months. I think we've reduced the error [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2278.98s)]
*  rate, but you never know the error rate until errors are made. But we've picked up quite a lot [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2284.98s)]
*  of things that could have been improved. The change order, as in when you start a clinical study, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2289.78s)]
*  the industry change order is 18%. So when Ali starts a clinical study, and I say it's going to [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2295.7s)]
*  be 100 million, statistically, I'm going to be spending 118 million on our study. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2302.26s)]
*  Our change order at this point is low single digit. So again, if you go back to why did I, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2308.1s)]
*  at the beginning of this discussion, why did I move into medicine? Why did I move into banking? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2315.2999999999997s)]
*  We moved in, or I moved in, because I wanted to get better drugs to patients in a more effective, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2322.1s)]
*  efficient way. And for that reason, I think I'm now through some deliberate actions and some [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2328.58s)]
*  aha moments that I hadn't expected. I think we're now as Treehill in a position where we [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2339.7s)]
*  can work with companies and truly advise them how to get their products to patients in a most [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2344.5s)]
*  efficient, cost efficient, and time efficient manner. Yeah. I want to go back to that [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2349.94s)]
*  indication decision making process that you talked about a bit. And short of, I'll simplify [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2356.58s)]
*  it. I'll dumb it way down. Short of me making an indication decision because I've heard from Ali [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2363.06s)]
*  six times at a trade show, he's a KOL, and he's giving me attention. That's dumbing it down. But [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2372.5s)]
*  well, we went in that direction because that's where the attention was. And maybe that's folly. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2377.94s)]
*  Why aren't biotechs casting wider net and exploring more indications? Is it expensive to [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2384.26s)]
*  do? Is it challenging to do? Is it too time consuming to do? Why wouldn't they just naturally [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2392.66s)]
*  do that anyway? It's a different binomial tree. You've ended one binomial tree, you've now moved [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2398.34s)]
*  to another one. So one is a scientific binomial tree. Now you need to move on to a medical one. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2404.18s)]
*  So where in pancreas is other white spaces, where in glioblastoma is a white spaces, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2410.2599999999998s)]
*  where in AMD are the white spaces. And if you are a scientist, you're not able to sorry, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2416.66s)]
*  most of the scientists that we know. Let me back up for a second. And I'll be maybe a little bit [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2428.1s)]
*  more brutal this. You have a chief scientific officer typically, and typically they're very [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2434.9s)]
*  capable, they do the scientific work. Then they bring a chief medical officer on board because [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2440.5s)]
*  they go, I need a chief medical officer who's going to help me on indication selection. Now, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2445.2200000000003s)]
*  what we've seen over the past 20 years consistently is, if you hire yourself a glioblastoma chief [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2450.82s)]
*  medical officer, and you look at the past three studies they ran, and those studies, the glioblastoma [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2456.1800000000003s)]
*  studies, for example, surprise, surprise, which study do you think they're going to run for your [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2461.2200000000003s)]
*  drug? Yeah. And a oncology CMO is a very different beast to an ophthalmology CMO. So as you're going [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2464.74s)]
*  through things, you're, and we said, we said, you know, when we work with companies and we're [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2477.14s)]
*  telling them, look, your CMO selection is the most crucial recruitment event in your company's [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2481.9399999999996s)]
*  history, because that CMO will decide which pathway you go down. That CMO will work with [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2491.38s)]
*  the organization and external advisors and CROs to set up a clinical study that'll take them a year [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2497.78s)]
*  or two. That study will run for a year or two. So four or five years down the road, you'll realize [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2503.54s)]
*  whether you did, made the right decision, right clinical study design, and the right outcome. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2508.82s)]
*  If you get it wrong, you've just made a five year mistake. And then you've got to go back to the [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2514.7400000000002s)]
*  beginning of it. So I think what happens is people look at it in two dimensions. They say, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2519.78s)]
*  I've got a drug that can go for the such and such an indication. What have people done before? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2526.5s)]
*  Oh, people have this mechanism of action. They've got into AMD. They go to a couple of [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2533.46s)]
*  conferences. They hire some good consultants and everyone goes, yeah, AMD makes perfect sense. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2537.86s)]
*  I don't think there is as much robustness in the decision making process as there could be. So if [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2543.2200000000003s)]
*  we look at a couple of products in, in Takeda, they went down the breast cancer route. They get [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2549.3s)]
*  picked up by the Roy Vance of the world and go into a completely separate indication. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2556.34s)]
*  We looked at those products and we said, how did you as a large, incredibly respectable organization [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2561.38s)]
*  go down that route? Well, that team thought it was the right thing to do. When they generated the data, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2567.3s)]
*  they now handed it to a new team. The two teams hadn't talked to each other. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2574.66s)]
*  Yeah. So we see that quite often. So I think it's, again, if you're looking at drug development, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2579.7s)]
*  you need a team that is able to have a conversation about a molecule at the same time, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2586.1s)]
*  that in the same room, someone who's actually launched a product. And yes, they're 10 to 15 [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2594.5s)]
*  years away from each other, but what you do today and tomorrow or the next day needs to be vetted [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2600.26s)]
*  by the commercial person or be relevant to the commercial person. Otherwise you're developing [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2607.7000000000003s)]
*  a drug like a pattern. You know, you need to know where you're going. Yeah. Yeah. And I've had, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2612.42s)]
*  I've had conversations with a lot of biotech leaders about, I guess the chronology and cadence [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2617.5400000000004s)]
*  of hiring decisions and specific leadership disciplines on the continuum, right? Like when [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2623.14s)]
*  do we hire a CSO? When do we hire a chief medical officer? When do we hire a chief regulatory [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2630.5s)]
*  officer? When do we hire a chief commercialization officer? And it doesn't sound formulaic. It doesn't [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2636.18s)]
*  sound like there's a formulaic approach to doing that, but it sounds like those decisions are [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2643.14s)]
*  crucial to the strategy that you're discussing, right? Like does Treehill advise on that, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2649.86s)]
*  for that HR element? Yeah. So we don't advise on the HR element. We actually perform that role. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2657.78s)]
*  So we developed a clinical development optimization model and I wanted to pick three [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2663.2200000000003s)]
*  letters, so CDO model. And because I know why not everyone else has three letters. And the CDO model [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2668.34s)]
*  is we will work with the company, the board, their investors and external consultants. So [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2675.06s)]
*  it's not just a treehill effort. And the objective there is optimizing your drug development as the [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2682.34s)]
*  word, as the CDO kind of says, label says. And the objective there is exactly as I said before, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2689.2999999999997s)]
*  30% reduction in cost of development, nine to 12 months reduction in timeline, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2697.62s)]
*  taking your change order from your industry, 18% down to low single digit. And in each of [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2703.9399999999996s)]
*  those situations being far more robust in the way that TPP is developed and commercially relevant [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2712.2599999999998s)]
*  and putting a robust team in place that not only puts the CDP in place, but oversees the CDP [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2720.1s)]
*  throughout the development of the cycle. And we've been working with Fosun Pharma USA. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2726.58s)]
*  The large Chinese company was one of the first companies to adopt this. And that has been [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2734.34s)]
*  instrumental in identifying interesting molecules that can be developed for the US market using the [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2739.86s)]
*  CDO model. So on that one, if we need to bring in a CMO for a specific indication, we will help [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2747.38s)]
*  identify that person, help bring that person to work with that person to put the CDP in place. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2756.02s)]
*  Yeah. All right. I want to get your perspective on, I'm just thinking as we're discussing this, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2761.94s)]
*  I'm thinking like internally, right? Like I'm Matt Piller and this is my bio, you know, Acme [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2767.94s)]
*  Biotech is my biotech company and we're developing around molecule. And I've got a team of people who [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2773.14s)]
*  are, you know, qualified to help me move from node to node to node in the traditional node to [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2779.94s)]
*  node to node sense, right? And maybe I've got, you know, the benefit of some foresight, you know, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2787.7000000000003s)]
*  I can, maybe I can look six nodes down. That's good. I can look six nodes down the line. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2793.38s)]
*  I might be able to implement that internally, build it into my culture, say, hey, this is out, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2800.66s)]
*  the road maps here, but there are outside, you know, maybe traditional institutions [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2805.86s)]
*  in the biotech landscape or on the biotech landscape that have influence, that exert some [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2813.2200000000003s)]
*  pressure, right, on my company and hundreds and hundreds of others. They're investors perhaps, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2821.38s)]
*  right? Like I need to show some stuff, I need to show some movement on these, you know, on the [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2828.42s)]
*  trajectory from node to node to node to continue to attract investment dollars. Maybe they're [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2834.34s)]
*  regular, maybe they're the regulatory agencies, FDA and EMA, who are like, you know, in order for [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2839.06s)]
*  me to move down the regulatory continuum, I've got to show in the, you know, sort of traditional [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2844.26s)]
*  paradigm, some progress. How do I deal with those? Like, how do I deal with those? Maybe it's my [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2850.26s)]
*  board, right? I got a board that comes from the traditional, you know, the traditional biotech [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2856.5s)]
*  space or biopharmaceutical space, and their expectations are based on just the way we've [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2862.9s)]
*  always done it. So I guess the question of I'm trying to be concise about it is how do I deal [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2867.62s)]
*  with the external influences that may kind of stand in the way of the efficiency that you're [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2872.5s)]
*  describing, right? Just based on history and tradition. You're completely correct. The human [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2881.7000000000003s)]
*  capital and the management of human capital, the management of human interaction is the hardest [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2889.54s)]
*  part of this. My approach and Treehill's approach is being, we will keep our, if you ask us an honest [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2896.58s)]
*  question, we'll give you an honest answer that is independent of politics, independent of P&L, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2906.2599999999998s)]
*  you know, for us, and independent of benefit, something that would benefit Treehill, for example. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2912.8199999999997s)]
*  So we will tell you exactly what we think in an unsiltered way. We don't get involved in [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2917.78s)]
*  company politics, and we step in and say, look, this is what we've seen. This is what we think [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2922.5800000000004s)]
*  you should do. What we find is certain companies are so embroiled in the, I always call it molecule [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2928.6600000000003s)]
*  in a context. That program or that molecule is in the context. I'd say 50% of the time we can help [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2938.98s)]
*  that program if we can solve the context. But at 50% of the time, we can't solve the context. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2949.38s)]
*  So you've got an angry board, you've got an angry shareholder, you've got legal constraints, you've [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2955.94s)]
*  got all sorts of factors where, you know, if you have an honest, you know, sit down session, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2962.1s)]
*  where you roll your sleeves up and say, look, guys, I know this is what you're trying to achieve. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2969.22s)]
*  That's not how the world is played out. This is what we have. This is how we can all win. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2972.66s)]
*  As long as we're going for a win-win, which we think we can guide you through, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2977.46s)]
*  everybody needs to come to the table with a compromise of some sort. What we find is when [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2982.02s)]
*  people are reasonable, you can almost always find that compromise. So I'll give you an example of [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2987.94s)]
*  this. US company, face free assets has spent 110 million to recruit 12 patients over a three year [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=2992.82s)]
*  period. This trial was not recruiting. And we had a conversation with the management and said to them, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3003.06s)]
*  you need to kill your face free. This just isn't recruiting. The way it was set up, this trial just [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3009.62s)]
*  you will do better by terminating that study, taking your follow on compound, designing a face [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3015.94s)]
*  free, and you will get a readout quicker than the study will continue recruiting. Now the 30 to 40 [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3022.7400000000002s)]
*  million spent on that product over the next on that study, over the course of the next 12 months, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3029.3s)]
*  new management came in, new management came back and said, why didn't we listen to your advice [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3034.98s)]
*  12 months ago, 30 million ago? How would you kill the face free without killing our share price? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3039.86s)]
*  And we said, look, you need to be honest with you. This is a US listed company. You need to be honest [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3045.7000000000003s)]
*  with your investors. You need a non-deal roadshow. You need to go around to all your research analysts. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3050.58s)]
*  You need to go around to each of your investors and you need to explain to them, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3055.3s)]
*  you know, to the extent you can based on confidentiality and disclosure, etc. You need [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3059.2200000000003s)]
*  to work with your IR companies. You need to go around and you need to educate the market. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3063.78s)]
*  The share prices move because people are surprised. You need to go around and you need to do one, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3068.5s)]
*  the right thing for shareholders, two right thing for patients. And you need to go around and have [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3073.62s)]
*  a, an honest conversation where you take the bull by the horn and you let people know, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3078.74s)]
*  obviously with lawyers involved and everything else, that you're about to kill a face free that [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3085.78s)]
*  you spend 150 million on. The board M.Denard for six months spent another 15 million came back and [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3089.46s)]
*  said, we think we're going to do that now. And he said, okay, what do you think the share price [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3096.98s)]
*  reaction will be like it won't move? So like the 80% of our share price is linked to the phase three. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3101.86s)]
*  We said, well, it isn't. We've spoken to your top shareholders. We've spoke to your research [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3107.94s)]
*  analysts and it isn't. Yeah. Their price moved 1.2%. Yeah. On the day the market moved 2%. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3111.78s)]
*  We've done that repeatedly. So when you say to people, look, if you want a solution, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3119.22s)]
*  there is a solution there, but we need to remove the context of the program. So everyone put [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3123.78s)]
*  emotions aside. Let's move into the surgical theater component. If there is something that [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3129.2200000000003s)]
*  we need to cut out, we need to cut it out. If you don't want to cut out, then you know, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3134.1800000000003s)]
*  this is going to fail. Then you can all blame each other. And, and, and sometimes they blame us. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3139.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, we step in and say, look, this is what we think you need to fix it. Then they turn around [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3144.5800000000004s)]
*  and go, well, you should have advised us five years before you knew us. And you go, well, look, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3148.74s)]
*  I'm not part of the, you know, I'm not the patient. I'm the one you came to see in the ER [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3154.3399999999997s)]
*  department. I didn't make you sick. So on this one, when people, it's a human capital, again, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3158.1s)]
*  going back to the 50% of phase threes failed because of the molecule humans, I'd say most of [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3164.9799999999996s)]
*  the time when you say to someone, I think we need to course correct, it's not new information to them. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3173.3s)]
*  They go, we've been saying the same thing. We just can't get it past the board. We can't get the [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3180.1800000000003s)]
*  shareholders. And then we work with people either frontline or behind the scenes and saying, look, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3185.3s)]
*  this is how we convince other people to make that decision. Yeah. I get the sense that, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3191.0600000000004s)]
*  uh, yeah, not to, not to put too, uh, too sharp a point on it. I get the sense that at least at [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3197.38s)]
*  first blush at first meeting boards, boards don't necessarily care for tree hills involvement. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3203.1400000000003s)]
*  No, no, boards are actually very receptive. Really? Yeah. Boards are very receptive. I think, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3210.02s)]
*  I think we get pulled in by boards more often than we get pulled in by management. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3214.42s)]
*  Because, you know, I, I, I've been on boards, I am on boards, you know, we've done a whole analysis [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3220.42s)]
*  of how much boards know about a company. Uh, we have this whole metric by, by which, you know, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3225.14s)]
*  we do this analysis where we asked the company 900 questions and we went through CEO, CMO, CSO, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3230.2599999999998s)]
*  et cetera, asked about their role, their function, then asked them about each other's role or [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3238.3399999999997s)]
*  function. And then we went to the board members and we did this in over a hundred companies [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3243.8599999999997s)]
*  and went in, then we came up with the conclusion. We then went to the board members and said, how [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3248.3399999999997s)]
*  much of this did you know? And they said between five to 10% is like 6.7% of that information did [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3254.66s)]
*  the boards have. So when a board is making a decision, it's making a decision based on [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3261.3799999999997s)]
*  incomplete and a lot of times, um, relatively selective information they're receiving. So a [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3267.22s)]
*  lot of times when boards, um, turn around and say, look, can we get you guys as tree hill to step in? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3273.22s)]
*  We want you to work with management. We don't want to get into any sort of running battles. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3279.46s)]
*  Can you just lay out the land that we have? We have this call this morning. Um, it's a board that [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3283.62s)]
*  has invested 250 million in the company. They're trying to figure out where they go next. They pull [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3288.9s)]
*  this in. Uh, these are people who put their own money in their own blood and sweat and tears. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3294.98s)]
*  And it's angry. We want an honest opinion. Tell us what you think we should do. Work with management [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3299.62s)]
*  to get us to a place where we think we need to get to. So actually contrary to what you, you think [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3305.3s)]
*  boards actually pull us in, but they can only pull you in under a couple of guises. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3310.58s)]
*  One, they're asking an honest question and they're expecting an honest answer to they're asking you [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3314.58s)]
*  a question which you're going to answer in a selfless manner. So a lot of times you give people [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3319.94s)]
*  advice that doesn't result in more money for tree hill. And they, they, they need to know that when [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3324.8199999999997s)]
*  they're looking into your eyes, you're giving them the honest advice, which is the best advice [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3331.86s)]
*  company, not the best advice for you as an advisor. Yeah. I guess I just assumed that if a board, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3335.7s)]
*  you know, is, is boarding well and you know, you also assume that boards come with a fair, a fair [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3341.9399999999996s)]
*  amount of fair share of ego, right? A fair amount of ego on the board. I guess I just assumed that [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3348.4199999999996s)]
*  if that were the case, then in everything we're going swimmingly, you know, why would we need tree [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3353.2999999999997s)]
*  hill? Yeah. I don't think so. So that is that naive is like, it's not naive, but it, but if you, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3360.1s)]
*  let me use NASCAR's analogy, NASCAR, NASCAR analogy. Now you're speaking to the American [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3369.14s)]
*  audience here. Go with this movie for a second. I may stumble over it. If you're racing at NASCAR, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3375.06s)]
*  if you look at the NASCAR teams, there is an unlimited deck of driver talent, engineering [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3382.2599999999998s)]
*  talent, marketing talent, so on and so forth. If you step in as a privateer, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3388.9s)]
*  nobody cares that your car is a privateer car. When the scoreboards come out, they look at it [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3395.54s)]
*  and say, okay, were you first, second, third or fourth? So privateers need to act and behave [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3400.6600000000003s)]
*  and compete at a standard, which is, which is, which is, you know, world leading when it comes to [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3408.5s)]
*  that specific type of racing. When you're developing a drug and you want that drug to be [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3416.02s)]
*  licensed by GSK AstraZeneca or Novartis, what would make you think that you can develop that drug [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3421.86s)]
*  in anything but exactly the same high quality manner as a GSK AstraZeneca or Novartis? If you [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3428.9s)]
*  develop the drug to your standard and not to their standard, and you think your standard is any [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3435.3s)]
*  different, do not expect that at any point they're going to pick up your drug. So can [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3440.74s)]
*  Triale be helpful in your journey? We think we can. Can we, will we be stronger together, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3447.54s)]
*  make less mistakes together? I think we will be. And if we work well, you're receptive, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3454.9799999999996s)]
*  and we're lucky, we might be able to hit the GSK and AstraZeneca and Novartis and Roche standards. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3462.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. If we are driven by ego and by desire to be right, as opposed to doing the right thing, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3468.82s)]
*  we're not going to be matching the levels of your large cat farmer, and we're never going to win a [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3478.1000000000004s)]
*  NASCAR race. We're just not going to. Yeah. You know, what do we like? We like the, you know, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3484.5s)]
*  Carroll Shelby story. Why do we like that? Because we like the underdog. We want to show, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3491.2999999999997s)]
*  but then, you know, Ford couldn't get there on their own. Ford had to get Carroll Shelby in, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3499.2999999999997s)]
*  and Carroll Shelby had to bring his own driver in. Did Ford actually, did the middle layer of [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3504.8199999999997s)]
*  Ford fight that? They did fight it because it was showing their inability to actually deliver. And [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3512.02s)]
*  why should Carroll, who's Carroll Shelby to be able to help Ford? You wouldn't expect a group [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3518.34s)]
*  of 10, 15 individuals to be able to change a behemoth's behavior. But what we found in that [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3524.02s)]
*  example, which is again, it's thinking to a racing analogy, is that people were receptive enough and [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3529.94s)]
*  humble enough to understand that Carroll Shelby and his team could actually make it, make a [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3536.9s)]
*  difference for Ford. And that relationship continues to today. What we do at Treehill, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3541.78s)]
*  we're not arrogant in a sense of we don't have the answers. We have seen a lot of mistakes. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3547.7000000000003s)]
*  We have been in the trenches when difficult decisions were made or right decisions made, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3555.1400000000003s)]
*  but had bad outcomes. All we do is to sit down with you guys and say, look, we've got a big team. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3561.5400000000004s)]
*  Everyone on the team has 20, 25 years of drug development expertise. We together can hopefully [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3568.42s)]
*  make better decisions, better informed decisions, and either prevent us making mistakes in the [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3574.9s)]
*  future. And if things have gone wrong, I can't think of a better, more seasoned team that people [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3580.26s)]
*  sit in and say, I was in that room with the FDA when I got a complete response letter. I was in [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3586.6600000000003s)]
*  the room where they dropped my file of API and I can't start the clinical study. I was in the [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3593.38s)]
*  room when that CRO did this. I was in the room where my share price went down 80% for something [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3600.82s)]
*  that I... So being in that room, all it does is gives you enough scars and enough experience to [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3607.46s)]
*  say, just think about this as you're making a decision and your company, your decision. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3615.94s)]
*  This is how we are providing additional lens that is, again, hopefully selfless [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3622.58s)]
*  in you making the best decision you can make. Yeah. We're running short on time, Ali, but do [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3631.3799999999997s)]
*  you have time for a couple more? Yep. A couple more. First of all, are you a motorsports guy? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3638.74s)]
*  A lot of motorsports. Yeah. Formula one, I assume. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3644.4199999999996s)]
*  I don't know anything. Anything with attention. Yeah, that's cool. You talked about ego. Your [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3650.5s)]
*  response just now alluded to some potentially emotional stuff, right? Like you're the leader [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3658.8999999999996s)]
*  of the company. This is your ship. We're coming in objectively. And I imagine, if you think about [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3665.06s)]
*  what motivates emotionally, what motivates a biotech leader and the biotech leader's teams, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3671.8599999999997s)]
*  it might be a sense of purpose, altruism. It might be money. It might be that adrenaline rush of [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3678.42s)]
*  discovery, societal impact. Any number of things motivate these leaders. And every single one of [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3685.3s)]
*  those things has a strong emotion tied to it. And not everyone can shelve that emotion. It's [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3692.9s)]
*  not easy to be objective when you have an emotional attachment to what you're doing. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3698.6600000000003s)]
*  So how do you manage that? And I guess not only how do you manage it, you and Treehill, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3702.2599999999998s)]
*  but what advice do you have for people on the client side, biotech leaders, for managing their [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3708.58s)]
*  own emotions around important decisions? You talk about, a few minutes ago, you were talking about [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3714.74s)]
*  killing $150 or $180 million investment in a phase three trial. That's emotional stuff. I [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3720.74s)]
*  don't care how objective you pretend to be. So what do you do? How do you work through that [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3727.3s)]
*  emotion when your consult is, I imagine, sometimes, maybe often, not exactly what your client wants to [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3732.98s)]
*  hear? There's a couple of things. So going into the surgical context, 30 years after graduating, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3739.7000000000003s)]
*  20 nights after you're graduating, any surgeon who says, I didn't go home and cry after losing [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3751.62s)]
*  a patient or seeing something that day is stopping true to themselves. I think if you're looking for [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3757.38s)]
*  longevity, you need to make sure that you have a coping mechanism. And that coping mechanism isn't [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3765.06s)]
*  alcohol-based or drug-based or some sort of self-harm-based. So you need to find a [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3771.14s)]
*  positive outlet, whether it's travel, motorsports, whatever it is, there needs to be a positive route [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3776.74s)]
*  because you're absorbing a lot of negative input and you need to be able to stay in the moment and [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3782.66s)]
*  you need to be calm and collected and the ice cold when you're coming to making decisions. Now, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3790.74s)]
*  the minute you step out of that context and the patient is, you know, you've dealt with a patient [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3799.22s)]
*  situation, you can go home and cry, but you're paid and your role as a professional in that [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3803.94s)]
*  moment is to be ice cold. And over the past 30 years, I mean, besides that many times, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3810.5s)]
*  you don't show any emotion. You're not paying me to show emotion now. I can go home and cry [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3816.1s)]
*  or I can do whatever I want to do or, you know, kind of punch a wall. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3821.46s)]
*  By the way, real quick, I was actually quite proud of myself. I got you to smile and laugh [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3826.9s)]
*  a couple of times on this part. But in the moment, you're ice cold and I think that it's [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3831.62s)]
*  a genetic point in the sense of for me, the higher the pressure situation, the calmer and colder I am [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3841.94s)]
*  and making tough decisions because you need to keep your head in the game until the game is over [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3848.74s)]
*  and then you could deal with your own personal emotions. With Treehill, over time it's evolved [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3856.1s)]
*  because I can sit there and I can talk to CEOs and chairman and say, I sat in that seat. I sat in [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3861.62s)]
*  the seat where we had, you know, $10,000 left in the account as a CEO. I sat in that seat where I [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3867.7s)]
*  realized that, you know, our information was being leaked to a competitor. So as you've gone on in [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3874.18s)]
*  the game, as one has gone on in the game, a lot of times it's easier to talk to someone as a peer [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3880.34s)]
*  as opposed to kind of sitting there, you know, on a bit of a pedestal and saying, well, it's kind [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3888.1000000000004s)]
*  of obvious this is going to happen because it's never obvious in the moment. So that's one way we [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3892.02s)]
*  do it. Second is in the moment where things are difficult and we've been in very difficult [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3896.82s)]
*  situations with Bayer, for example, we've been in difficult situations with Novartis. So it doesn't [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3902.5s)]
*  have to be small companies and you turn up and you get on the flight and you go and sit with people [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3906.74s)]
*  and you walk through a situation in this Altana in 2005 where there were there, you know, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3913.7s)]
*  studies read out the wrong way. Get on the next flight, go and sit with people, have dinner with [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3919.62s)]
*  them and say, what just happened and how do we work through this together? And you roll your sleeve up [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3925.3799999999997s)]
*  and very quickly the emotion dissipates and people start finding a way to look at solutions [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3931.54s)]
*  as opposed to a way that people are looking to blame. Now people, and this is a bit of a [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3939.46s)]
*  using a medical analogy of some of passing, people either go down a healthy morning process [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3947.3799999999997s)]
*  and the morning at death, for example, or morning a negative event, or people get arrested [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3953.06s)]
*  morning and they just need to blame and they'll blame management or the management blame board [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3961.22s)]
*  and then they blame us and then they blame the molecule, then they blame, you know, the trial [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3966.3399999999997s)]
*  center, et cetera. And hopefully you can get someone over that hump. And but sometimes people [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3971.3799999999997s)]
*  get into that arrested morning and they can't end, they can't get out of that loop and they will [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3978.98s)]
*  destroy the situation. And when you get into that negative situation, you just, you just need to [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3987.62s)]
*  walk away and say, look, this is one you need to just close shop, not because you can't get out of [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3992.58s)]
*  it, but your dynamic isn't allowing you to get out of it where emotions take place. And, and what we [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=3997.7s)]
*  do at Tree Hill is, and I'll use a police analogy for this. If you look at frontline police officers [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4004.5s)]
*  and the study showed that they should really be online at frontline for about nine months, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4014.18s)]
*  then they go need to sit in an office for six or 12 months to, to, to re-sensitize and be able to [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4019.14s)]
*  kind of, you know, kind of normalize and then they go to the frontline again. But we see, you know, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4024.5s)]
*  we see, I see a lot of kind of police officers come to, to, to the emergency room, for example, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4029.3799999999997s)]
*  and they'd be on, on in the frontline for 10 to 20 years and you get burnout from that. So from our [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4036.5s)]
*  perspective, what we have is a team where if I start getting emotionally involved, Max steps in, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4041.38s)]
*  if Max starts getting emotionally involved, I step back in, Damien steps in, for example, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4048.1800000000003s)]
*  if you start more biotech restructuring than anyone I've ever met. So we have a team where [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4052.98s)]
*  every single person is, is being chosen by us as a group, because everybody has an independent [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4059.1400000000003s)]
*  voice. And if I'm stepping out of line or I'm getting emotional, there is no one in the team [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4066.82s)]
*  that will hesitate for a second to pull me back. So you have a team that helps mean reversion as a, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4072.6600000000003s)]
*  as opposed to a team that kind of cheers each other on and you become emotional. So a lot of [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4079.54s)]
*  times Trigga will be seen as the non-emotional team, but we're not, we're emotional within it. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4085.3s)]
*  But by the time that people see a surface tension, so, you know, we had a company that had a market [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4092.1800000000003s)]
*  cap of 7 billion, lost about 60% of the share price. And, you know, we went back within 24 hours [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4096.66s)]
*  and said, this is what we think you need to, these are the speech points for your, you know, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4105.139999999999s)]
*  we've gone through your investor date. We've gone through why shareholders have responded the way [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4108.9s)]
*  they have. We understand why your share price reacted. And we think this, these are the 10 [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4114.42s)]
*  things that you need to do. We could be on the next flight in within 24 hours and walk down each [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4120.66s)]
*  of those pathways within a week we're appointed. And the company said, you know, this is highly [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4126.18s)]
*  effective and efficient and you guys aren't emotionally attached to it. And the answer is [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4133.06s)]
*  we were actually emotionally attached. But because we've done it so long, you know, you could be [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4137.700000000001s)]
*  nervous on the flight, you could be on the other side of the flight, they're on the flight back. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4144.1s)]
*  But when you're in front of the board or shareholders, very much like in a surgical [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4147.38s)]
*  theatre, you need to be the cold blooded person in that room to be able to be effective. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4151.86s)]
*  The minute you get emotional, it's difficult. Now on the human side of things, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4160.0199999999995s)]
*  some of the restructuring has been very difficult because not all human beings can [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4167.0599999999995s)]
*  acknowledge that they failed. So what they do is as you step into hell, it's like, it's like [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4173.139999999999s)]
*  using a drowning analogy, you throw the life, you know, ring to them. And all of a sudden, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4178.74s)]
*  you're the reason why they can't swim. So you do over the past 10 years, find certain individuals [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4186.74s)]
*  who come for you. And they make it incredibly personal that you are the reason why they got [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4192.74s)]
*  themselves into a position they're in. And those are the ones which are the hardest ones to deal [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4198.099999999999s)]
*  with. And that's driven by human beings, nothing to do with the programs. You want to name names? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4201.7s)]
*  Yeah. No, I was just kidding. I don't want you to name names either. I got a lot of friends out [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4209.139999999999s)]
*  there. All right. One last one for you. I'm going to ask you to practice what you preach a little [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4213.86s)]
*  bit. You know, you talk about having foresight, looking beyond nodes and looking down the road, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4219.139999999999s)]
*  beginning with the end in mind, as we like to say. So what's next? What's the next node and [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4223.0599999999995s)]
*  maybe a few nodes down the road for Treehill and for you personally? Critical trial disclosure. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4228.9s)]
*  Topic I knew nothing about. And the latest aha in my life is the clinical trial disclosure. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4238.98s)]
*  I was invited to talk at a clinical trial disclosure meeting to give my perspectives on it. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4246.099999999999s)]
*  Took me a month and I couldn't develop any single slides on it because I just assumed that people [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4252.5s)]
*  disclose. But what I've learned is only about 11% of ISDs actually publish the data they publish, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4256.34s)]
*  they generate. Negative data is already published. And there is regulatory framework around [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4266.66s)]
*  why you need to publish data. But actually it's not desperately enforced. So companies at the [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4277.299999999999s)]
*  moment is a bit of a wild west. So why is that relevant? It's relevant because all of the [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4283.62s)]
*  information that we're using and advising our clients is based on about 10 to 15% of the [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4288.66s)]
*  data is out there. If all of these studies that have been run, genuinely publish their data, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4295.86s)]
*  as we're advising our clients on what study to do, which indication to choose, which patients [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4304.26s)]
*  are population we should go for. We would be in a far better position. If there was a far more [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4310.18s)]
*  robust clinical trial disclosure process than there is at the moment. So when I'm talking about [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4316.74s)]
*  making mistakes, Ali can look at the world through my lens and I can look at the world and say, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4322.179999999999s)]
*  look, we've turned around 100 companies. If I didn't realize that actually I'm only helping [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4327.78s)]
*  1% of the fraction, our advice could be significantly better if we had more data. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4334.099999999999s)]
*  And as we're moving into a world where we're talking about AI, et cetera, well, what does AI [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4339.78s)]
*  pick up? The 11% of ISTs, as an example, obviously not all trials of ISTs that are published. Well, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4344.9800000000005s)]
*  what if we forced or enforced publication? And why am I passionate about it? I'm passionate about it [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4351.54s)]
*  because when patients make an active decision to be recruited to a study, they're either on placebo, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4359.22s)]
*  they're on experimental treatment, or they're on some sort of therapy. But they're putting their [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4368.02s)]
*  lives on the line for the betterment of science. Don't we owe them the respect that we then publish [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4373.62s)]
*  the data that comes out of it? So the next person who goes into a study isn't being subject to a [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4383.62s)]
*  treatment that we could have known that shouldn't have been run or a satisfaction that we know that [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4391.7s)]
*  in that indication shouldn't have worked. I think that industry at the moment, I go as far as being [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4396.74s)]
*  saying we're quite blase about the fact that we're fortunate that human beings, when they're ill, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4402.9s)]
*  are subjecting themselves to clinical studies. And the least we could do is have a mechanism by which [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4410.42s)]
*  that data is then published. Yeah. Published and then accessible and usable. You open up a whole [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4417.86s)]
*  new conversation for me now, which we don't have time to do today. But for the benefit of our [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4427.94s)]
*  listeners, last week's episode, I had a lengthy conversation with Hillary Eaton. She's the [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4433.7s)]
*  Chief Business Officer at our company called ProFluent. And we had a lengthy discussion about [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4438.5s)]
*  the fact that negative data, she is an AI company. And we had a lengthy discussion about the fact that [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4442.339999999999s)]
*  negative data is a giant blind spot in the efficacy and go forward plan of artificial [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4449.0599999999995s)]
*  intelligence and machine learning and generative AI in general, particularly in biotech and pharma. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4454.26s)]
*  Agreed. And I think, so when you're saying what's next, so first thing that we've done is, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4462.74s)]
*  the latest thing is the CDO model, which is the Optimized Equivalent Study and rolling that out. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4469.06s)]
*  And that's being embraced by a lot of the CROs and actually a lot of companies. And we're seeing good [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4474.1s)]
*  results from that. I think over the next 12 months is to focus on how do we make clinical trial [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4479.06s)]
*  recruitment far more patient centric. And so we talk about patient centricity, then I think data [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4485.700000000001s)]
*  disclosure is a very easily fixable position or situation. And I feel ashamed that I've been [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4493.3s)]
*  in the banking industry for 20 years, and I've only just learned this aha moment. But I guess [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4504.42s)]
*  that's what it's all about, that you stumble upon these aha moments and think, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4511.14s)]
*  wow, that was a blind spot for me. Is it a blind spot for other people? And I think that is the [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4516.1s)]
*  next blind spot that we can address. Yeah. Well, I've got a lot of questions for you about how [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4521.38s)]
*  to address that, that we simply don't have time to answer right now. So I'm going to, as I [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4527.54s)]
*  often do, and I'm like really in the throes of the conversation and intrigued, but I'm out of time, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4533.3s)]
*  I'm going to ask you to come back on sometime. So I'll get with your people. I'll get with your [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4537.38s)]
*  people. We'll extrapolate that. Because I mean, for one, that sounds like that undertaking sounds [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4540.9800000000005s)]
*  like it's not like a tree hill to client undertaking. This is an industry-wide challenge. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4545.78s)]
*  I can see your wheels turning and you want to respond. We don't have time. We'll talk about [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4554.74s)]
*  it again next time. But in the meantime, this has been super enlightening, a lot of insight [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4557.94s)]
*  in every response that you gave me and fun. I've enjoyed the conversation. I've learned a lot and [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4563.299999999999s)]

*  if you have me on, I'll try and smile more often. No, I was, I was, we're good. We're good. Like I [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4574.099999999999s)]
*  said, I'm proud of myself. So great smile, by the way, fantastic smile. So that's tree hill partners. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF3jtSWxvTg&t=4580.179999999999s)]
