# Epigenomic Programming With Omega Therapeutics' Mahesh Karande
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [September 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU)
*  I met Mahesh Karande a few months ago at the ISPE Biotech Conference in Boston, and he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=0.0s)]
*  didn't have to tell me he was an engineer by training. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=9.36s)]
*  I would have guessed it within the first few minutes of our conversation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  He's curious, and when he sees a problem, he's dissatisfied until a solution is underway. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller, and on today's episode of the Business of Biotech, we're talking with [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=22.12s)]
*  how engineering led him to McKinsey, Pfizer, Novartis, and a few other life sciences stops [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=26.08s)]
*  along the way to his current position as president and CEO at Omega Therapeutics. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=32.08s)]
*  We're also going to talk about one of the dissatisfactions that drives him, the limited [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=38.24s)]
*  toolbox of therapeutics available to address genetic dysregulation, the mRNA engineering [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=42.32s)]
*  work that Omega is doing to change that, and how advanced computational biology and machine [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=48.08s)]
*  learning tools are aiding in that work. Mahesh, it's great to see you again, and thanks for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=53.28s)]
*  taking the time to join me. Great to see you as well, Matt, and thanks a lot for having me on this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=58.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's my pleasure. It's my pleasure. So as I alluded to here from the outset, you're [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=64.16s)]
*  an engineering guy by training. I know that you earned your master's in engineering at Georgia Tech. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=70.08s)]
*  You earned your MBA in finance at Wharton, and you combine a master's in engineering and an MBA in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=76.0s)]
*  finance, and you can take that in any number of directions in any number of industries. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=82.96s)]
*  What, and you did explore a few of those, I guess, before and during your time at McKinsey, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  but what ultimately kind of persuaded you to take those, that combination of trainings and kind of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=96.08s)]
*  move into life sciences with them? So look, I mean, I think engineering, you know, like you said [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  earlier, right, is a high science discipline. You know, I think while I was going through it, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=109.92s)]
*  I didn't realize it, but you know, it really taught me to think critically, analytically, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  you know, there's always a question about whether you learn to be curious or you're curious, and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=120.8s)]
*  that's why you actually do that. So my engineering journey started in a very interesting way, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=126.88s)]
*  Growing up in India, you know, I come from a family of doctors, both my sister the doctors, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=131.6s)]
*  my dad was a pharmaceutical executive. So, you know, generationally, my family has been [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=137.04s)]
*  in the medical business as doctors. So I kind of fell into engineering as the youngest of three [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=143.6s)]
*  kids and decided that, hey, you know what, my older sisters are studying medicine, I want to study [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=151.12s)]
*  engineering. And then I came to eventually to Georgia Tech to pursue, you know, a PhD in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  engineering. And I decided that I really didn't want to do that. So got a master's and then I, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=162.88s)]
*  you know, worked a little bit in engineering and thought about what I wanted to do. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=169.04s)]
*  And then I decided to get an MBA and loved the fact that I got into Wharton and I went there for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  a couple of years. And, you know, as I was graduating with my MBA, you know, one of the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=179.28s)]
*  things that struck me as I was looking across the different spectra of opportunities open to MBAs [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=185.92s)]
*  at that time, you know, I was fortunate to get a position with McKinsey and what that sort of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=191.76s)]
*  allowed me to do is really extend my education by a few years. It was, you know, a generalist [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=199.76s)]
*  strategy consulting job. And, you know, by virtue of being in New Jersey, and by virtue of being an [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=208.16s)]
*  engineer, I automatically worked in telecom and technology on the one hand, and New Jersey, you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=213.76s)]
*  cannot escape pharma, right? So I kind of worked in, you know, devices, pharmaceuticals, telecom, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=219.92s)]
*  and technology. And as I was working through all of that, one of the things that I guess it's sort of, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=227.92s)]
*  you know, the familiarity with the pharmaceutical and the medical world that struck me and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=235.76s)]
*  struck me as a very innovative industry, right? That pharmaceuticals and, you know, in general, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=240.0s)]
*  biotech is so was telecom and technology. But what I loved about pharmaceuticals is, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=246.24s)]
*  you know, as long and this is when I was very young, so, you know, I could tell you that I [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=253.84s)]
*  was thinking about patients and patient centricity, and all of that stuff that sort of developed over [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=258.64s)]
*  the years, right? At that point, very simply, I love the innovation that was happening in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=264.4s)]
*  pharmaceuticals. And I also realized that as long as humanity is alive, you're going to need [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=270.24s)]
*  medicines. And this is just going to get better and better. And I realized that that's the industry [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=275.6s)]
*  that I would love to be associated with. And that's really how I decided to get into pharmaceuticals. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, once I decided to leave McKinsey, and that kind of took me along the road of, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=287.6s)]
*  you know, Pfizer, and then eventually Novartis, where I spent most of my time in the pharmaceutical [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  industry and grew up at Novartis. Yeah. Was your dad pleased or relieved that you [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=297.92s)]
*  in a way sort of followed in his footsteps, went into life sciences and medicine? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=305.6s)]
*  I'm sure he was. He never voiced it to me. But you know, the funny thing is my sister, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=310.56s)]
*  who's a doctor, you know, she's a surgeon, she lives in England, and she called me and said, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=315.36s)]
*  how come you're actually entering the pharmaceutical industry? I mean, for her, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=322.48s)]
*  it was a bizarre thing. As an engineer and MBA, I was entering pharmaceuticals. So, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  yeah, it was a little bit of curiosity from my family. But obviously, you know, look, I mean, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=330.0s)]
*  I think my parents have always sort of had brought us up to do whatever we wanted to do. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=333.92s)]
*  So I think they were all totally fine. And I'm sure my dad was a little bit pleased that I followed [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=339.44s)]
*  his footsteps. Yeah. Well, it's funny, you know, I've had conversations with folks who are now [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=344.16s)]
*  leading life sciences companies who have engineering backgrounds. And I'm always interested in sort of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=350.56s)]
*  what, you know, what caused those shifts in the gears. But they're not, you know, it's not too [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=354.88s)]
*  big a stretch. And in fact, it's sort of inspiring to me to talk to guys like you who have that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=361.68s)]
*  engineering background and have leveraged that problem solving curiosity to go where you feel [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=367.36s)]
*  compelled and inspired to go. My son, who's got a far more engineering oriented mind than I do, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm not a very linear thinker. My son's been, you know, organizing things since he was in diapers. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=382.32s)]
*  And he is, he's at the point now where he's applying to colleges, he's deciding what he's [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  going to study, you know, he's going on 18. And he's thinking engineering. And I'm constantly [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=391.92s)]
*  using examples like yours, Mahesh, to inspire him to think about where engineering can take you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=398.96s)]
*  You know, it's not like, well, once I commit, I'm going to be in mechanical or in, you know, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=405.36s)]
*  architectural. Like, you go get that degree, you learn those foundational elements, and you can [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=410.56s)]
*  kind of take that in a whole lot of different directions. And maybe that's science. Like in [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=417.68s)]
*  your case, what have you sort of learned or observed as far as parallels are concerned from, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=422.4s)]
*  you know, where you were trained formally and how you're applying that training now in a [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=429.04s)]
*  bio-pharmaceutical space? Yeah, look, I mean, that's, you know, you said it right, right? I mean, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=435.6s)]
*  I think engineering, generally speaking, is such a versatile degree. I think it's about the attributes [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=440.32000000000005s)]
*  that, you know, like problem solving, critical thinking, curiosity, right? Look, in my case, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  I also believe that, you know, the distinction between, you know, engineering and science and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=455.44s)]
*  mathematics is sometimes unnecessarily too stark. These are all exceptionally scientific areas, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=464.64s)]
*  right? I think the core of it is people who are in these fields have a very scientific mind. And [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=472.0s)]
*  I think, you know, barring sort of very, very specific content knowledge, the thinking is [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=478.64s)]
*  fungible across all of these areas. And that's what I believe. And I've seen many, many examples of, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=485.68s)]
*  you know, engineers who were running companies and running, you know, funds, etc. in the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=490.96s)]
*  bio-pharmaceutical space. So I'm not unique from any perspective. But look, I think when I think [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=496.32s)]
*  about what I'm doing today, and how, you know, over time, you know, the field has evolved, if you [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=502.08s)]
*  think about what is happening in Cambridge, and as you think about the newer technologies and newer [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=509.44s)]
*  platform, like Omega's platform, which is an epigenomic programming platform, and we are [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=516.48s)]
*  engineering programmable epigenetic medicines. I mean, think about the words I'm using, engineering, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=522.0s)]
*  programming. It's a real confluence of different sciences and engineering and biology are colliding [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=529.28s)]
*  right now. I think, as you think about the future, right? Engineering and biology, really together [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=536.24s)]
*  hold the keys to all of the new technologies and the new platforms that are coming out of [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=543.44s)]
*  bio-pharm, right? So to me, you know, it's a natural sort of evolution, you know, for a person [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=549.5200000000001s)]
*  who understands sciences, loves biology, but has an engineering background that you actually are [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=557.36s)]
*  able to work in. So you can think about what we are doing, you know, as Omega, right? We are really, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=562.6400000000001s)]
*  you know, finding, we are creating bespoke drugs that we call epigenomic controllers, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=568.72s)]
*  that actually control the epigenome, right? And really, what we are doing is we are replicating [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=575.76s)]
*  nature's sort of operating system that nature uses to control gene expression, as well as cellular [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=583.28s)]
*  programming, right? And the medicines that we are creating, this is the first systematic approach [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=592.24s)]
*  to use mRNA therapeutics, right? As programmable epigenetic medicines. And what we are doing is, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=598.16s)]
*  we are literally engineering in, you know, attributes of this drug in terms of specificity [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=605.44s)]
*  of targeting, in terms of durability of action, and in terms of tunability. So we are literally [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=614.8s)]
*  providing these solutions, you know, as engineering solutions to create [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=620.32s)]
*  biopharmaceutical products, right? That's really what we're doing. So to me, I think the lines are [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=627.7600000000001s)]
*  very blurred. And I think, you know, somebody who understands engineering, biology, even mathematics, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=632.48s)]
*  if you talked about computation, having that mindset where you really understand computation, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=639.36s)]
*  you understand mathematics, you understand, you know, that leads you to AI and ML, right? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=645.28s)]
*  Those are the skill sets for the future. And I think that's what you're seeing more and more [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=651.6s)]
*  in biotech. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna save that little segment of this conversation and show it to my son [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=654.9599999999999s)]
*  to inspire him. And, you know, the computational part, we're gonna get into that. I've got some [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=660.8s)]
*  questions for you on computational biology and how Omega is using it. I wrote a short piece just [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  kind of just a couple weeks ago, kind of positing on the fact that like now is the time for [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=671.76s)]
*  computational biology, especially as it relates to it's leveraging in a new and emerging biopharma [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=675.84s)]
*  capacity where, you know, money's been tight, time's been tight, like, we need we need tools [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=681.36s)]
*  to sort of expedite and make things more efficient. And boy did it receive quite a bit of feedback. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=686.88s)]
*  I've had a lot of companies coming at me, especially on the vendor and supplier side, there's a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=691.92s)]
*  burgeoning market of software providers who are eager to bring AI and machine learning tools to [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=695.76s)]
*  life sciences and biopharma in particular. So just a heads up, you know, there'll be some sales [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=702.96s)]
*  pitches coming, I'm sure. But before we get into that, you know, you I want to kind of get my mind [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=707.92s)]
*  around what led you from companies like Pfizer and Novartis, where you had some pretty, you know, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=714.16s)]
*  some pretty sound responsibility and nice positions in those companies. What inspired you to [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=721.04s)]
*  walk away from that and lead an early stage kind of pioneering company? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=727.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good question. So look, I think it's a really good question. I've often [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  asked that question and had a guy that, you know, the responses is often like, yeah, you know, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=739.28s)]
*  I did have it pretty good. And now look at me. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  See, you know, for me, what happened with me is that, you know, as I grew up at Novartis, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=747.92s)]
*  right, one of the things that I did was I put up my hand and went international, right. So I actually [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=756.7199999999999s)]
*  went to Switzerland, which is sort of the headquarters of Novartis, right. It's a Swiss [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=764.7199999999999s)]
*  company. And, you know, this was in 2010. And if you remember at that time, emerging markets were [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=769.28s)]
*  really coming out as sort of the next frontier for pretty much every industry, but [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=778.0799999999999s)]
*  pharmaceuticals, especially. And I got an opportunity to go to Switzerland and work in, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=783.76s)]
*  you know, the pharmaceutical divisions, emerging markets division, which was, you know, the region [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  that covered everything from Africa to Australia, you think about like 96 countries. And I went there [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=794.64s)]
*  as the head of strategy and business development, you know, taking a detour out of, you know, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  marketing and franchises that I was running already in the US. And as I went there, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=804.88s)]
*  what I realized is that these are really, you know, fast moving markets. You know, there's a [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=812.24s)]
*  tremendous amount of opportunity. There's a tremendous amount of patient need. And patients [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=817.52s)]
*  don't have access to medicines, right. So as we work through the emerging markets and created what [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=822.4s)]
*  we call transformational growth plans, and, you know, send these markets on significant [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=828.96s)]
*  growth trajectories, what I realized is that, you know, pharmaceutical business, right, in [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=834.96s)]
*  developed countries can be very stale. And the reason that it's stale is because there is, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=843.12s)]
*  there are very, very clear, you know, sort of pathways, you know, workflows, everything. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=849.44s)]
*  There's a lot of discipline, right, which has been engendered over several years. And these [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=858.16s)]
*  companies work, you know, very smoothly like clockwork, you can take a person out, and keep [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=863.8399999999999s)]
*  that person out for a couple of months and plug that person back in and very little would have [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  changed. Right. So when I was in these fast moving markets, so when I, for example, ran, you know, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  Egypt, and then I took charge of all of Africa, right. I mean, these were markets that were like [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=880.0799999999999s)]
*  startups, right. You know, we introduced the first specialty medicines in Egypt, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=886.24s)]
*  Novartis, Lucentis, and Jelani. These didn't exist. These were mass market country, right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=892.0s)]
*  Specialty, you know, working with the Egyptian government to even come up with pricing, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=898.0s)]
*  drug distribution, access. These were esoteric problems that nobody had solved that we were [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=903.52s)]
*  able to solve. And this went across all emerging markets. And then when I went to Africa, you know, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=910.48s)]
*  it was really a complete reset of the business in terms of developing the pharmaceutical, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=916.16s)]
*  the general medicines and oncology business across all of Africa. And, you know, working [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  with countries where sometimes they don't have money to pay for drugs, but you obviously need to, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=928.4s)]
*  you know, provide drugs because people are otherwise going to die. It sort of creates [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=933.52s)]
*  a whole different mindset, right, of agility, of problem solving, fast moving, you know, access to [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=937.6s)]
*  Boos and Sheikha. For example, as head of Africa, I had access to pretty much most of the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=948.5600000000001s)]
*  ministries of health and people who are willing to work with you as a pharmaceutical executive, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=954.48s)]
*  as you are bringing meaningful solutions to their countries, right. You know, as an opportunity, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=959.52s)]
*  imagine being there and getting an opportunity to work, you know, with the World Economic Forum [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=967.3599999999999s)]
*  and sort of really being able to do something like creating Novartis's first access program [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=976.24s)]
*  that we launched in Kenya, which was, you know, 16 products at a dollar per month for patients, right. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=982.3199999999999s)]
*  When you get to do these kinds of very entrepreneurial skills, and, you know, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=992.16s)]
*  the question always is like, are you an entrepreneur? Do you become an entrepreneur? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=995.76s)]
*  I believe that somebody like me who sort of professionally grew up in America, that I even [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=998.96s)]
*  took the leap to go to Switzerland and then went to Egypt and then Africa and actually moved my [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1003.68s)]
*  family, right. My kids were six and three when we went there. When we came back, you know, seven [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1008.16s)]
*  years later, right, they were, you know, much older and ready to come back into middle high school and [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1013.6s)]
*  middle school. But spending all that time really spurred the entrepreneur in me. And when I came [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1019.52s)]
*  back to America, I had a great job. I was, you know, heading up a solid tumors franchise in America. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1024.88s)]
*  I was on the US leadership team for the Vartis oncology. It was great. But what I realized is [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1030.0s)]
*  that I was missing that action. I could have taken myself out of my role for a couple of months, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1035.6000000000001s)]
*  come back and nothing would have changed because like I said, it was a very well-oiled machine, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1041.2s)]
*  you know, everything was working really well. And I was providing leadership. So, you know, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1045.0400000000002s)]
*  my role was not insignificant. But from a day-to-day operational standpoint, there was already a [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1049.2s)]
*  machine room. And that is the piece that I started missing. And I started feeling a little bit [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1054.96s)]
*  ossified. That's where I actually, you know, spoke to a bunch of people, you know, some of my mentors, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1059.92s)]
*  etc., about the biotech industry. And that's kind of when I made the transition eventually. And I [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1066.0s)]
*  eventually came into Omega. And I can get into that story as to why I came to Omega. But, you know, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  this is where you are able to really exercise. We talked about the curiosity, the scientific [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1076.16s)]
*  mind, trying to find scientific solutions, trying to find engineering solutions, trying to find, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1083.28s)]
*  you know, talk about partnering, how do you actually expand the platform, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1089.92s)]
*  which is actually such a powerful platform in our case. These things keep me on my toes and, you [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1097.28s)]
*  know, keep me very, very interested and curious and keep me going. And that's one of the big [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1103.12s)]
*  reasons I made the transition. Sure. Yeah. Even politics. I mean, your experiences there in Egypt [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1108.2399999999998s)]
*  and Africa and developing nations, you know, working with politicians to make things happen [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1113.28s)]
*  anymore. I mean, that's even here in the States. There's, you know, the ties that bind pharma and [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1117.52s)]
*  bio-pharma to what's going on in Washington only get stronger. So I'm sure a lot of that helped. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1123.12s)]
*  I'm sure you, you know, I think you've shared with me some harrowing experiences from Egypt and [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1129.28s)]
*  Africa when we last spoke. And I'm sure a lot of that is shaped in a lot of ways your [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1133.28s)]
*  worldview as a bio-pharma leader and problem solver. Yeah. No, it does. Definitely. I mean, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1138.64s)]
*  I think, look, you know, on hindsight, I mean, it's experience that I would never change. Right. But [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1144.24s)]
*  I think when you're going through it, I mean, imagine now a young family of, you know, my kids [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1153.36s)]
*  were about six and nine. We land in Egypt and within a month and a half, the second coup, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  the coup happens, the Morrissey government fell in the country, erupts into complete chaos. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1168.0s)]
*  And, you know, as the president of Novartis for Egypt, essentially, everything starts reporting [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1173.6s)]
*  me. Right. And I'm responsible for the safety. And, you know, it's funny, I, what I realized is that [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1180.72s)]
*  while Novartis is a tremendous company with tremendous resources, a lot of these actions [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1186.48s)]
*  have to happen at local level because there's nobody in headquarters who really understands [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1191.68s)]
*  what is happening locally. They can give you moral support, but you as the leader really have to [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1195.52s)]
*  provide the solution at the local level. And, you know, my team obviously rallied around me. And [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1201.92s)]
*  what I realized is there was no playbook to deal with, you know, a existential crisis like a coup [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1207.76s)]
*  where, you know, they would be essentially gunshots fired, not too far from anywhere. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1215.92s)]
*  You know, I remember once my kids and my wife got stuck in a huge rally, right. And I was on [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1223.04s)]
*  the phone with them for an hour and a half, you know, talking to them all the while. Right. I [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1228.96s)]
*  think these kinds of existential crisis where you don't really have a playbook, but how do you then [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1234.48s)]
*  actually deal with it? You know, it's the old adage, right? When the going gets tough, the tough [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1238.88s)]
*  gets going. And that's what my team did. And I, you know, you see a whole different level of [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1243.3600000000001s)]
*  capabilities that come out of people if you create the space. And I feel fortunate that I was able to [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1249.44s)]
*  create the space and I had a great team that then rallied. Right. And, you know, look, I mean, I think [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1254.48s)]
*  through this experience in Egypt, you know, the virus, you know, we meant I actually beat my [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1260.08s)]
*  numbers by six percent points in 2013. And we emerged as the number two pharmaceutical company [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1266.56s)]
*  only behind Glaxo, which is within Egypt for years, you know, like from colonial days, right. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1274.32s)]
*  Yeah, we emerged, we are the only company that gained market share. And actually, I beat my [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1279.84s)]
*  numbers. And that was because of my incredible team rally. But you learn so many leadership [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1285.28s)]
*  lessons. You learn so many lessons when you're in an existential crisis that, you know, look, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1290.16s)]
*  you can apply to biotech, but fortunately, I don't have those existential crisis. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1296.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, you can, you have the luxury now of facing challenges and problems [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1300.56s)]
*  and having that hindsight to say like, yes, we do as Omega today, we face some challenges. We've [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1308.0s)]
*  got scientific challenges, clinical challenges, you know, funding challenges, challenges that any [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1313.44s)]
*  biopharma leader faces. But you're not being fired upon during a coup. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1318.96s)]
*  Exactly. Or in Africa, right. When I took over, like literally as I was taking Africa over, Ebola [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1323.76s)]
*  emerged. An entire Western Africa. For me, as a leader of, you know, the of Africa, I had to [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1332.24s)]
*  keep my reps safe. We were getting reports that reps were being exposed to Ebola, right? That [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1338.08s)]
*  itself is such a harrowing experience, because this is your team. And you want to make sure people, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1344.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, this is not a war zone, knowingly that, you know, you're going into [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1350.24s)]
*  existential crises and dangers, right? This is supposed to be a blue collar, let's say a white [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1355.6799999999998s)]
*  collar, really, the professional job, where they're not expected to contract a disease and die. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1361.12s)]
*  I mean, I think these are the things that, you know, sort of when you deal with, you know, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1367.1200000000001s)]
*  it brings out a certain level of, I would say, you know, innovation, leadership, agility, you know, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  ability to think through things, you know, keeping a cool mind, right? I think these things get sharp. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1379.6000000000001s)]
*  Look, intrinsically, a lot of people have quality, right? But whether those qualities actually get [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1384.5600000000002s)]
*  tested or not depends on the circumstances you're in. I feel fortunate that I happened to be in [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1391.6s)]
*  circumstances where some of those qualities got tested. And, you know, fortunately for me, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1396.48s)]
*  because of a great team, great environment that, you know, we have created together, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1403.04s)]
*  that I came out of it actually stronger, right? So, you know, and then when I bring it to, like [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1407.6799999999998s)]
*  you said, bring it back to biotech, right? I mean, look, I think, you know, you can strip away, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1413.1999999999998s)]
*  right? The exact crises of the situations. And if you just think about sort of, you know, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1419.36s)]
*  the attributes or the agility, the learning agility, for example, right? Are you able to sort [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1426.08s)]
*  of deal with change? Are you able to, you know, deliver results in stressful situations? Are you [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1431.6799999999998s)]
*  able to relate to people? Are you able to sort of, you know, still, you know, keep your faculties [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1438.08s)]
*  and sort of exercise, you know, your, you know, abilities and brain or, you know, what have you, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1445.6s)]
*  right? Are you able to do that? And all that gets tested. That's really if you strip everything else [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1454.56s)]
*  out. Those are the qualities that actually help you as a CEO or a senior leader in our biotech [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1460.0s)]
*  industry. I mean, just think about what has happened in the last year, year and a half, right? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1467.12s)]
*  The industry taken a beating and, you know, you can sit and move and think about, you know, wow, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1471.2s)]
*  the stock is really down. You know, this has happened, that has happened, you know, companies [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1477.04s)]
*  are folding. So many things are happening, right? You know, that's enough for many people to sort of [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1481.6000000000001s)]
*  really go into a shell. But for me, fortunately, I'm sure, look, I'm not unique in this, but at [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1487.1200000000001s)]
*  least, you know, if I just speak about myself, you know, all of these challenges really pay [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1494.96s)]
*  compared to what my team and I had to go through in Egypt and Africa. So it's a matter of perspective. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1500.08s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah, no doubt. You know, Mahesh, when I, when I, when I considered having you on [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1506.16s)]
*  the podcast, inviting you to be on the podcast, one of my greatest concerns is now playing out [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1511.6s)]
*  in real time. We're like a half an hour into the conversation. I haven't even asked you about Omega [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1517.12s)]
*  yet. I think you and I, yeah, I should, you know, I set myself up for this. I know that this may be [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1521.52s)]
*  a two hour conversation. This may be like a three commute listen for our, for our audience [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1525.92s)]
*  for warning. Tell me, we're talking about some of your experiences in Africa right now. Why, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1531.68s)]
*  for those of those of you watching on YouTube or on our website are seeing right now, Mahesh talking [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1537.68s)]
*  with me and there's a painting, a beautiful painting of Nelson Mandela behind Mahesh. Tell me [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1544.0s)]
*  about that painting. What's the inspiration for having that painting hanging in your office? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1550.88s)]
*  Yeah, you know, so, so if you, you know, as I, as I took over as a CEO for Omega, one of the ethos [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1555.04s)]
*  that, you know, I sort of embraced, you know, even as I was along my, you know, in my journeys, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1564.56s)]
*  you know, as a GM in various, various places in the waters, especially working with emerging [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1570.96s)]
*  markets. One of the things that I realized actually as an ethos, which, you know, which, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1577.52s)]
*  which I actually brought to Omega and that is Omega's ethos today is ambitious yet, right? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1584.08s)]
*  You think about it. Now, when you are working in a space that Omega is working in, where we are [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1589.92s)]
*  solving problems, we are taking the first approach to use mRNA therapeutics as programmable [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1595.2s)]
*  epigenetic medicines. It's a completely new class of drugs, never before been attempted, right? And [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1600.0s)]
*  now we are entering the clinic. We got clearance for our first time. To do all of that, you have to [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1606.32s)]
*  have a really burning level of ambition. And look, ambition sometimes has negative connotations, but [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1611.4399999999998s)]
*  what I'm talking about is a desire to really, you know, undertake the pioneering journey and drive [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1618.6399999999999s)]
*  till you get to succeed, right? But alongside that, there has to be a deep sense of humility, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1625.6s)]
*  because, you know, one has to appreciate the fact that, you know, you cannot do this alone. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1632.64s)]
*  There's a whole ecosystem. There's a biotech industry. There are giants who came before us, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1638.96s)]
*  who created some of these technologies that we can then take it to the next level. And you have to [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1643.68s)]
*  have a significant amount of humility to sort of, you know, even appreciate the fact that you're [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1648.8000000000002s)]
*  going to actually use these, you know, get patients to actually use these drugs. I mean, imagine the [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1654.8000000000002s)]
*  contract that you need to have, right? A social contract with patients and, you know, just morally [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1661.92s)]
*  to actually make that happen. So to me, ambitious and humble really captures that very well. And, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1668.96s)]
*  you know, the one, the person who inspired that in a big, big way, right, is Nelson Mandela. If you [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1673.92s)]
*  think about Mandela, he was imprisoned for 27 years on Robins Island, which is literally, if you [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1679.28s)]
*  think about it, not too far from Johannesburg, right? Not too far from mainland, except there's, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1686.48s)]
*  you know, pretty much great white in the water, you know, surrounding it, right? So imagine, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1693.28s)]
*  you're 27 years in this little cell, you don't lose your spirit, right? You still stay true to [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1700.08s)]
*  your cause. And then you come out, right? And you could have gone a despotic way, but you build a [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1707.28s)]
*  rainbow coalition and create a country like South Africa, a true democracy, where everybody works [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1715.04s)]
*  together and thrives, no matter who you are, what your race is, right? Imagine what it takes to be, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1721.52s)]
*  to actually get that done. And the humility that you need to have as a leader to do that, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1729.2s)]
*  Nelson Mandela to me embodied that ambitious rumble. That's why his painting hangs in my office. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1734.24s)]
*  When you're striving to excel in a new arena, the best guides are the ones already doing it well. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1740.72s)]
*  The business of biotech brings those voices forward to help new and emerging biopharmers [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1746.24s)]
*  turn their innovations, like mRNA and cell and gene therapies, into clinical realities. Tune in [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1750.8000000000002s)]
*  and subscribe for insights on hiring, regulatory and other need to know topics for biopharma [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1757.44s)]
*  leaders. The podcast is brought to you in collaboration with Cytiva. Check out their [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1762.48s)]
*  resources at Cytiva.com backslash emerging biotech. That's C-Y-T-I-V-A.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1768.64s)]
*  Now, it's the parallels to, I mean, the parallels to doing business in the biopharma space are many [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1779.68s)]
*  and clear, you know, just as you talk about the length of the struggle, the, you know, the [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1785.52s)]
*  you know, the absolute need for fortitude. It's a tough, I mean, obviously, it falls in comparison [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1791.9199999999998s)]
*  to what Nelson Mandela endured, you know, personally, physically, but the parallels are [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1801.04s)]
*  certainly understood. That's a good segue, by the way. Now we can talk about Omega. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1806.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about Omega. So you explained to me the, you know, sort of the concept [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1812.6399999999999s)]
*  just a few minutes ago, you talked about this idea on being the first to take a systematic approach [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1817.68s)]
*  to using mRNA therapeutics as programmable epigenetic medicines. And then, you know, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1822.64s)]
*  there's another kind of catchphrase or phrase that I think Omega uses around understanding nature's [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1828.8s)]
*  universal operating system. I'm curious, I'm going to try to ask a concise question about that, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1835.04s)]
*  and I'm not sure that I can, because I'm not very concise, but I'll try. So these are big ideas, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1842.16s)]
*  you know, they're big thoughts, they're big ideas, you know, this idea that, you know, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1848.8000000000002s)]
*  we're going to understand nature's universal operating system, and then do something with that [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1852.72s)]
*  to, you know, to have a positive therapeutic effect. How do you winnow that down to a business? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1856.96s)]
*  You know, take that and make a positive therapeutic effect on what and why from a business [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1864.3200000000002s)]
*  perspective. You know, you can't just go out there and say, well, we're going to, you know, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1870.4s)]
*  we're going to apply engineering to mRNA to solve all the world's health problems. You got to winnow [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1874.16s)]
*  that down. So tell me a little bit about that. What's sort of the philosophical basis for [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1879.0400000000002s)]
*  the business aspect of what you're trying to do? Yeah, no, absolutely. So look, I mean, I think, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1883.2800000000002s)]
*  you know, Omega was really founded in 2017 by David Berry and Nubar Faire and, you know, flagship. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1888.24s)]
*  To really look at epigenetics and, you know, epigenetics, as we know, controls everything, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1897.04s)]
*  you know, in the organism's life, right, from cell birth to cell death and everything in between, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1906.48s)]
*  right? And, you know, it's a, it's a mechanism that nature uses to control gene expression. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1912.0s)]
*  And, you know, if you think about the central dogma that genes express, you know, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1918.32s)]
*  the transcription happens, mRNA is created, translation happens, proteins created, and [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1922.16s)]
*  protein is sort of, you know, the fundamental sort of material of life. If you think in those terms, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1931.44s)]
*  right, nature very rarely does anything in ones or twos. When nature is involved, there's usually [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1939.52s)]
*  a very systematic way. That's what we sought to find out, right? And, you know, as the team [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1945.12s)]
*  worked through this, what we realized, and I think there was also a paper, you know, that Rick Young [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1952.9599999999998s)]
*  and his team published in Cell in 2016, which was the basis of the formation of this company, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1957.4399999999998s)]
*  and the two forces met, and Rick, you know, is on a board, you know, so essentially, what we found was [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1963.04s)]
*  that nature has organized genes and the regulatory elements in sort of these [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1969.44s)]
*  conserved three-dimensional structures, we now call them insulated genomic domains, right, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1974.48s)]
*  which act as fundamental regulators of, you know, gene regulation for single or multiple genes, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1979.1200000000001s)]
*  right? Once you know that, right, remember, we were talking about the confluence of engineering [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1985.1200000000001s)]
*  and biology, now you're thinking, well, if I can use these as drug targets, I can control gene [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1990.4s)]
*  expression. And you asked about the underlying philosophy, that is the underlying philosophy [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=1996.72s)]
*  that the Omega team sort of undertook. And then, you know, I joined in 2019, and there was some [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2002.72s)]
*  initial proof. And then as we looked at this, we decided that look, you know, for us to be able to [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2008.8s)]
*  sort of delineate all of these IGDs, this entire genome, right, and sort of understand where genes [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2014.0s)]
*  sit. So there are about, you know, 15,000 IGDs distributed across the 23 chromosomes. If you [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2020.72s)]
*  think about the 200 types of cells, you know, ubiquitously, you know, in the human body, every [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2027.2s)]
*  cell in the human body has, you know, the 23 chromosomes and the exact sort of, you know, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2033.68s)]
*  structure of the IGDs. So you and I have the same, you know, they're conserved within species, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2040.48s)]
*  they're conserved across species. In fact, between non-human primates and humans, conservation [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2045.2s)]
*  is pretty intact. So this is truly nature's operating system. That's why we coined the phrase [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2050.08s)]
*  operating system. And we said, all right, now nature controls it by laying, deleting, modifying [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2055.36s)]
*  epigenetic marks, right? Disease occurs, right? Irrespective of what the cause of disease was, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2061.7599999999998s)]
*  what the etiology was, disease occurs because genes get dysregulated. That's the truism. So if [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2069.2s)]
*  you can bring genes back to normal expression, you should resolve disease right at the pre-transcription [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2076.4s)]
*  level and then everything else should flow properly. So we set on that premise and we prove that premise. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2083.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's why what we have done is we have figured out how we actually control these IGDs [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2089.04s)]
*  and thereby control single or multiple gene expression for the genes that sit in the IGD [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2095.6800000000003s)]
*  because they act as these insulated, you know, units of gene control. And that's where we are [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2100.56s)]
*  using mRNA therapeutics, right? To essentially use the ribosomal machinery to get to the genome. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2105.84s)]
*  And what we are doing is we are basically recreating nature's work of either creating [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2112.96s)]
*  an epigenetic mark or rewriting it or erasing it or modifying it, right? And we are doing that [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2119.04s)]
*  with, you know, our engineered therapeutics, which we call epigenomic controls. That's really what we [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2126.56s)]
*  are doing. And, you know, again, a very systematic way of solving this problem. You know, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2132.0s)]
*  I love to bring in engineering again, right? I mean, that's how you actually think about [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2139.2s)]
*  engineering and programming. We've taken that systematic approach and we have created these [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2144.16s)]
*  modular engineered therapeutics. And, you know, by the way, you know, this is a great segue into your, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2148.96s)]
*  you know, you're thinking about, you know, AI and machine learning. Imagine the amount of data that [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2155.52s)]
*  we have to crank through to figure this out. I can tell you, oh yeah, this IGD and these genes [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2161.84s)]
*  that I correlate to this disease. So now we are going to go into this and within the IGD, we are [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2166.72s)]
*  going to, you know, hit these specific sequences. But this is not something I can sit and do on [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2170.48s)]
*  paper, right? I mean, there's loads and loads of unimaginable data that you have to crank through [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2176.32s)]
*  and use tools and technologies and then actually have your own programs. And that's really what [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2183.44s)]
*  my team has done. Our computational biology team has really done that. And we are able to really [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2189.04s)]
*  crank through those data such that, and this will blow your mind, man, we can, the day we interrogate [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2194.0s)]
*  a particular IGD for a particular disease and we know through known biology that certain genes, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2200.88s)]
*  you know, will correlate to a certain disease, we find which IGD that gene sits in or those genes [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2207.28s)]
*  sit in. And then we understand all the sequences of the regulators in the IGD. From that day to [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2212.32s)]
*  getting to putative medicines or controllers that we can start testing in vitro takes us about [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2219.6800000000003s)]
*  six weeks. Yeah, that's incredible. Imagine, imagine us growing up, right? Where drug discovery has [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2228.48s)]
*  always been in small molecules with a high throughput, you sort of throw a lot of things [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2235.6000000000004s)]
*  against the wall and see if something sticks. We are not doing that. We are taking a completely [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2239.28s)]
*  different approach. We are saying, okay, this is what we need to tackle. What's the best way to [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2243.6800000000003s)]
*  tackle that? And we are literally engineering a solution to that. That allows us to come up with [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2249.1200000000003s)]
*  our omega epigenomic controllers, the DNA binding domains, as well as the effectors, right? And we [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2255.6800000000003s)]
*  put them together and we'll get, I don't know, 10 to 20 constructs, no matter of maybe four to six [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2260.8s)]
*  weeks. And then we can start testing them steadily. So if you think about a MIC program, which is a [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2268.08s)]
*  leading program from scratch, where we first interrogated the MIC IGD to actually submitting [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2272.88s)]
*  the IND to the FDA took us 27 months. And one month later, the IND was clean. 28 months, it took [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2280.48s)]
*  us from scratch to getting a IND cleared by FDA. That's how powerful this platform is. And we have [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2288.4s)]
*  been able to really take this very esoteric science and apply very systematic first principles, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2295.6s)]
*  engineering approach, programmatic approach, use big data, AI, machine learning, our own algorithms [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  and actually speed up this discovery process to getting an IND. To create an environment where [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2310.96s)]
*  you were able to take that approach to leverage an engineering mind and then also apply computational [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2320.16s)]
*  biology skillsets, processes. What did it take in the formative years of omega that makes it look [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2328.96s)]
*  different probably from a traditional, even a traditional ATMP biopharma company that's [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2339.6s)]
*  working on new cutting edge science? I guess it's a general question. I'm looking for some [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2347.52s)]
*  detail on how you created a company from a personnel standpoint, an organizational standpoint, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2352.72s)]
*  a tool standpoint, able to leverage that kind of technology and apply computational biology in a [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2357.6s)]
*  meaningful way. Cause there are a lot of people stubbing their toes and skinning their knees, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2363.2s)]
*  trying this stuff out right now. It doesn't necessarily come easy to a lot of traditional [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2365.92s)]
*  scientists to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence and computational biology. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2374.32s)]
*  So how'd you do it? Are you laughing because you don't want to tell me the secrets, the secret [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2380.0s)]
*  recipe? I'm happy to tell you the secrets. If there is a secret, I'm laughing because I don't [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2388.56s)]
*  know whether there's a secret. I think first and foremost, let's talk about tools and capabilities. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2394.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, if you think about the Boston Cambridge ecosystem, I think you have the aggregation of [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2404.7200000000003s)]
*  smartest people in the world who are dealing with biology and computational and look at the [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2410.6400000000003s)]
*  universities, look at the people, look at the companies. You're some of the smartest people in [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2416.4s)]
*  the world. And there's a tremendous war for talent, but people are able to get the right people. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2420.2400000000002s)]
*  And you said it right. I mean, I think just getting the right people doesn't mean that you're [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2427.76s)]
*  able to actually solve problems. Fundamentally, you have to create an environment where if you're [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2433.68s)]
*  bringing, first of all, you have to bring in the right people. It's not just the skill sets, it's [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2439.6s)]
*  also the attributes. And then you have to create an environment where those people [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2444.8799999999997s)]
*  are able to do what they do best in an unfettered way. And the word culture gets thrown around a [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2452.96s)]
*  lot. So I don't want to talk about particularly, oh, we have a great culture. We do have a good [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2461.92s)]
*  culture. But culture is a living breathing thing that everybody creates. So I told you about the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2466.7200000000003s)]
*  ethos of Omega. So I joined Omega in 2019 April when the company was barely two years old. And then [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2474.16s)]
*  some initial proof of principle. And we had to really set up all these experiments to really get [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2483.28s)]
*  to where we are today. And then I hired my chief scientific officer, who I had known from my [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2488.08s)]
*  previous role and he's a great guy. And one of the things we did is we very early on, within the [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2496.56s)]
*  first six months, delineated our ethos and we created a very clear cogent set of values and [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2502.24s)]
*  behaviors in the entire company of 25 people that worked on. And we all agreed that this is our compact. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2509.04s)]
*  This is our ethos and these are our values and behaviors. And as then we hired people, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2517.52s)]
*  look, hiring people for their technical promises one piece, but there's, I also hire and the team [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2525.2s)]
*  hires for high learning agility. You put that together and you create a culture and you create [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2531.44s)]
*  an environment where people are free to do what they do best. Imagine, we have all been through [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2537.44s)]
*  life and companies and jobs, where we went in and we were hired for something and then we were told, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2543.84s)]
*  well, that's not how we do things. You have to do things this way. What is the point of me hiring [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2550.6400000000003s)]
*  really smart people and then telling them what to do as opposed to them telling me what to do? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2556.56s)]
*  That's the environment that we have created. I mean, simply, so, I don't know whether that's [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2561.28s)]
*  a secret sauce or not, but our team and so we have set a high performance culture [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2568.8s)]
*  with the ambitious yet humble ethos. At the same time, we do not [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2575.6000000000004s)]
*  tolerate deviations from values and behavior. What I mean by do not tolerate, it's not as if [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2583.2000000000003s)]
*  it's a draconian culture. It's a self-selective culture eventually. Eventually, people self-select. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2588.4s)]
*  We are a team of about 120 people now and we have grown the team very judiciously. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2594.64s)]
*  We are one of those biotechs that raised a great C round and did a great IPO and [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2600.7999999999997s)]
*  went berserk and doubled and tripled in size. We are doing this very systematically. We are [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2605.8399999999997s)]
*  using investors money. We are doing this thoughtfully. The team, we have had people [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2610.96s)]
*  who've grown in the organization. So I think, look, you create that whether you call it culture or [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2617.12s)]
*  an ecosystem where people thrive and that's really what we've been able to do. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2623.68s)]
*  And then people do what they do best to solve problems. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2628.16s)]
*  Yeah. I got a couple more questions around computational biology and how you're [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2632.48s)]
*  leveraging that and making that happen. But just on the point that you're making right now around [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2638.4s)]
*  resources and people and culture, have you found it advantageous beyond the obvious financial [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2642.48s)]
*  support and sort of prowess? Has it been advantageous from a personnel standpoint and an [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2653.12s)]
*  access to knowledge and capability standpoint to be a flagship company? Oh, yeah, definitely. I [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2658.24s)]
*  think, look, we are an independent sovereign company from within the flagship universe. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2664.64s)]
*  Look, I think the fact that we have Nubar, who's our chairman, I think he's legendary. We have John [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2673.8399999999997s)]
*  Menline, who was one of the original people who worked on mRNA, etc. and has been a part of many [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2681.44s)]
*  companies. David Berry, who's a prolific creator of companies. And then we have access to really, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2692.56s)]
*  really smart people in flagship. And you think about people like Lucia Rosetti, who is the [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2700.08s)]
*  CMO of flagship that I can pick up the phone and chat with if I really have. So having an [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2707.12s)]
*  ability to actually reach out to very smart people who are willing to actually help you, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2712.7999999999997s)]
*  it's tremendous. I would say that from that standpoint, it has been very helpful. But I [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2717.6s)]
*  mean, I think, look, all of the technology, etc. that we have developed is all homegrown. So it's [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2724.48s)]
*  not that Moderna is an older sibling within the ecosystem that we got some technology from Moderna. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2730.16s)]
*  That is absolutely not the situation of the case. That's why I said, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2737.3599999999997s)]
*  it's an independent sovereign company in that sense. But we have access to the best minds. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2743.7599999999998s)]
*  And look, the ecosystem also, we are as an ecosystem and as a collection of people, we are [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2750.72s)]
*  collectively connected to a lot of other people outside. So if there is somebody super smart, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2759.2s)]
*  who's nowhere nearby, and if I ask somebody at flagship and say, can you connect me to this [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2765.36s)]
*  person? Chances are that they know them. So I think those are the things that tremendously help. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2770.5600000000004s)]
*  On the computational biology subject, one of the problems that I hear frequently, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2777.44s)]
*  or not problems, challenges, right? One of the things that is being addressed, but continually [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2784.48s)]
*  needs to be addressed is data access. There's a ton of it. There's a ton of data. There's a ton [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2790.08s)]
*  of data that's not even digitized, that's inaccessible to computational biology programs. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2798.3199999999997s)]
*  Artificial intelligence can't do anything with it because it's either unstructured or not even [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2802.7999999999997s)]
*  digital. And we're working on that. Everybody's working on that. But where do you start? You guys [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2807.36s)]
*  are sort of on the leading, if not bleeding, edge of this. Where do you start if you don't necessarily [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2812.7999999999997s)]
*  know or have access to the data that you think you need to feed the machine? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2819.52s)]
*  Yeah. Look, that has been the age-old problem of competition. I think garbage in, garbage out. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2825.2s)]
*  Look, I think you have to really think about what exactly we are talking about in the value chain [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2834.64s)]
*  of biopharma. I mean, I think if you think about a lot of AI companies, a lot of [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2843.12s)]
*  computational companies that you talked about, some of these vendors, etc. who reached out to you [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2850.4s)]
*  after your podcast. I mean, I think they rely on third party data that is created either [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2854.56s)]
*  the pharmaceutical company level or payer data or provider data. It really depends on which part [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2861.44s)]
*  of the value chain you're working on. We are not working on right now for Omega on patient data and [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2867.92s)]
*  trying to find what are the biomarkers that we need to work on and those kinds of things that [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2875.92s)]
*  are a lot of companies are doing in development. What we are doing, where we are using computational [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2887.04s)]
*  processes in the area of genomic research where I told you about [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2893.12s)]
*  the entire library of genes and where they sit in IGD. So we have created our own [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2902.0s)]
*  proprietary database of all of these IGDs, all of these sequences, then it keeps going. We have [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2909.6s)]
*  delineated over I would say 95% of the 50,000 IGDs. So we have our own proprietary [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2915.28s)]
*  databases. We know exactly what to target, etc. And we have created those using all the tools [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2921.92s)]
*  available to us and we interrogate those with all the tools available to us. We use obviously [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2927.92s)]
*  tools that are like HiSeq, Chipsseq, etc. as we look at gene expressions and stuff like [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2932.6400000000003s)]
*  that. So that's one piece. Then there are obviously genomic databases that are open, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2940.32s)]
*  that are publicly available. Those are the things that we use. So we haven't run into a problem [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2945.6000000000004s)]
*  from a standpoint of organizing data because we are looking at data very, very prospectively. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2953.84s)]
*  We have created some of these databases. And where you run into these problems that you're [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2960.96s)]
*  talking about is when you're using third party data, and you're trying to figure out patient data [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2965.6s)]
*  or disease data stuff, which is not organized in a way that your algorithm or you need to write [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2971.52s)]
*  algorithms to address the organization of that. That's where a lot of the issues are. We don't [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2978.0s)]
*  face those issues. So what we're doing is think about what we are doing. We are really using [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2984.24s)]
*  computational analysis to identify the IGDs, where we actually act on the IGDs. We use tools [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2988.72s)]
*  to figure out if we act here, in silico, what is the expression that we'll get? And then we design [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=2995.6s)]
*  our controllers, epigenomic controllers to address those things. So in terms of target [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3002.72s)]
*  identification to candidate selection, and some of the preclinical work, that's where we are using [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3009.7599999999998s)]
*  our computational prowess in a heavy way. And a lot of it is homegrown, home created with tools [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3016.56s)]
*  that are available, as well as databases that are publicly available. So we have run into those [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3022.88s)]
*  problems. Yeah, no, it's great because it gives us a perspective on the approach taken by a company [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3027.44s)]
*  that's rooted in science that's applying the technology to that scientific foundation. And [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3035.2000000000003s)]
*  I say that in contrast to, I'm interested in your perspective on this. I've had conversations with [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3043.36s)]
*  more than one company in the past couple of weeks who are developing computational biology [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3048.64s)]
*  platforms, so AI, machine learning tools for drug discovery and development, who began as that. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3056.96s)]
*  But this is super interesting to me. In the process of developing tools to aid in drug discovery and [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3066.0s)]
*  drug development, they decided the best way to illustrate the power of said tools would be to [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3074.0s)]
*  develop their own pipeline to at least make a play, take a stab at developing a candidate [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3079.36s)]
*  and taking it somewhere. I mean, presumably if you start out as an IT company, information services [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3089.2s)]
*  company, you don't necessarily intend to take the thing commercial, but you're going to say, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3095.28s)]
*  hey, we'll take it to a certain point and move forward. More than one company that I've had [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3100.88s)]
*  conversations like this. So I'm curious about that. Like, boy, as information science [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3104.6400000000003s)]
*  gets a foothold in the biopharma space, the blurring of lines maybe that we're seeing around how you [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3114.7200000000003s)]
*  define your company, right? Are you a biopharma? Are you an information services provider? Are [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3122.2400000000002s)]
*  you an information services provider who's just kind of making a showcase candidate to show off [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3126.96s)]
*  what you can do? Do you intend to be a biopharma? What's your take on that? And you see this now? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3131.68s)]
*  That's a very interesting question. And look, I think value chains of different businesses have [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3138.48s)]
*  collided before as well. If I take you back, we started this conversation about when I was at [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3147.44s)]
*  McKinsey in the early 2000s. If you think about what was happening then, this didn't exist. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3154.4s)]
*  But if you think voice and data were colliding, and there were companies that were voice centric [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3163.12s)]
*  phones. And then there were these companies like, I mean, think about Apple today. I mean, it was a [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3170.8s)]
*  software company doing computer. They were not in telephony or anything like that. And think about [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3178.32s)]
*  what has happened over there. Over time, these value chains collided and something that was [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3184.4s)]
*  sort of a merger of the two eventually emerged. And the people who really could get the best value [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3192.0800000000004s)]
*  out of that remained and became big players. That's where now you get companies like Apple, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3200.6400000000003s)]
*  Samsung. Think about the old Blackberries of the world or Nokia phones that used to rule. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3207.7599999999998s)]
*  I think when value chains collide, I think it's a very interesting phenomenon. And there's going to [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3214.3199999999997s)]
*  be some players who will figure this out and some players are not. So now if you think about, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3223.52s)]
*  I can see a technology company that has algorithms, for example, that are able to organize [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3228.9599999999996s)]
*  databases. I'm just making it up. Think about, you take a disease area or a few disease areas, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3238.3999999999996s)]
*  and you basically organize all the small molecule data that have been used in those diseases. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3245.9199999999996s)]
*  And basically, look at patient outcomes, etc. Marry all that together, create a database or [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3254.64s)]
*  a data link, and then sort of write an algorithm, put an algorithm on top of that to sift through [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3261.8399999999997s)]
*  all of that and give you a prediction on how that small molecule should be configured. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3267.6s)]
*  If you're able to do that and then say, well, there could be 10 configurations as opposed to [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3277.84s)]
*  like a thousand configurations that over time chemists have tested in pharmaceutical companies, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3283.84s)]
*  I mean, like the old world. If you come up with 10 formulations and say, well, I'm going to create [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3289.2000000000003s)]
*  these 10 formulations, let me test them. You have a huge leg up. Companies that will be able to do [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3293.52s)]
*  that will actually start defining themselves as the next drug companies. Look, in familiar [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3298.48s)]
*  information, AI, data, this is all, I mean, all of this really is a means to an end. I mean, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3306.8s)]
*  I think the tools will get better and better, computing power will get better and better. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3316.4s)]
*  The databases will get better and better. And how do you leverage that to actually come up with [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3320.1600000000003s)]
*  these drugs is probably the way to go. So I'm waiting and watching to see how this actually [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3326.32s)]
*  turns out. I mean, there are so many companies that started off as these AI companies and have [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3334.0s)]
*  really moved into drug discovery and then even drug development and rapid. So I'm actually like you [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3342.08s)]
*  probably just waiting and seeing how this all plays out. Having said that, what we do is a [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3352.96s)]
*  little bit different because the basis of Omega is not AI and ML. We use AI and ML to basically [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3358.64s)]
*  delineate a very clear biology that is new in terms of our understanding of it as new. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3370.48s)]
*  And we have used these tools as tools to really understand the biology and take that biology and [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3378.72s)]
*  create a drug development platform. So we are using it a little bit differently as opposed to [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3384.72s)]
*  looking at databases of small molecules and the patients and figuring out how to actually [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3389.9199999999996s)]
*  structure that small molecule. I'm just giving an example. It's a pretty short example, but that's [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3397.3599999999997s)]
*  kind of what most companies seem to be doing. Yeah. Now the purist in me likes that. I don't want to [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3402.56s)]
*  see Jeff Bezos taking over the new and emerging biopharma space by applying too much technology. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3408.88s)]
*  By the way, about five minutes ago, you probably had about half of our listeners [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3419.84s)]
*  scratching their heads and scurrying to look up on Wikipedia who Nokia and BlackBerry are. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3423.6800000000003s)]
*  You're aging us Mahesh. I know, right? I know. I said early 2000s. I think that aged us already. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3431.04s)]
*  I'm going to give you an opportunity to talk a little bit about something you mentioned a [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3437.84s)]
*  little bit earlier and then we're going to have to wrap things up here because I'm pushing the [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3442.32s)]
*  limits of our time constraints. But you talked a little bit earlier about the FDA clearing your [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3447.36s)]
*  IND application for OTX2002 in July of this year. This is the first omega epigenomic controller for [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3452.48s)]
*  Mike driven hepatocellular carcinoma represents your first company's first foray into the clinic, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3462.32s)]
*  as I understand it. So give us an update on that program, where it's going from here. And then, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3468.88s)]
*  like I said, we're going to have to wrap things up. We may have to do a part two with Mahesh [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3473.52s)]
*  Karande. No, that's great. I would love to do a part two. So look, I think we are super excited [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3477.6s)]
*  about a hepatocellular carcinoma program. As you can imagine, we have been publicly [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3482.96s)]
*  stated that in sort of the second, the remainder part of the year, we will be [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3491.04s)]
*  dosing the first patient. So as you can imagine, we are doing this very carefully. Our [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3498.24s)]
*  clinops team has been, it's a top grade clinops team and we have talked about sites across the [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3503.92s)]
*  world. So we are really going through the motions to make sure that we are able to enroll the right [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3512.56s)]
*  patients. And first patient in will be in sort of the fourth quarter, as we have indicated. And [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3520.0s)]
*  we are working fast and furious towards that. And more on that later as we enroll the first [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3527.68s)]
*  patient, obviously we will talk about that. And then over time, we will talk about data, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3534.48s)]
*  but we are just super excited and taking our time and doing this very, very thoughtfully, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3538.4s)]
*  as this is literally a pioneering therapeutic, you know, epigenomic controller, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3545.36s)]
*  omega epigenomic controller entering a clinic and going to be in patients. So we take this [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3552.0s)]
*  very seriously and we're taking excitement with a lot of caution and trepidation, as you would [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3559.44s)]
*  imagine in the pioneering journey, but we are quietly confident and we feel very good about where [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3566.48s)]
*  we are. Yeah. Well, congratulations. As you mentioned, when you talked about it earlier, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3572.48s)]
*  you talked about it in the context of the efficiency with which you got to this point. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3576.24s)]
*  So congratulations on that. In addition to it being sort of a, you said pioneering, I guess, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3581.52s)]
*  is a fitting word being a flagship pioneering company, pioneering medicine that made its way [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3586.96s)]
*  to IND in such an efficient manner. It certainly catches a lot of interest and it caught our [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3592.0s)]
*  interest. We'll be paying attention. We'll discuss some of that data on part two. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3598.56s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. I think we will be ready in a few months time, as you can imagine, as the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3603.68s)]
*  program proceeds, you will know as we talk about data and we disclose data. I know that I can speak [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3610.0s)]
*  for myself, the whole company is just super excited that we made the transition in such a short [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9HR6kvhgmU&t=3619.2799999999997s)]
