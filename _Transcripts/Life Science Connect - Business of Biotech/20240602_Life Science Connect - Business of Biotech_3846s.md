Video Description: Just a few years ago, Daiichi Sankyo wasn't considered a player in the oncology therapeutics space, and it certainly wasn't a player in ADCs. But then, just a few years ago, who was? Fast forward to 2023, and we see an ADC arena that drove nearly $100 billion in M&A, licensing, and partnership deals, and a Daiichi Sankyo that can rightfully lay claim to lighting that fire. In fact, it was our guest on this episode of the Business of Biotech, Ken Keller, Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO at Daiichi Sankyo, who made the bold move to jump headlong into oncology armed with ADCs that, at the time, weren't exactly the darling of biotech. On this episode, Ken shares the story of his climb from "carrying the bag" all the way to the Big Biotech C-Suite, how and why Daiichi Sankyo pivoted from its roots in cardiovascular therapeutics into Oncology and ADCs, his reflections on the antibody-drug conjugate market, and a whole lot more.

*  climbed the ladder from carrying the bag and street-level business development all the way [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=49.36s)]

*  come to mind as examples. I am Matt Piller. This is the business of biotech. And today we're [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  talking with a guy who did just that in fantastic fashion, climbing the majority of his ladder with [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  Amgen before taking the reins at Daiichi Senkyo, where he's been for the past 10 years and where [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=74.32s)]
*  he's been central to the company's embrace of and leadership in oncology and the antibody drug [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=80.4s)]
*  conjugate arena. His name is Ken Keller. He's chairman of the board, president and CEO at [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Daiichi Senkyo, Incorporated, global head of the Daiichi Senkyo oncology business. And he's here [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  with me today. Ken, welcome to the show. Matt, thank you very much for having me here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=99.92s)]
*  I'm thrilled to have you here. And, you know, I do love these stories. Young folks like coming [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=106.0s)]
*  out of academia who have an interest in biotech and biopharma often ask me, they often ask me like, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=114.4s)]
*  it happens more than you can imagine. Like, what should I do next? Should I go get my MBA? Should [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=121.76s)]
*  I go to work in industry? You know, what role should I seek? And my response is usually like [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=127.2s)]
*  all of it. All of it. Like start somewhere and embrace as much of it as you possibly can. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=134.24s)]
*  And stories like yours, you know, they sort of embody that, right? They illustrate that. You [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=140.32s)]
*  started, you know, at the base level, right? Carrying the bag, like I said, and just embraced [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=145.84s)]
*  everything as you moved up the ladder at Amgen. And that's where I want to start. I want to kind [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=154.24s)]
*  of do a little bit of a retrospective on Ken Keller's career trajectory, if you will. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=158.32s)]
*  And I mean, you know, when I look at when I look at CVs, I always hesitate to put an age on people. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=165.44s)]
*  You know, you look great. You look like a young man. I mean, it's terrific. But [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=172.48s)]
*  but we do need to rewind the clock quite a bit to go back to, you know, those days where you [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  earned your business undergrad at St. John's a bit later in MBA, loyal Marymount. So if you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=182.72s)]
*  if you roll the clock back to those days, what was your career intention then coming out of that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=190.32s)]
*  undergrad and MBA experience? Yeah, great question. So I haven't been called young in a long time. So [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=195.36s)]
*  Well, I didn't I didn't I specifically did not say the specific years that you graduated from [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=205.92s)]
*  those programs. Well, it's hard for me to say this, but I graduated college from St. John's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=211.04s)]
*  40 years ago this year. Yeah. It just doesn't seem it seems like yesterday, quite honestly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=219.68s)]
*  I wish I could give you a more profound answer than what I'm going to say. But [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=227.76s)]
*  but what you said is is just absolutely perfect. And it kind of capsulates kind of my [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=232.16s)]
*  career start. When I graduated St. John's, I had an undergraduate degree in business finance. And [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=240.0s)]
*  my dad was an accountant. And I remember my dad telling me, can the salespeople understand how we [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=248.32s)]
*  make money? They bring business into our company. That's a great place to start. And you know, I [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=255.6s)]
*  think if you're in the finance world, you probably have a little bit of the sales world envy. I think [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=262.4s)]
*  my dad had that because of his coaching. The only aspiration I had after college was I wanted to get [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=267.84s)]
*  into a company and start in sales so I could really learn the business from the bottom up. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=276.23999999999995s)]
*  In terms of why I chose pharmaceuticals, I had two job offers back then. One was entry level sales [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  position at a company called ADP. And it was selling tax and basically payroll services. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=293.84s)]
*  Then I had another offer from a company called Beacham Pharmaceuticals, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=302.08s)]
*  which went on to become SmithKline Beacham and then Glaxo. Why did I choose pharmaceuticals? I knew [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=306.4s)]
*  no one in the industry. I didn't even know that pharmaceutical sales existed. What made me choose [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  that job was at that time I was driving around my family's old station wagon that had wood on the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=319.44s)]
*  side. And Beacham Pharmaceuticals gave me a company car. Oh, so there was the cool factor, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=327.92s)]
*  I get a car, I was all in. And that was the depth of my thinking of pharmaceuticals. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=337.12s)]
*  And it was one of the luckiest decisions of my life. I'm a big believer. Luck is important, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=345.36s)]
*  making the right choices obviously, but sometimes you get lucky. And that really was [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=352.72s)]
*  a decision that shaped my entire life. Yeah, for sure. Did you right off the bat embrace [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=357.76s)]
*  the life sciences role? Was that foreign territory, completely foreign territory for you? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=366.24s)]
*  Coming out of college with a finance degree like ADP, hey, if you had landed there, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=372.72s)]
*  very successful company, could have gone a lot of places there too. And I imagine the nomenclature [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=377.68s)]
*  of that space might have been a little bit more familiar to you at the time. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. I think two things. One is I worked for a person, his name is Tom Gabbia. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Tom, if you see this, I haven't spoke to you in 35 years, but thank you. I mean, that gentleman [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  took me under his wing. He was the district manager and he took me and I knew nothing about [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  pharmaceuticals, chemistry, the drug business, reimbursement. And that gentleman taught me so [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=410.72s)]
*  much. So I stumbled into the right mentor, super important. Second thing though is [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=418.24s)]
*  you very quickly learn that when you're bringing new medicines to whether it be oncologists or [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=426.32s)]
*  primary care doctors, there is something incredibly special about doing that. And what I found is back [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  then we were selling three different medicines, amoxicillin, an antibiotic, Augmentin, and a drug [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=440.8s)]
*  called thymentin, which was an IV antibiotic. And I met my wife through thymentin, literally. She was [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=448.8s)]
*  a nurse. I was working at, back then it was NYU, Bellevue, and the VA in Manhattan. And I was [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=457.92s)]
*  promoting thymentin to basically the oncologist at this university. My wife was a nurse and I met her [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=466.56s)]
*  there. Actually, a friend of hers, the chief resident and fellow there, introduced us basically. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=474.88s)]
*  And he didn't know my name. He didn't know Ken Keller. He knew me as the thymentin man. That was [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=484.0s)]
*  the drug that I was promoting. He introduced this nurse to thymentin man. And that's how we kind of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=490.96s)]
*  met. But there was something that I just gravitated to. When you bring a new medicine, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=497.84s)]
*  something that you can see the excitement in the doctor's eyes when they say, okay, this is a new [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=505.52s)]
*  tool for me to help my patients, there's a feeling there that I would have never gotten from ADP. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=512.72s)]
*  And I didn't know that when I took the job. It was the car. But to me, once you're doing something [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=520.0s)]
*  like that, you just never want to change. You always want to be bringing something new, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=526.88s)]
*  something that changes the standard of care, something that excites the medical community. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=533.36s)]
*  That's an amazing feeling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was the car and eventually the wife. Talk about [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=538.16s)]
*  perks, right? Talk about making the right decision. Who knows who you might have met at ADP, but I'm [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=543.92s)]
*  surely not as interesting as a nurse. You got it. That's fantastic. So at some point in those early [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=549.04s)]
*  days, you transitioned into Amgen. And Amgen is where you stayed for quite some time and really [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=555.84s)]
*  exercised your ladder climbing chops, if you will. Tell us a bit about your time there. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=562.48s)]
*  So I joined Amgen as the first sales training class as they were building out their commercial [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=568.32s)]
*  division. And I still have friends from that class. In that class, we've got people like [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  Dave Halal, who went on to become the CEO of Alexion. And now he's a chairman of board of a [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=582.64s)]
*  number of different companies. What was amazing about that time, I started at Amgen in my 20s [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=586.88s)]
*  and I left when I was 50. And so I grew up at Amgen. What made it so unique is it was one of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  the first biotechnology companies. And it was a company that literally had zero revenue when I [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=603.28s)]
*  joined. And any advice that I would give people, if you can join a company that is entering a period [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=609.36s)]
*  of growth, that's going to give you so many more opportunities. And so when I joined, I started as [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=618.88s)]
*  a sales rep. I graduated to my destination job, a district manager. I remember saying to my wife, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=626.0s)]
*  you know what, if I can become a district manager, we've made it. And I became a district manager. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=635.6s)]
*  And then I had a unique experience. I was offered an opportunity to go inside for a rotation, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=642.96s)]
*  a three month rotation in marketing. And I did that because the company said, look, we want you [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=651.44s)]
*  to get some inside experience before you become a regional manager. I went inside and I met people. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=658.96s)]
*  I started to work with clinical development, the idea of shaping a product and being kind of the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=667.44s)]
*  architect behind what this product or medicine would look like. That was the place I was meant [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=674.24s)]
*  to be. It was an addicting and a positive way experience. So after three months, I had a goal. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=681.04s)]
*  I had an ambition. I had a destination. I wanted to get into marketing and grow my career there. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=689.76s)]
*  Amgen gave me the opportunity to be a sales rep and then I joined marketing full time. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  Moved my family from the East Coast to the West Coast. The moment they landed, we were like, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  this is where we want to be. It was beautiful. It was sunny. But so it says the guy who's now [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=710.0s)]
*  speaking to me from New Jersey. I know. I know. Life goes in a full circle, doesn't it? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=715.68s)]
*  One thing that was really important though, and I think it defined who I was at Amgen from my entire [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=721.44s)]
*  career and even who I am today. When I joined the marketing team at Amgen as an associate product [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=726.56s)]
*  manager, that team was filled with brilliant people, senior pharmaceutical executives, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  people that were in a different league than me, at least in my mind and heart at the time. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=741.0400000000001s)]
*  They were from amazing schools and I was the marketing guy who actually knew customers. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=748.48s)]
*  That's who I was. It was like, hey, we've got this young marketing guy. He actually knows customers. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=757.12s)]
*  He's actually carried the bag. That defined me and made me different within this group of [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=762.64s)]
*  amazingly talented people. Throughout my career, I've always used that as a badge of honor. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  There's a little bit of a secret sauce in this, which is from there in any therapeutic area that [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=776.16s)]
*  I worked in or any drug, you look at all the market research in the world, but the secret for me has [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=782.56s)]
*  been developing a connection and a relationship with a handful of key opinion leaders and customers, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=790.48s)]
*  whether it be for Enbrel with rheumatoid arthritis or running the bone health business unit, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=797.6s)]
*  dealing with KOLs from osteoporosis or oncology, which is what I love. I have a group of customers [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=803.28s)]
*  that now I can pick up the phone right now. I can text them right now and they will get back to me [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=810.96s)]
*  immediately. That's always been the secret of staying connected to what is really happening. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=816.64s)]
*  You can get lost inside. You hire a lot of consultants to help you. You do a lot of [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=822.64s)]
*  market research, but always vet that and pressure test that versus a few people that you really, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=828.16s)]
*  really trust. That's been my secret element along the way. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=835.68s)]
*  Yeah. The personality and the personal relationships that you established, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  sort of a two-part question. One, did that instill the confidence in you at that young age in an [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=853.52s)]
*  industry where you're surrounded by, to your point, some pretty heady people, MDs and PhDs, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=859.6s)]
*  research scientists? Did that establish personally for you the confidence that you needed to [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=865.84s)]
*  not be completely out of your depth with those folks? One. And two, at what point, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=874.4s)]
*  can you recall at what point you sort of realized, embraced that confidence versus, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=879.76s)]
*  you can try to swim out of your depth in this space. Believe me, I do it all the time. I'm not [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=888.96s)]
*  a scientist. I love talking to people who are way smarter than me and teach me and our audience [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=893.12s)]
*  things, but I often feel out of my depth. At what point did you sort of come to this realization [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=900.08s)]
*  that, hey, I've got a strength here. I'm going to embrace it and that's going to give me the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=906.48s)]
*  confidence that I need to move forward? I remember the moment exactly. I was a [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=910.4s)]
*  product manager, maybe a marketing manager at this time, and we were working on a drug called [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=917.04s)]
*  neupogen, an amazing drug, a granulocyte colony stimulating factor that actually would stimulate [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=923.04s)]
*  the bone marrow to produce white blood cells and it would protect patients going through chemotherapy [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=929.12s)]
*  from getting infections. So a first in class, amazing drug. And I was one of the people on the [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=934.64s)]
*  team and this drug had gone from zero to about a billion dollars at Amgen and it was stagnant. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=941.52s)]
*  And in fact, the company at that time thought we had peaked. This is what the drug's going to be. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=949.28s)]
*  I had an insight and it was something that came to me from going out with customers, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=956.8s)]
*  listening to them. And then one day, and I'll try to tell this really shortly, but [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=964.8s)]
*  I was looking at why there were some oncologists who were using neupogen five, six, seven times more [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=969.84s)]
*  than other oncologists, basically in the same practice with the same number of patients. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=977.44s)]
*  And no market research could tell us why. We'd ask the question, no one could articulate it. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=984.4000000000001s)]
*  But then one day I was at the West Clinic, which is a major oncology clinic in Tennessee, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=991.2800000000001s)]
*  and I was speaking to a gentleman, Dr. Lee Schwartzberg. And Lee is one of my confidants [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=998.4s)]
*  today. And I just finally said, look, I don't understand. You're using this drug so much more [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1003.84s)]
*  than your peers. Help me understand it. We went to the charts, or he went to the charts, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1010.4s)]
*  and we found that he was thinking about the drug in a slightly different way. This drug would [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1016.16s)]
*  increase white blood cells to prevent infection. But for him, it wasn't about a drug that would [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1023.6s)]
*  prevent infection. It was a drug that would allow him to deliver the optimal, the right dose of [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1030.72s)]
*  chemotherapy without having to dose, reduce it and delay it. And so think about this, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1039.1200000000001s)]
*  you're treating women with breast cancer. And the clinical data clearly shows if you can deliver [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1045.6s)]
*  that full dose of chemotherapy and not have to reduce it because of side effects, usually lower [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1053.2s)]
*  white blood cells, you can give that woman a higher cure rate. So all of a sudden the insight was, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1059.28s)]
*  well, let's not talk about this drug just to prevent infection. Let's talk about this drug [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1067.68s)]
*  as something that enables you to deliver the optimal chemotherapy to give that woman the best [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1073.92s)]
*  chance of survival. And that was really our insight, Lee's and mine. And then we went back [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1082.1599999999999s)]
*  and we looked at how people were dosing chemotherapy across the globe. And sure enough, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1089.9199999999998s)]
*  we saw some doctors that would just religiously do not lower the dose. We have to keep that dose [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1096.96s)]
*  at this level to give the woman the best chance for cure. And others just weren't doing that. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1103.6s)]
*  And so we brought that back. We created an entire campaign around that and revenue grew [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1109.6s)]
*  over a hundred percent in 18 months. Now, to answer your question, all of a sudden, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  I was not just the junior marketer with a sales background. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1125.52s)]
*  Scott Gottlieb Yeah, not just moving product you were influencing. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1130.32s)]
*  I became the guy that came up with this insight. And with that came a lot more attention from [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1134.48s)]
*  management. But with that came a completely different level of confidence. That was when [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1140.48s)]
*  I'm like, I can do this. I deserve to be sitting in this table with other people. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1147.12s)]
*  That's also what spurred me to go back to school at night, part-time to get my MBA [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1154.8799999999999s)]
*  after I'd been out of college for 10 years. I wanted to then do more. And so that one spark [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1159.76s)]
*  just changed a lot. Scott Gottlieb Yeah. And I don't want to give short [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1169.12s)]
*  shrift to that long period of time that you spent at Amgen. But for lack of having hours and hours [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1173.44s)]
*  to talk, I'm going to fast forward to the two, I guess, most recent roles that you had there before [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1181.2s)]
*  moving on. And that's going to lead into a question. You were VP and General Manager of [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1188.96s)]
*  the Inflammation and Bone Health divisions there most recently. But your time at Amgen gave you a [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1195.04s)]
*  lot of that exposure I was talking about earlier to different modalities, to different targets, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1202.96s)]
*  to different indications. Tell me a little bit about how, one, how you made that happen, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1208.96s)]
*  right? Like how you made that happen, that exposure to so many different [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1214.72s)]
*  arenas within pharma and biopharma. And two, how those exposures shaped your, I guess, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1219.28s)]
*  your preparation to become the leader that you are today of a major global biopharmaceutical company. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1228.4s)]
*  Yeah. Great question. The pivotal opportunity I was given in my career was actually one job before [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1234.88s)]
*  becoming the Vice President and the head of Bone Health and Inflammation. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1247.3600000000001s)]
*  I was given the opportunity to move to England and be the Country Manager for Amgen in the UK and [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1251.76s)]
*  Ireland. And there you run everything about the organization. I was given that opportunity [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1258.56s)]
*  because I was not given a job that I wanted. So I was the head of marketing for oncology at Amgen. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1267.36s)]
*  The head of global oncology came open. I wanted the job. I went for the job and I didn't get the [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  job. And the CEO at the time, Kevin Schera, called me into his office and I thought he was [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1286.88s)]
*  going to give me the job that day. I did. And he said, Ken, I know you think you're going to get [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1294.16s)]
*  this job, but I'm not going to give you this job. And of course I was deflated. I said, well, Kevin, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1299.44s)]
*  why? I've done this, this, this, and this. And he asked me one question. He said, Ken, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  can you name the number of stars in this organization that you created? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1309.76s)]
*  And the truth is I was all about the marketing guy at that time. It's all about the brand, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1317.44s)]
*  the brand plans, driving revenue. I was not about developing people. And so Kevin said, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1323.84s)]
*  I'm going to give you a different job. I'm going to give you a job that you will fail [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1331.2s)]
*  unless you really embrace and understand that a leader's job is to help others be successful. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1336.88s)]
*  And so, boom, I was placed in the UK, different products that Amgen had at the time, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1343.6000000000001s)]
*  different healthcare system, different people. And I could not do that job unless I honestly [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1350.24s)]
*  focused on people. Yeah. People. And when you say focus on people, I mean, to this point in your [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1357.68s)]
*  career, you reference like your focus on external people, relationships with customers and decision [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1362.88s)]
*  makers outside in the market. Nailed that, right? Nailed that. Hit that square in the 10 ring. But [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1368.16s)]
*  now you're talking about internal development of leadership and thought. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1374.72s)]
*  Exactly. And the truth is that was not in my toolkit at the time. I framed success [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1378.96s)]
*  about coming up with the best business plan, the best marketing campaign and driving revenue. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1386.96s)]
*  And that's important, right? That's our job. You got to do that. But as you go up in the organization, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1393.6000000000001s)]
*  it really becomes your job is not just that, but it's helping people to be their very best. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1399.2s)]
*  So I went to England, did three and a half years there. Then the job came open to run the [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1405.8400000000001s)]
*  Inflammation and Bone Health business unit. And it was at a time where that drug and that business [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1412.32s)]
*  was struggling. So they needed a different lens and a different look at this. And so I went back [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1417.92s)]
*  and I took that job with a, I came back a different person. I came back as someone that [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1424.56s)]
*  genuinely, I looked at my job as creating the environment and the culture within that group [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1432.16s)]
*  so that people could be their very best, where people could have fun in their job. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1439.28s)]
*  The group was a little demoralized at the time. They were a little beaten up, giving them new hope, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1444.72s)]
*  inspiring them, changing people so they're in the right positions. And that opportunity allowed me [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1449.52s)]
*  to put kind of the new Ken Keller into play. And really things started happening from there. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1456.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty fascinating. So, I mean, that was a perfect answer to the two-part [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1463.6s)]
*  question because the second part of that question was like how those exposures prepared you. And it [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1470.0s)]
*  sounds like coming out of those experiences, developing internal folks and creating stars, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1475.04s)]
*  using your words, did that sort of inspire the confidence that it took to say, okay, like when [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1482.3999999999999s)]
*  it's time to leave Amgen, I think I'm ready to be the top dog. Yeah, it did. And because [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1488.24s)]
*  more than anything else, being in different therapeutic areas. So by the time I left Amgen, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1496.56s)]
*  I had run the inflammation and bone health business unit. I led the oncology business unit. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1502.24s)]
*  I led a country in Europe that had other areas like nephrology. And I learned that [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1508.16s)]
*  what you need to do in any therapeutic area, you can learn the science. Everyone can learn [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  the science or enough to be able to do your job. But what you have to do is have your own [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1522.8000000000002s)]
*  way of building the organization, bringing people along, helping people and the company grow. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1531.3600000000001s)]
*  If you have that, you can go anywhere. And that is what gave me the confidence to jump to Daichi [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1539.3600000000001s)]
*  Senkyo. Yeah. When you made that leap, that's been about 10 years since you... So when you made that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1546.64s)]
*  leap, you moved directly into the CEO role at Daichi Senkyo? No, I went into the first job was [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1553.68s)]
*  the head of business for the United States. And then about five years ago, I took over the CEO [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1560.32s)]
*  chairman job. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So I want to shift gears here, sort of transition into [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1566.8s)]
*  that five and 10 year period, the 10 year period since you've been with Daichi Senkyo. And the [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1573.36s)]
*  transformation that you've sort of shepherded there, the company's evolved considerably, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1579.52s)]
*  I think, during your tenure, the move into oncology and more recently, the ADC space has been [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1586.8s)]
*  under your watch. So tell me a little bit about that. I guess just frame it up. We'll get into [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1594.0s)]
*  the details, but frame it up, like what you walked into and what led to, like what sort of inspired [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1599.28s)]
*  you to start crafting and manipulating to move into a different sort of area? When I joined Daichi [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1607.28s)]
*  Senkyo, it was literally a hundred year old Japanese pharmaceutical company with an incredibly [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1615.04s)]
*  successful background in cardiovascular disease based on drugs like Omer Sartin, which is one of [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1624.1599999999999s)]
*  the first ARBs on the market, drugs like Effiant, which is an antiplatelet. So very, very strong [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1630.32s)]
*  foundation in cardiovascular disease, a place I'd never worked. What really excited me about [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1635.68s)]
*  joining the organization was their intent to develop the next growth pillar for the company, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1642.8s)]
*  which is oncology. And there is, I've had the opportunity, joining Amgen early especially, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1649.52s)]
*  but then working in different business units, there's something different about building an [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1657.84s)]
*  organization than joining something that's already built and you're just running it. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1663.2s)]
*  So the appeal was to build an oncology organization on the foundation of the cardiovascular [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1669.2s)]
*  strengths. And when I joined Daichi Senkyo, I had no oncology products. We had a few in the pipeline [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1675.92s)]
*  and that was the intent as expressed by the CEO, George Nakayama at the time. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1683.8400000000001s)]
*  What we have done over the last 10 years is our scientists developed this antibody drug [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1690.0s)]
*  congenit technology and it's really simply the concept of making chemotherapy smart [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1696.24s)]
*  to act like a heat seeking missile to the cancer cells. That concept's been around for decades. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1703.68s)]
*  The first ADC was launched in 2000. Between 2000 and 2015, most ADCs had failed [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1710.96s)]
*  and as a category, people had lost enthusiasm. But our scientists in Tokyo, they developed a new [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1720.3200000000002s)]
*  technology, a DXV technology, and that just opened up the door for a platform technology that we [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1730.16s)]
*  believed could yield four, five, six, seven different new medicines. And so the promise of that [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1739.04s)]
*  is what gave the entire organization the courage to say, we're going to do this and we're going to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1747.52s)]
*  go all in on it. Yeah. Yeah. So before we get into some specifics around that ADC program, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1752.64s)]
*  just generally, I think this will resonate with a lot of listeners who have worked in organizations [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1760.64s)]
*  where there's maybe a public or even internal conceptual embrace of some monumental change. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1767.84s)]
*  But then when it's time to build the foundation of that monumental change, you encounter some [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1779.12s)]
*  maybe friction, some roadblocks, some challenges. When you're doing this, and to your point, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1786.3999999999999s)]
*  a 120 plus year old Japanese company that's rooted, grounded, strong culture, there are [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1791.92s)]
*  surely going to be challenges. There are surely going to be challenges where, yeah, we want to [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1800.3200000000002s)]
*  do this, but there are going to be buts. But hey, let's pull back on the reins there a little bit. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1805.6000000000001s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about that. What fundamentally, without getting into, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1813.1200000000001s)]
*  we'll talk specifically about the ADC program, but what did it take or what does it take to say, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1818.24s)]
*  listen, we're going to do this, we're going to see this through. And when you face challenges, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1824.88s)]
*  how do you deal with them? Potential roadblocks or cultural, I guess, kind of stops. How do you [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1828.48s)]
*  work through that? To transform a company around a technology that is different and new, tons of [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1835.04s)]
*  skepticism. As I said before, ADCs were looked at as yesterday's news. Here's what made it possible. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1843.68s)]
*  The C-suite, and I'm talking about the executive management committee, there's like five people. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1854.5600000000002s)]
*  Those five people united together and their will, their conviction made it happen. You can never [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1861.8400000000001s)]
*  transform an organization unless you get that support from the very, very top. Because it goes [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1871.76s)]
*  across the board of the company. The commercial part of it, quite frankly, is the tail of the dog. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1880.32s)]
*  When you're talking about changing a company, a complete company, you're talking about getting [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1886.56s)]
*  the manufacturing organization to invest hundreds of millions of dollars before you know if you [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1891.44s)]
*  really have a product. Just think about that. That's incredible. You've got your development [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1899.04s)]
*  organization, your regulatory organization. Everyone is making investments years before the [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1906.32s)]
*  drug will ever launch without a sure thing. And so you've got to get that conviction from the top. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1912.32s)]
*  That's the first part of it. Then you have to, the people at the top, they have to frame for [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1921.04s)]
*  everyone in the organization what is in play and what's not. Because as you can imagine, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1927.6s)]
*  groups would come and say, well, we need to invest $50 million to develop this manufacturing line. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1934.48s)]
*  You can't do that if anyone thinks that this is a halfway bet. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1941.84s)]
*  The CEO, the chief operating officer, and myself, we made it very, very clear that this is going to [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1948.1599999999999s)]
*  be the future of the company. We wanted everyone to prepare and bet their jobs on this. Now, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1955.68s)]
*  the question that people might have is, how would you have the courage to do that? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1966.8s)]
*  You're literally betting the company on transforming it. For us, everything changed [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1971.6000000000001s)]
*  when we presented the phase one data. These ADCs looked great curing mice. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1978.88s)]
*  There were a lot of mice in my time. The phase one data though, and this is what makes oncology so [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1987.0400000000002s)]
*  incredible, this is 120 patients, metastatic breast cancer, who had failed four, five, six lines of [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=1993.2s)]
*  therapy. Unfortunately, these people in really dire straits, they really lost all hope. In those [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2003.76s)]
*  patients, our drug demonstrated a 60% response rate, 60% after all of that. We saw that internally [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2013.04s)]
*  and we thought we had something special, but literally the CEO, the COO, other members of the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2023.76s)]
*  EMC, we went together to where the data was presented. We saw the reaction and we gathered [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2031.12s)]
*  the thought leaders. They looked the thought leaders in their eyes and said, what do you think of this? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2039.2s)]
*  That was almost back to the very beginning, being connected to the customers. When we saw what they [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2047.68s)]
*  saw their eyes and they told us what you have here is transformative. I actually think that [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2055.84s)]
*  single meeting, it was at a meeting called ASCO, and that room where there was maybe 10 [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2063.44s)]
*  investigators and the five of us, that gave the leaders of this company the conviction [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2070.08s)]
*  to in essence bet the company. Yeah, that's a super unique, I'm sure an exciting, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2076.88s)]
*  super interesting experience for a company, as I said, that's been around for a long, long time, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2083.36s)]
*  very well established. It's almost like an injection, like a major injection of that [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2089.44s)]
*  biotech startup kind of feel like, hey, we're onto something here. Probably doesn't happen as often [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2094.2400000000002s)]
*  as you might think in companies like the H.E. Senkio. The platform, the ADC platform that you [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2099.52s)]
*  mentioned, because the other thing at face value, at surface value, you look at that time and to [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2106.48s)]
*  your point, the industry was still kind of stinging from the hope and then kind of [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2112.72s)]
*  fall, right? Like the fall of ADCs, the fall of their promise. So that platform, I mean, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2119.6s)]
*  the company must have known that it was onto something that was going to sort of revitalize [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2127.2799999999997s)]
*  this ADC space. Otherwise, it's a scary enough proposition to say, hey, we're going to make this [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2133.12s)]
*  monumental shift. Even scarier when you're doing so on the heels of industrial scale failure, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2140.32s)]
*  for lack of a better word, of the modality. Yeah. So the way this came about was there's a [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2149.52s)]
*  gentleman in our research labs in Shinagawa, Tokyo. It's Dr. Akatsuma. And him and his team, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2158.8s)]
*  they worked quietly for a decade on this ADC technology. And so while others kind of gave up, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2168.56s)]
*  because from the first launch, there was only two other ADCs that had launched in 20 years. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2176.16s)]
*  They weren't very successful. But what they did is they took this old technology [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2182.7200000000003s)]
*  and they revamped it and they made it new. The technical part of it is they created a new payload [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2189.52s)]
*  and very quickly, what an ADC simply is, is it's an antibody drug conjugate that is linked to a [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2197.12s)]
*  payload, a payload like a chemotherapy agent. And so rather than the chemotherapy working everywhere, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  the antibody drug conduit takes it right to the cancer cell to exert its cytotoxicity. But what [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2211.3599999999997s)]
*  they did is they created a new payload, a payload that would diffuse outside of the cancer cell [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  so that it could exert its cytotoxicity in the tumor microenvironment. They created an ADC that [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2225.92s)]
*  had an eight to one antibody to drug ratio and a new linker technology. So the entire ADC was new. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2233.0400000000004s)]
*  And so it was engineered specifically to do a few things. We saw the results pre-clinically [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2242.88s)]
*  and then we saw the results clinically. And the words that we used here at the company is [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2250.16s)]
*  we are going to create the world's oldest biotech startup. That's literally the words we use. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2258.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, we were going to start a 120 year old biotech startup. And our bosses gave us the [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2267.12s)]
*  freedom to dream that big and to protect us because you could never build an oncology division [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2275.76s)]
*  to work with the speed you need. And I'll give you a great example. In cardiovascular disease, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2285.28s)]
*  which was what we did, typically development is one or two clinical studies, thousands of patients, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2290.6400000000003s)]
*  thousands of patients. That's cardiovascular disease. In oncology, today we're running over [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2300.56s)]
*  70 trials. Trials can range from 50 patients to maybe 500 patients, not thousands. In cardiovascular [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2307.6s)]
*  disease, that study, our last big drug, that study took seven years. In oncology, studies take [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2315.36s)]
*  a year, months. And so the speed, the amount of changes that you have to do, the mindset you need [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2323.44s)]
*  in oncology, completely different than cardiovascular disease. So unless you really are able to protect [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2331.68s)]
*  that group to be nimble, be flexible, be quick, you can never do it. And we purposely carved this [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2338.56s)]
*  oncology business outside from Daichi Senkyou. And it really has made a huge difference. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2346.0s)]
*  Scott Cunningham Yeah, yeah. Just real quick question on the technology. When I look at the [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2353.28s)]
*  ADC space, today it's a thriving development space, lots of players. And I'll get your [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2359.2s)]
*  opinions on that in a little bit. But when you look at those players, many different business [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2366.0s)]
*  models, so many players who are just, they're outsourcing the antibody, they're outsourcing [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2371.84s)]
*  the linker technology, or they're outsourcing the payload. Maybe they're outsourcing all of it and [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2376.1600000000003s)]
*  putting it together on a platform. Maybe they're developing one element of those three internally [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2382.08s)]
*  and outsourcing others. I mean, there's very many permutations. Is the work going on there holistic [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2386.48s)]
*  in that you're creating your own antibodies, your own linker technology, and your own payloads? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2394.1600000000003s)]
*  So, ours is a very, the linker technology, and the engineering part of it, we own, we did it ourselves [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2399.6800000000003s)]
*  in our labs. In terms of the commercial scale manufacturing, we use many different contract [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2408.7200000000003s)]
*  manufacturing organizations. So, we've got people making the antibodies for us. We do the conjugation [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2415.6s)]
*  ourselves. So, it really is, it's such a complex manufacturing process that in order to do it, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2421.6800000000003s)]
*  you do rely on outside manufacturing organizations. We do quite a bit. But the science, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2428.24s)]
*  the engineering is all Daichi, thank you. Yeah. So, that science and engineering is obviously [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2435.2s)]
*  foundational, fundamental. It's happening in Japan. You've got something. We're going to move on it. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2440.4799999999996s)]
*  Now, to your point, there's this monumental shift in the team, the rest of the team, right? All the [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2447.4399999999996s)]
*  folks who are supporting it clinically, supporting the clinical trials, who are perhaps [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2454.0s)]
*  already working on some pre-commercialization efforts and on and on and on. So, that requires [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2461.04s)]
*  some shift too, whether it's taking the tools and people and resources that you have and [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2467.28s)]
*  manipulating them into this new arena or bringing on new talent and resources. Tell me a little bit [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2473.52s)]
*  about that organizationally. What sort of HR and structural changes did the company need to make [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2479.52s)]
*  to accommodate the focus? You just nailed it. And you asked me earlier, what were some of the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2485.84s)]
*  challenges? Building the team and bringing in the oncology talent early, early was the biggest [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2490.32s)]
*  challenge. Because as you can imagine, who's Daichi Sankyo in oncology? Right. No one in oncology knew [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2497.44s)]
*  Daichi Sankyo. And so early on, it was difficult to attract the right kind of people. Now, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2504.96s)]
*  now that's changed completely, right? As people have seen the success of this ADC platform, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2515.36s)]
*  they've seen what our first drug and HER2 has done. The great thing about oncology is that people [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2521.36s)]
*  love and they flock to the next great big thing. I mean, people in oncology, I mean, we live, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2529.84s)]
*  what really rolls our socks up and down is to bring that next great drug to the oncology community. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2536.48s)]
*  So, once people saw the success, wow, all of a sudden everyone wants to be here. That was not [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2541.92s)]
*  the case early on. And so, at first, we brought in a handful of very talented people, but more so, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2547.76s)]
*  we wanted to recruit people that had the mindset to be a builder. Right. And that's not a small [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2557.04s)]
*  difference. There are some people that have joined Daichi Sankyo from very large companies [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2566.48s)]
*  who have everything in place. They've been working in oncology for 30 years. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2574.2400000000002s)]
*  And they found it difficult to be able to do their jobs without everything in place. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2578.2400000000002s)]
*  And so, we were really thoughtful of bringing people in who believed in what we were doing, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2586.32s)]
*  but also had that builder mindset that could build as they were running. So, that's super important. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2592.0s)]
*  And the other part of it is great people attract great people. And so, early on, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2597.92s)]
*  we were hiring for technical capabilities, but even more so, we were hiring people that we believed [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2602.7200000000003s)]
*  could bring other people with them. And for the most part, we got that right. And then success [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2610.4s)]
*  leads to more success. But that was a huge, huge part of it. Yeah. Give us a sense for [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2616.96s)]
*  the scale of that oncology effort now in terms of people and resources. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2624.08s)]
*  So, I was employee number one in the oncology business unit. Today, we've got over 2,000 people [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2629.76s)]
*  working in oncology globally in over 55 countries. And like my direct reports, I've got people in [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2636.4s)]
*  Munich, I've got people in Tokyo, I've got people in the West Coast of the United States. And then [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2645.84s)]
*  we really, really are across the globe. I will say one really interesting thing. We did a lot [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2650.8s)]
*  of our hiring and building during COVID. And I will tell you, COVID made us better. And here's why. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2657.92s)]
*  And when you think about it, it won't be a surprise, but I'd grown up with this idea of [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2668.56s)]
*  your staff, your people need to be here in Baskin Ridge, New Jersey. They need to be where the home [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2674.7200000000003s)]
*  office is, right? Yeah. With COVID, I didn't have that luxury. And so, because of that, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2679.36s)]
*  I opened up my horizons and I hired people across the globe. And I was able to get better talent. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2686.24s)]
*  Better talent. And I wish I had learned that years ago. And so, that was one of those unintended [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2695.52s)]
*  really blessings. And there's no blessings of COVID, but that opened up my eyes and it actually [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2701.84s)]
*  helped us grow faster to be an oncology leader. Yeah, yeah, for sure. You mentioned [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2708.08s)]
*  the criticality of the support of the C-suite when you're taking on a monumental pivot. Get it? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2716.32s)]
*  Had it? I got that. But when you look around sort of at the landscape of players, stakeholders, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2723.2000000000003s)]
*  shareholders, people who you need to influence, who else kind of falls on that list? What and [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2730.4s)]
*  who else did you need to influence to make sure that everyone was paddling in the same direction? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2738.88s)]
*  And kind of lay the foundation for success. The three or four people and groups that have [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2745.44s)]
*  been my partners in this the entire time and the people that you need aboard. First, you've got to [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2753.04s)]
*  have a chief financial officer who believes in a mission and is willing to make early investments [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2759.1200000000003s)]
*  and feel the pain in the P&L. When you're building an oncology division from scratch, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2767.76s)]
*  there's a lot of investment and there's a lot of red early. If the CFO doesn't believe in that, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2774.4s)]
*  it's not going to happen. Right? Second thing is your HR person, your HR leader, and we have a [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2781.76s)]
*  chief people officer here at Daiichi Sankyo, Simon King, they've got to, in essence, be your [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2789.52s)]
*  right-hand person because they're the ones that are trying to help you attract the right people [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2795.2000000000003s)]
*  and the right talent. And you know you're going to have to build a team before the work can happen. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2802.24s)]
*  So if you have finance and HR aboard, you're really on your way, but that's super, super critical. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2810.4799999999996s)]
*  But then there's a third piece of it, which I think I underappreciated early on, and that is, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2817.4399999999996s)]
*  when we started in oncology, we had another business, a specialty business unit, the [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2824.4799999999996s)]
*  cardiovascular business. And at a time when I'm saying, I need more people, I need more resources, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2830.24s)]
*  I'm competing with the resources from the cardiovascular division. And at first, I really [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2839.7599999999998s)]
*  didn't invest enough time to help them understand what the potential was, what the future is, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2846.24s)]
*  why they should be okay with me taking away some of their resources. And that seems like a minor [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2852.3199999999997s)]
*  thing, but it's something that I could have done better with because if you don't have [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2857.92s)]
*  that in the same place, you'll end up with a lot of friction. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2864.4s)]
*  Scott Cunningham Yeah, yeah. Well, and I can imagine, I mean, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2868.2400000000002s)]
*  in a situation like that, like it's one thing if you're a small biotech and you're reallocating [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2871.52s)]
*  resources from perhaps a product that is not reading out the way that you had anticipated, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2877.04s)]
*  destined for failure, or the indication has some better op, whatever it might be, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2882.7200000000003s)]
*  that's one thing. But when you're talking about the Aichi Sankyo cardiovascular business, I mean, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2887.6s)]
*  incredible market as it is, foundational product, I mean, I can imagine those challenges when [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2892.96s)]
*  we're not trivial. Scott Cunningham [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2899.52s)]
*  No, they really weren't. And today, I think we're in a great place, which is we've got [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2901.12s)]
*  two highly successful pillars of business. And now people can see the benefits of the [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2906.56s)]
*  investments we made. We've gone from zero to basically our run rate right now is over [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2913.12s)]
*  $3 billion a year in oncology. And so now people get it. But I guess my learning, if I ever get an [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2918.64s)]
*  opportunity to do something like this again, really invest the time in the people that have [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2926.4s)]
*  the legacy and have built the organization. And for us, it was a cardiovascular group, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2931.2s)]
*  make them understand that this is going to make us all stronger. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2935.92s)]
*  Scott Cunningham Yeah. All right, I want to shift gears for [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2939.92s)]
*  for another minute. I want to ask you sort of a philosophical question. And I'm probably going to [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2944.08s)]
*  paraphrase this, but I read that you've said, I'm going to read this. When you have that spark of [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2949.6s)]
*  innovation and that opportunity that you believe in, be beholden to that opportunity, not the status [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2956.0s)]
*  quo. I'm with you up to that point. You then say, if that new opportunity doesn't fit who you are, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2962.48s)]
*  you've got to change who you are. That's the philosophical point I want to press you on a [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2969.8399999999997s)]
*  little bit. You know, there's like, there's a, I don't know if it's a prevailing mentality. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2975.92s)]
*  But you know, there's this idea like, stay true to who you are, right? Like, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2982.0s)]
*  be who you are and find where you fit. And this quote that I just read sounds a little bit [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2987.12s)]
*  contrarian to that. Sounds a little bit contrarian, like, hey, if the spark of innovation and change [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2992.64s)]
*  that you want to make happen requires you to change you, change you. Yeah. Great question. So [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=2998.56s)]
*  for me, in the business of biotech pharmaceutical, what drives the company, the lifeblood of everything [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3008.4s)]
*  we do is scientific innovation. It's that new product, that new medicine that can change the [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3016.96s)]
*  world, change the standard of care, transform breast cancer like we've done with her too. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3023.6s)]
*  That's what we live for. And you know, the idea, that's what is so rare. That's the great medicine [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3028.7999999999997s)]
*  is the unicorn. And so to me, when you have that, that's what you need to follow. That's what you [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3038.72s)]
*  need to be beholden to. I can make, there's many talented commercial people in the world, right? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3047.6s)]
*  I'm telling you, commercial people can build a commercial model to fit a great medicine. That [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3055.2s)]
*  is a lot easier to do than to find that great medicine. You know, we've seen it time and time [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3061.6s)]
*  again. You know, Merck, who is now our partner for three of our ADCs, Merck, an unbelievable company [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3067.92s)]
*  in oncology today, right? Built on a single product, Catruda. 15 years ago, Merck was not [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3075.76s)]
*  thought of as an oncology company, right? And you've seen this time and time again. I mean, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3084.8s)]
*  you know, look at the obesity drugs today. None of that existed, you know, 10 years ago. So I really [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3090.0s)]
*  do think the right way to do this is you follow the science, right? Where that leads you, then you [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3097.6800000000003s)]
*  adjust the rest of your organization because that is what's so rare. And, you know, and when I say [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3104.96s)]
*  that, you know, don't change who you are. To me, that's more about the values of the organization, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3111.76s)]
*  right? Who you are, whether it's in cardiovascular disease or oncology, you know, the fabric of the [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3117.28s)]
*  organization, what are the behaviors that really are important to you? Those things don't change. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3123.84s)]
*  Yeah. But follow the science. And when you've got something, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3130.96s)]
*  you know, change everything to bring that to patients. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Good. So, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3134.96s)]
*  you know, I'm going to ask you another challenging question, perhaps challenging. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3141.2000000000003s)]
*  Change management, especially as it relates to HR, is not always sunshine and roses, no matter how [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3149.52s)]
*  great the idea or grand the gesture or, you know, true the intention, you know, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3155.52s)]
*  there are always going to be, especially in a large organization, folks who you just, you know, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3161.04s)]
*  it's like the difference between a horse and a mule. The horse wants to please and the mule wants [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3166.24s)]
*  to lock its feet up and not be pulled, right? Like, so what of those folks, like what is your, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3170.24s)]
*  what's your philosophy on, like, you know, they may bring great value to the organization in some [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3176.4s)]
*  capacity, but they're not willing to embrace a major pivotal, you know, kind of change like that. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3181.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, we've had those experiences too. I've had those experiences. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3188.0s)]
*  I think my approach has always been, you know, start with the mindset that, you know, everybody [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3192.4s)]
*  wants to do a good job because I really believe that's true. Everybody wants to do a good job. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3201.6s)]
*  And so as a leader, your responsibility is to help people see what the future could be [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3207.2s)]
*  to articulate clearly, definitively, you know, here's what we need from this group or what we [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3213.8399999999997s)]
*  need from you. Here are the expectations. So many times I've seen in my career where kind of people [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3221.7599999999998s)]
*  don't come aboard or they kind of go sideways. And the truth is, whoever that leader was, they [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3229.52s)]
*  didn't articulate what the expectations are. I always tell people, you know, year-end reviews, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3236.4s)]
*  it's an open book test. I'm giving you the answers along the way. And so many people, you know, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3242.64s)]
*  they get their review at the end of the year and like, I'm surprised, you know, I thought I was [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3248.96s)]
*  doing great. And so the leader, when you change things, needs to be very, very clear on what the [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3253.04s)]
*  expectations are, not only for the business results, but also for the behaviors. And what [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3259.52s)]
*  I've seen is when people resist change, especially as here in Daiichi Senkyou, you know, a lot of it [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3266.64s)]
*  is sometimes the business doesn't fit who they are as a person. I talked about speed and flexibility [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3274.16s)]
*  and nimbleness. You have to have that. You have to be willing to operate at the 80% level in terms of, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3280.8s)]
*  do I know this answer or not? Right. You've got to make those bets. Some people just can't do that. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3288.2400000000002s)]
*  And, you know, unfortunately, teams will only grow as fast and as healthy as each member of the team. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3294.88s)]
*  And so if you do have people that are recalcitrant, they just can't get aboard. They're just, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3304.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, kind of locked in the past. You know, you've got to move on, right, from most people. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3310.48s)]
*  And in my career, I think I've gotten better at it. But I do believe that the answer to that is [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3317.44s)]
*  upfront. It's an open book test. Guys, here's where we're headed. Here's what I need from you. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3326.64s)]
*  And really having that dialogue. And so that's really important. But you cannot carry people. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3332.48s)]
*  You just can't. And, you know, you always try to find the right thing for the person [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3338.32s)]
*  and help them along their way. Yeah. Well, one of the things to be excited about, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3345.6s)]
*  if you're any of those people at every level of your team, is what I mentioned earlier, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3350.16s)]
*  and the fact that Daichi Senkyo's work in the ADC space sort of ushered in or even happened [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3353.92s)]
*  in advance of this explosion that we've seen now. Like I said, I mean, it's just an incredible [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3363.52s)]
*  development arena is just insane right now. So there's got to be motivating in and of itself. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3368.56s)]
*  Like, hey, we're in a hot, hot arena right now. So tell me about your perception of that arena. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3374.16s)]
*  Like when you look at the landscape, again, even, you know, some of these new and emerging [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3380.08s)]
*  companies, the much smaller companies that are working on ADC development right now. I mean, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3384.08s)]
*  it's got to be pretty mind blowing. The success that Daichi Senkyo has had, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3387.44s)]
*  it has absolutely ignited this incredible enthusiasm for ADCs. When we look at, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3392.48s)]
*  when we started working on our ADCs in about 2012, 2010, very few companies were doing research. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3398.96s)]
*  As I mentioned, it was passe news. It was yesterday's science. In the last 18 months, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3406.88s)]
*  there's been over $80 billion of M&A in the ADC space with Pfizer and Satellogenetics and others. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3413.04s)]
*  There are now hundreds of ADC programs there. So our success has ignited this incredible, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3422.24s)]
*  incredible growth. I do see a future where, wherever chemotherapy is used today, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3429.2s)]
*  it is highly likely in 10 years that that will be displaced by antibody drug conjugates. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3437.2s)]
*  Tanner Iskra So I still believe we're only at the very, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3442.56s)]
*  beginning of what ADCs will look like in the future. The great news for patients is, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3447.36s)]
*  you know, the more companies work on this technology, I mean, science is beautiful. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3453.76s)]
*  It just gets better and better and better. That's great for everybody. You know, we've got to stay [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3458.6400000000003s)]
*  ahead of it. And we're working on a lot of different new technologies in ADCs. But here's [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3462.96s)]
*  where we are today. So we've got one antibody drug conjugate on the market in HER2. In just four [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3470.96s)]
*  years, it has five indications. It has not just replaced old ADCs, it's transformed how you treat [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3478.56s)]
*  cancer with indications like a HER2 low indication, which allows us to help 60% of all the women with [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3487.6s)]
*  breast cancer out there in a category that had almost no treatments before. We just last week [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3496.4s)]
*  got a tumor agnostic indication, meaning this drug can be used for HER2 positive disease [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3502.88s)]
*  across the spectrum of cancer. We've got two other ADCs that have been filed with the FDA, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3509.76s)]
*  one that we expect to be approved this summer, one at the end of the year. And we've got seven [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3519.04s)]
*  antibody drug conjugants, all based on this platform technology in the clinic today, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3525.6s)]
*  and all demonstrating impressive ability to shrink tumors. So, you know, we've got a lot coming, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3531.36s)]
*  but the beautiful thing is there are dozens of other ADCs that are also close to being approved. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3538.72s)]
*  And I just think that's what makes oncology unreal in terms of excitement. New drugs all the time, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3547.68s)]
*  new standards of care, better for patients, and that's what makes it great. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3554.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you just answered the next question I was going to ask. I was going to ask you, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3560.8s)]
*  you ignited the transformation industry-wide that H.E. Sankyo did, but that's, you know, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3565.36s)]
*  in this business, you know, that's not enough. You don't do that and then rest on your laurels. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3572.16s)]
*  So I was going to ask you, what are you doing to differentiate from that crowded field now? But I [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3576.0s)]
*  think you just answered it. I mean, you know, the potential to have so many candidates in [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3580.16s)]
*  development and the potential to be looking at as many approved products as there have been in the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3586.72s)]
*  past, what, 20 years, you know, in short order. Yeah. But yeah, one of the things we are doing [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3591.52s)]
*  to add to my previous statement is oncology is all about speed of development, because as you said, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3598.7999999999997s)]
*  people are developing new drugs all the time. And so unlike cardiovascular disease, where studies [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3605.68s)]
*  take forever, how fast you do a study and how many studies you can do, that dictates your [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3610.96s)]
*  competitive success. And so one of the things that we've done is in our first five antibody drug [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3617.8399999999997s)]
*  conjugants, we formed two partnerships, one with AstraZeneca for our first two ADCs, and then [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3625.2s)]
*  another partnership with Merck for ADC 3, 4, and 5. Now, why did we do that? The reason we did that [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3632.72s)]
*  is because we believe so much in the potential of this technology that we decided if we kept these [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3639.9199999999996s)]
*  drugs to ourselves, we would only be able to bring this drug to a certain number of patients, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3648.0s)]
*  because we couldn't do all the studies fast enough. And so we decided to partner with, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3653.52s)]
*  quite frankly, the two most successful oncology companies last decade, Merck and AstraZeneca. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3660.4s)]
*  So they're our partners today. And with them, we're able to do three or four times more clinical [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3664.96s)]
*  studies and obtain hopefully three or four times more indications and help three to four times more [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3671.44s)]
*  patients than we could ourselves. And that's what competition not forces you to do, but if you want [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3678.8s)]
*  to stay ahead of the competition, being bold, being fast, getting those studies done, bringing [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3687.84s)]
*  them to patients, that's what it's all about. Yeah, that's a fascinating story. I've been abusive [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3693.6000000000004s)]
*  of your time. I feel like, you know, if you didn't have other things to get to, and you've got a lot [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3700.0s)]
*  to get to, I could talk to you for the rest of the morning. But we'll conclude with this. What's [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3704.56s)]
*  next for Ken Keller? You know, a vacation maybe? A little break? Take the wife, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3711.44s)]
*  take the wife to someplace nice and warm? I just took my wife, my three adult kids, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3717.36s)]
*  my son-in-law, and my three grandkids. We just spent a week in Japan last week. So that vacation [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3724.6400000000003s)]
*  exhausted me. So I'm glad I'm back at work. No, I know that feeling. I've not traveled with quite [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3731.84s)]
*  that try, but I know what you're saying about coming back from vacation and looking forward to [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3739.2000000000003s)]
*  get back to the routine. So yeah, what is next for you though, in terms of your leadership there? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3743.6s)]
*  I mean, you've given us a good outlay of what's next for the company, you know, corporate-wise. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3749.52s)]
*  What's next for you? Yeah, I love what I'm doing right now. And the way I see this playing out, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3753.68s)]
*  in just a few years, Daiichi Senkyo is going to be one of the biggest oncology companies in the world. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3759.68s)]
*  Today, Daiichi Senkyo ranks 15 in terms of global revenue and oncology. In just a few years, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3767.92s)]
*  we'll be top 10. By 2030, we should have six or seven ADCs on the market and over 30 indications [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3774.0s)]
*  across a dozen different tumor types. So I'm proud of where we are, but I got to tell you, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3781.8399999999997s)]
*  I've been in the job 10 years, I still feel like it's just a start. And, you know, as long as I [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3788.48s)]
*  have that feeling, I hope I get to stay in my seat. Yeah, yeah. Well, I hope so too. You're [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3794.48s)]
*  doing great work and you're fantastic to talk to. I've enjoyed every minute of the conversation, Ken. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3800.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for this opportunity. Oh, thanks for joining me. So that's Daiichi Senkyo's CEO, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhOsyofBET8&t=3805.36s)]
