Video Description: Tal Zaks, M.D. was Chief Medical Officer at Moderna before, during, and immediately following the company's headline role during the COVID pandemic. If that doesn't pique your interest about the stories he can tell, this episode of the Business of Biotech surely will. Tal is now leading a new mRNA-centric startup called Exsilio Therapeutics, which Advancing RNA's Anna Rose Welch and I dig into in part two of our talk with Tal, slated for release in early January. Yep, Story Time With Tal is so good, we doubled up the episodes with him. Tune in for insight from the early days of mRNA that you probably haven't heard before, and stay for a glimpse of its future role in therapeutics at Exsilio with one of the foremost thinkers in the space.

# Biotech Story Time With Tal Zaks, M.D. (Part 1)
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [December 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8)
*  You know, Rose, I was I was thinking before I came into the studio today that I should [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=0.0s)]
*  have been thinking. I was thinking I should have made a large bag of popcorn for today's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=7.96s)]
*  episode. Do you know why? Why? Do you remember the last time we talked with tall, tall Zachs? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=15.72s)]
*  It's been a while, but I remember being wrapped, wrapped, entertained. The stories were just [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  titillating, right? Like I was on the edge of my seat, sometimes in disbelief. And I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=29.76s)]
*  thought this is a popcorn worthy episode. Alas, I did not bring any popcorn to my chagrin. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=34.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. Next time. Bad planning. A lot of people know him as the guy who was chief [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=42.24s)]
*  medical officer at Moderna before, during and after the company became a household name [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=48.52s)]
*  thanks to its mRNA based answer to covid. But even without that gold star next to his [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=54.44s)]
*  name, Dr. Tall Zachs has built a fascinating career as a physician, scientist, an investor, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=60.48s)]
*  a board member and a biotech builder. Today, he's CEO and chair of the board of directors [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=65.84s)]
*  at Exilio Therapeutics, a non executive director at five companies, I think, including Teva [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=71.84s)]
*  Pharmaceuticals, a private equity partner at Orbomed and probably holds a few more titles [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  that I'm missing. Storyteller. He's not that we're setting the bar too high for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=82.88s)]
*  telling right now, but he is a prolific storyteller. Dr. Seuss over here. I'm Matt [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Piller. And I'm Anna Rose Welch. And on today's episode of the Business of Biotech, it's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=92.72s)]
*  story time with Tall. So stay tuned because the stories Tall tells are not Tall tells, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  although I guess they would be Tall tells, just not in the way you think I meant it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=104.24s)]
*  You didn't see that coming. And that really hit me over the head like a shovel. His stories [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=107.76s)]
*  are packed with biotech business building insights gained over a career spent spanning [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=115.04s)]
*  leadership roles at GSK, Sanofi, Teva, Moderna, Orbomed and now Exilio Therapeutics and probably, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  like I said, a whole lot more. Tall, welcome to the show. It's a real pleasure to be here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=128.8s)]
*  We are absolutely thrilled to have you. And as I said, I'm sorry if we set the bar too [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=135.2s)]
*  high, but the last time we chatted, Anna Rose and I came away thinking like, this guy has [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=139.64s)]
*  got so many great anecdotes that not only great stories, but like a lot of meat in them, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=144.16s)]
*  right? A lot of meat for biotech builders. So we're really looking forward to the conversation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=150.16s)]
*  today. We have a ton to get through. I don't know if we'll do it all in one episode. We [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  might have to revisit with a part two. But before we get into the Exilio story, I want [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=157.32s)]
*  to get to know you a little bit and introduce you to the audience. So, and I'm going to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=163.08s)]
*  go way back. We're going to rewind the clock quite a ways. You immigrated to the U.S. from [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=168.0s)]
*  Israel to do your postdoc at the National Cancer Institute and presumably at the time [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=173.0s)]
*  practice medicine. I mean, you know, you practice medicine back then. When you made that move, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=178.44s)]
*  was that your sole intention career wise to come over here and practice? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=184.56s)]
*  To be fair, back in the day, I just had an opportunity to come to the Mecca of scientific [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=191.64s)]
*  research. Now I trained in the early days as a physician scientist and MD, PhD. It wasn't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=198.6s)]
*  really a track. I sort of built it because I got interested in an area of medicine that's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  called tumor immunology. Back then it wasn't the thing that it has become since. But I [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=210.32s)]
*  was super curious and I had a wonderful opportunity to come to the lab of Dr. Steve Rosenberg [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=215.56s)]
*  at the National Cancer Institute. And, you know, as an immigrant coming from across [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=220.6s)]
*  to the Mecca of the NIH, you don't really think what's going to happen next. You just [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=224.84s)]
*  say, boy, I'm at a place that has really redefined our understanding of immunonecology benefits [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=230.24s)]
*  for patients with cancer. And the sky's the limit. And I have to tell you, I am to this [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=239.12s)]
*  immigrant to this country and really, if anything, have been fortunate to take advantage of an [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=246.6s)]
*  ecosystem where truly the sky's the limit in terms of what we can achieve for patients, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  for ourselves, for mankind. So I, in all honesty, I knew I was a physician. I had some interest [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=261.04s)]
*  in science and I just wanted to explore it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you just went and that ecosystem has opened up a lot of doors, you know, in the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=271.36s)]
*  periphery in front of you, maybe in some cases behind you. And you've taken you've seemingly [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=276.16s)]
*  taken advantage of every door that's presented itself. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, to be fair, I have to tell you, the first three years were actually marked by a lot of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=284.8s)]
*  failure. And in fact, after three years there, I tried to get a cancer vaccine to work. I [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  actually proved why it didn't work. I tried to understand immunonecology. We had a theory [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=298.96s)]
*  as to what could be what are today called checkpoints. We actually debunked it and it [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=304.76s)]
*  wasn't that. And after kind of three years, I said, you know, I better go back and finish [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=309.84s)]
*  my clinical training. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  And it taught me the value of scientific depth. But I can tell you years later when I came [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=318.72s)]
*  upon a saying by the late Nelson Mandela, it's become my favorite quote of all time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=329.92s)]
*  And he said, in life, I've either succeeded or I've learned. To be fair, in those early [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=335.72s)]
*  days, I had a lot of learnings, still do to this day. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=341.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's a common refrain. But it's like there's a dichotomy. It's a common refrain, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=345.24s)]
*  but it's all too often forgotten in this industry. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, and I think we tend to just package it as well. That was a failure instead of a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=355.72s)]
*  learning. It's really just a terminology change. But reframing that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=359.8s)]
*  I do think that when things don't go as expected, that's actually when you grow and when you learn [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=366.92s)]
*  the most. In fact, in a roundabout way, and we'll come back to this later, one of the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=374.04s)]
*  fascinating things for me to reflect on COVID was here's something that succeeded beyond [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=380.68s)]
*  my wildest expectations. So, you know, what did I learn from that? Because there are learnings [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=385.56s)]
*  from that success, but it's actually, you know, maybe counterintuitively, it's easier [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=390.36s)]
*  to learn from failures than it is from successes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Sticking back in that timeframe, after you completed your residency at Temple and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=399.4s)]
*  your fellowship at Penn, you joined GSK to work in clinical development and translational [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=406.12s)]
*  medicine. So tell us why you made that transition to industry. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=411.08s)]
*  I have to say that was a completely non-obvious move to me at the time. I had spent many years [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=415.4s)]
*  in training in academia, you know, an internship, another internship, a residency, a postdoc, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=421.48s)]
*  a fellowship. And as I was finishing my fellowship, I actually won an ASCO Young [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=426.6s)]
*  Investigator Award. This thing handed out to fellows, you've got a little bit of research [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=435.16s)]
*  budget. And I came home really proud. My son was 12, looks up at me and says, Dad, what's all the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  commotion about? I was clearly excited. And I look at him and said, well, you know, I just won this [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=444.12s)]
*  Young Investigator Award. And the kid looks up at me and says, Dad, what do you mean, young [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=449.56s)]
*  investigator award? Like, how old are you? And I look at the kid and he had a point. You know, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=456.2s)]
*  I was in my 38, 39 and he's 12 and heading up to college in a few years. And here I am having fun [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=462.52s)]
*  training, learning, seeing patients, but it really kind of brought it home that, okay, maybe it's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  time to actually go do something in the world. And while I train myself thinking I was going to be an [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=476.28s)]
*  academic physician, I started my life actually as a pediatric intensive care unit nurse. And I [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=481.48s)]
*  worked as a nurse on that side of the patient's bed, if you will, as I was training to be a [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=486.76s)]
*  physician. And I always appreciated teamwork. And, you know, the academic world is driven by the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=491.56s)]
*  axiom that there can only be one first author. A few years before that, I interviewed at a very [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=501.48s)]
*  prestigious institution for fellowship. And they said, great, yeah, we'll have you as a fellow. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=507.96s)]
*  And with a little bit of chutzpah, I asked them, well, you know, if I come here as a fellow, how [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=513.56s)]
*  quickly can I be faculty? And they said, oh, okay, let's think about that. And they took it up the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=516.52s)]
*  flagpole and down came the answer. It said, look, we've looked at your resume. Yeah, you did a post [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  doc at the NIH. You had some papers. Great. But you actually had more second authorship than first [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=528.12s)]
*  authorship. So we're not really sure about you. And I have to tell you, I really took that to heart [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=533.96s)]
*  because I was actually more proud of the second authorship because when you're a second authorship, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  it means you got to be part of something. Somebody else did the work. You got to play a role in [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=543.64s)]
*  enjoying it, leading and thinking through it while you were doing other stuff as well. And so when [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=548.2800000000001s)]
*  the time came to sort of make the career move, the notion that I could actually go do it in a more [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=554.6s)]
*  team-based environment where really the purpose was getting better drugs, I just found that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=564.52s)]
*  appealing. And, you know, if you take a medicine and you open it up, you know, whether it's tabs [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=570.84s)]
*  or a vial, you'll see there's a piece of paper rolled up in that that most people throw away. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=577.96s)]
*  Well, if you open up that paper, it's actually the label. It's what the FDA says you should use it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=581.88s)]
*  And if you look at where, you know, who signed off on that label, where do these drugs come from? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=587.0s)]
*  Well, they don't come from the university and they don't come from the National Institutes of [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=591.48s)]
*  Health. They actually come from drug companies. And so if you, as your mission in life, want to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=594.84s)]
*  actually do better, especially in oncology with the state of affair of drugs, while we have very [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=600.12s)]
*  good drugs, we should and could do better. And you want to be part of that doing better [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=606.28s)]
*  then you go to where the action is. You go to where these medicines are made to have an impact. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=611.72s)]
*  And that's sort of what propelled me to, despite having trained for so long to be an academic [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=616.28s)]
*  physician, to actually shift gears and try it out in industry. Speaking of being in the place that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  makes the medicines, you continue to play your hand at a place that makes a lot of medicines in Teva. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=629.24s)]
*  So, Teva, you've been there since 2021 as a board member. It's one of the world's largest [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=636.12s)]
*  generics companies. Tell us about that experience and how it's informed your take on the market. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=641.24s)]
*  I have to tell you, I'm super proud of that. And I'm proud at a very deep level, because [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=649.96s)]
*  what Teva does is a reflection of the breadth of contribution to our industry that's often lost [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=656.52s)]
*  when we think of purely innovative companies. The innovation at the heart of the ecosystem is [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=663.24s)]
*  protected by intellectual property. And that is the engine that's allowed us to be so productive [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=670.04s)]
*  in the US in the last 50 years as the leaders of the world of therapeutic benefit. But the beauty is [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  that that contract with society actually plays out in the long run once the intellectual property [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=683.88s)]
*  expires and you now have generic medicines. And the stamp I take every morning and the fact that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=692.04s)]
*  my late father managed to live for 40 years with chronic heart disease and taking five, six, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=698.92s)]
*  seven different meds, those were all generics, or most of them were. And by now, all of them are. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=704.68s)]
*  And so the benefit of the previous era is now available to society at a fraction of the cost, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=710.52s)]
*  thanks to that. And in the discussion that we have about cost of drugs and intellectual property [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=716.84s)]
*  and all the other stuff, we often forget that there's a very long tail of benefit that we just [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=724.12s)]
*  keep raising the bar and then the price goes down years later for everybody to enjoy. And that's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=731.4s)]
*  worldwide. And so I take tremendous pride in Teva's contribution, both on the innovative side, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=736.52s)]
*  we are an innovative company, we do develop innovative medicines, but also on the generic [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=743.48s)]
*  underpinning of that, that provides drugs for hundreds of millions of people every day. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=748.6800000000001s)]
*  Freeze up, right? It frees up cost and money to be able to cover the innovative stuff, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=754.36s)]
*  the breaking new drugs on the market that aren't as cheap as generics or as biosimilars. So it's [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=761.32s)]
*  really, it pays into that innovation in its own way. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=767.64s)]
*  That's good. Yeah, it's a good illustration of Dr. Zaks's, I guess, the breadth of his portfolio, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=770.68s)]
*  right? Like the things, I mean, we're going to talk about Axelio here pretty soon, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=780.6s)]
*  doing some pretty novel and exciting things. And he did obviously some pretty novel and exciting [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=785.08s)]
*  things beginning in 2015, when he took on the stint as CMO at Moderna. So he could spend, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=790.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. I want to give this its fair share, but we could [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=797.32s)]
*  spend a couple episodes talking about stories from those Moderna days. The Moderna age. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=801.88s)]
*  You know, like not to put too fine a point on it, but you joined Moderna in 2015. Like, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=807.48s)]
*  just let that sink in for a minute. Tell us about that. Like you start, like was this, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=813.96s)]
*  was this a right place, right time kind of situation? Was it like you saw something [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=820.7600000000001s)]
*  coming? Like what's the story there? How were you reading the tea leaves? What was going on? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=825.48s)]
*  Oh, I wish I could be that smart. You know, I was listening to a podcast a few weeks ago. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=830.84s)]
*  General Petrus made a comment. He referenced the late, long late Roman philosopher Seneca, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=837.32s)]
*  who said that luck is when preparation meets opportunity. So in a way I was prepared. I had [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=845.08s)]
*  spent a significant chunk of my life by then in oncology drug development. As you mentioned, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=854.84s)]
*  I, you know, I started GSK, ended up running Santa Fe's global oncology team. And at that point, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=861.72s)]
*  I had sort of the opportunity to kind of look around at the biotech system and figure out, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=866.92s)]
*  well, what's new that's coming and what are some interesting ways to fill our pipeline. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=871.08s)]
*  And up until that point, I was a medical oncologist through and through. I cared about [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=878.12s)]
*  better medicines for cancer patients. I didn't care about where they were coming from. The proof [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=882.52s)]
*  point I actually spent a couple of years at Cephalon. Cephalon had developed two of the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  oldest poisons known to man as a very effective cancer chemotherapies. One is arsenic trioxide, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=891.72s)]
*  which cures a subset of leukemia. So fine by me, right? The clinical benefit is what is what [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=896.6s)]
*  speaks to me. But as you're a scientist and you get sort of curious about where's innovation [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=901.56s)]
*  coming from, I had the opportunity to look within the Boston ecosystem at a whole bunch of stuff. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=907.56s)]
*  I came upon Moderna and the idea of mRNA and it made me stop and sort of think differently [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=913.8s)]
*  about translating science into medicine. So by then I sort of realized that I was, my happy place, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=921.0799999999999s)]
*  if you will, is between the science and the medicine, not pure science for the sake of science, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=927.88s)]
*  not just pure medical practice, even though I did that a number of years as a volunteer at the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=933.32s)]
*  Philadelphia VA, but it's actually that in between. And Moderna was, had an emerging, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=937.6400000000001s)]
*  interesting idea and platform that was very orthogonal to my thinking. It was not, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=947.5600000000001s)]
*  hey, we have a cancer patient and cancer here as a need, can you make a medicine? It was, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=954.0400000000001s)]
*  we have this innovative idea of a new platform and if we can translate it into medicine, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=960.6s)]
*  what would those medicines be? And that's a very different way of asking the question. Now, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=966.76s)]
*  in full transparency in 2015, all the data we had were just an animal model and mice. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=972.52s)]
*  And most people thought this thing was never going to work. I have been fortunate in life that [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=980.0400000000001s)]
*  in that my wife, who's the smart one in the equation, actually has a PhD in biochemistry. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=986.0400000000001s)]
*  She looks at me and says, well, you know, it's all mRNA, it's high risk, but hey, if this speaks to [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=992.2800000000001s)]
*  you, go for it. And I was in a place in life where it was time to take risks, you know, and the way [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=996.9200000000001s)]
*  to think about it, I had a big birthday that year. And one of the things that happens when you reach [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1004.2800000000001s)]
*  a certain age is that you stop looking at the next career thing you're going to do. You start [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1010.36s)]
*  looking at time in reverse. You said, okay, and the time that left to me in this world, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1014.44s)]
*  what do I want to get done? What do I want to accomplish? And then you realize you'd rather [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1019.24s)]
*  fail or learn trying to address a big question than just do something small and incremental. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  This was a big question. This was a question that most people thought was not going to work. I mean, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1030.6000000000001s)]
*  I can show you nature papers back in the day referencing Moderna and Theranos in the same [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1036.6000000000001s)]
*  sentence for crying out loud. And it was a very different way to kind of challenge yourself to go [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1041.72s)]
*  make medicine. So I signed on because I thought that if this would work, we should be able to go [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1051.0s)]
*  from an idea on a whiteboard to a medicine being studied in man at a fraction of the time and the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1059.0s)]
*  cost of what traditional drug development takes. And it had such potential in terms of a platform [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1064.6s)]
*  that could lend itself to once you do the first one, the other ones should actually work that [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1073.32s)]
*  repeatability that is unheard of in traditional pharma. And in fact, we'd actually proven it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1078.6s)]
*  One of the things the public is not aware of is that, you know, the COVID vaccine was not [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1086.36s)]
*  Moderna's first vaccine. It was actually the ninth virus against which we tried to raise [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1091.16s)]
*  neutralizing antibodies in humans. And our success rate for the prior eight had been eight out of eight. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1095.96s)]
*  So COVID for us inside was not a surprise actually that it worked. There were a lot of other things [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1103.4s)]
*  surprising about it, but we knew this platform could actually get there. In fact, for years, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  we had been working with an urgency to get there in time. So I really like this point. You know, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1113.0s)]
*  when you joined Moderna, I think the instinct there was to really be part of a foundation, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1119.0s)]
*  right? You wanted to build the foundation for mRNA medicines and instead of making sort of [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1123.96s)]
*  incremental advancements, really try to develop this proof point for mRNA as an actual therapeutic, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1129.56s)]
*  as a vaccine candidate. But I'm really, I'm curious to learn more about, you know, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1135.88s)]
*  your priorities as a CMO stepping into a company at this time when mRNA was again, as you said, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1141.24s)]
*  compared to Theranos, right? Like it wasn't a household name. A lot of people were hesitant [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1147.56s)]
*  to believe that it would work. It was high risk. You know, what were your priorities as a CMO when [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1153.32s)]
*  you stepped into this company and in these early days, what did that look like and entail? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1158.9199999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of Moderna's success stems from two factors. The first is the courage that those that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1166.44s)]
*  came there before me, Stephane Boncelle, Stephen Hoag, to ask the question, don't, you know, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1175.16s)]
*  suspend disbelief. If it works, what can you do with it? And then the very thoughtful risk mitigation [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1183.0s)]
*  approach to try and take several shots on goal in different dimensions to try to work yourself [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  across different things that could work, but you don't know that they could. In those days, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1197.72s)]
*  they spanned infectious disease vaccines. They spanned oncology efforts. They spanned rare disease. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1202.28s)]
*  One of the things that I personally started shortly after joining was the personalized cancer [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1209.16s)]
*  vaccine. And, you know, we can come back to that, you know, if you want to cliffhanger into this [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1214.44s)]
*  episode, we can talk about cancer vaccines because it's a fascinating story. In fact, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1220.52s)]
*  it's much more fascinating to me scientifically than even COVID. But when I joined [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1225.0800000000002s)]
*  and this is where your popcorn will find a place. When I joined in March of 2015, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1231.88s)]
*  Stephane Boncelle, the CEO, asked me to give an all-employee town hall three months into my tenure. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1239.24s)]
*  So in June of 2015, and he wanted me to explain to the employees that were about 300 people at [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1246.36s)]
*  Moderna at the time, why was it that a unicorn on paper company in Boston, so secretive, is actually [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1252.52s)]
*  the first clinical trial is going to be a vaccine against a pandemic flu threat out of China. That [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1260.68s)]
*  was our first phase one. We started at the end of 2015. And so what we did back in those days is we [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1266.76s)]
*  used to rent the auditorium next door. It was actually a movie theater, the Kendall Square Theater. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1271.3200000000002s)]
*  We used to rent it out for random Thursday afternoon. We'd give all the employees free popcorn. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1279.16s)]
*  They'd sit when the executives would get on stage and, you know, tell the story of what the company [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1283.0800000000002s)]
*  was up to in the last couple of months. And so it's my turn, June of 2015, and I told Stephane, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1287.8s)]
*  great, we're in a movie theater. I'm going to take some license with my presentation. I'm not [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1292.2s)]
*  going to use your usual slide template. I'm going to make believe we're in a movie. And so I get up, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1295.72s)]
*  everybody's with popcorn. I'm the new CMO. I said, guys, pretend this is a movie. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1302.36s)]
*  The theater goes dark and on the screen comes a slide and the title of the movie is How Moderna [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1308.44s)]
*  Will Save the World. June of 2015, the next slide is a PG-13 green rated thing, right, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1313.88s)]
*  to get everybody. And then the rest of the presentation started with the Spanish flu in [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1320.68s)]
*  1918, goes through the fact that still back then in 2015, we don't have a good vaccine response. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1325.48s)]
*  We don't have good antivirals. All we have is these masks, these picture of people walking [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1331.88s)]
*  around in masks. And I flashed those pictures up in June of 2015. And basically the gist of the talk [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1337.3200000000002s)]
*  was our platform. It's clear the low hanging fruit is going to be vaccines for a whole host [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1343.0s)]
*  of technical reasons. And we owe it to ourselves, to the company, to society to make sure that we're [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1348.2s)]
*  advancing these vaccines, both those that are of perceived commercial value and those that could be [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1353.88s)]
*  of public benefit. And in fact, that's what we proceeded to do. We had advanced a few candidates [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1360.68s)]
*  that have commercial background. I mean, CMV right now is already in phase three there. But [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1366.92s)]
*  in parallel, we worked on flu. We worked on Zika in 2017. That's when part of the US government got [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1373.24s)]
*  to go. And we built this track record of the ability of this platform to actually execute [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1378.28s)]
*  towards a pandemic need. And I'll tell you, it came full circle in September of 2019. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1386.04s)]
*  Stefan and I went down for our sort of annual meeting with the NHFO. Tony Fauci was there at [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1396.1200000000001s)]
*  the time. And they got to know us through the Zika pandemic in 2017. And we started to collaborate. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1402.68s)]
*  And by then we had shown that the mRNA vaccine could actually work to protect an animal model of [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1408.52s)]
*  a cousin of COVID called MERS. And we were telling the team there about the most recent data we had. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1414.1200000000001s)]
*  And I remember at some point, Dr. Fauci kind of stopped me and said, so are you telling me this is [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1421.72s)]
*  the best vaccine platform I've ever seen? And me being me, I basically looked at them, Dr. Fauci, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1426.6000000000001s)]
*  yes. And let me explain why. And so the upshot of that meeting was actually that Moderna and the NIH [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1434.68s)]
*  were going to form a collaboration to pick a virus, something nobody ever heard of, will just send [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1442.3600000000001s)]
*  you the sequence. You guys can start the clock, see how fast you can make a first batch and we'll [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1450.68s)]
*  run the phase one clinical trial. And in November, the NIH, November of 2019, Dr. Fauci actually [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1454.92s)]
*  published a paper talking about pandemic preparedness of various platforms and mentions mRNA there as [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1464.04s)]
*  the leading platform ready to serve in a pandemic, whether it's influenza or a related respiratory [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1469.64s)]
*  virus. And as we were talking to the NIH, trying to figure out what would be that test case, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1475.64s)]
*  somebody started coughing into Wuhan and the rest is history. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1481.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1484.3600000000001s)]
*  You realize how much fodder you're providing for conspiracy theorists right now, Dr. Zaks. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1486.1200000000001s)]
*  Really takes story time to a whole new level. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1494.5200000000002s)]
*  Where's my popcorn? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1498.0400000000002s)]
*  I know. But I'm curious. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1499.16s)]
*  I can tell you just to finish the note, because I have to say, you know, I got to know all sorts [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1501.64s)]
*  of conspiracy theorists back in 2020. And one of my, I think, learnings from the whole era was [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1507.8s)]
*  how critical it is that we build public trust and understanding and what it is we do. If we do [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1517.0s)]
*  everything we do in translating science into medicine, but the public doesn't trust it, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1527.24s)]
*  then it will have been for naught. And I spent a lot of energy as the chief medical officer [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1532.04s)]
*  back in those days. And I still believe it's part of each and every one of our ethical obligation [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1536.68s)]
*  to be out there, to tell the story, to explain to people, where does this stuff come from? This is [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1543.8s)]
*  not black voodoo. This is not some magic mystery. This is people hard at work trying to understand [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1548.04s)]
*  the science and trying to translate that science. And we did a couple of things that I'm really [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1553.56s)]
*  proud of back in that era. The first was as the phase three trial was going on, I remember being [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1560.2s)]
*  on a webinar with the National Academy of Sciences of New York State. And they asked me, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1568.6s)]
*  okay, at the end of it, there was a Q&A that said, Dr. Zaks, what are you worried about? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1573.6399999999999s)]
*  And they expected me to say, oh, I don't know if this is going to work. And the other said, look, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1578.2s)]
*  I'm not worried about safety. I'm not worried about efficacy. The one thing that keeps me up at night [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1581.96s)]
*  is that our trial enrolls people of diverse enough representation of the great country of ours, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1585.96s)]
*  so that when the data comes out, people can relate to the veracity of those data and can see themselves [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1593.64s)]
*  in the trial. And I think Moderna went on to really pioneer enrollment of diverse populations [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1600.1200000000001s)]
*  in phase three and in all subsequent trials, partnering with both national and regional [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1605.88s)]
*  experts and leaders of the community to make sure that clinical research is both accessible [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1611.56s)]
*  to everybody and representative of everybody. And the other interesting thing was, again, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1617.56s)]
*  as I was thinking, how do we relay this message to the public? I actually convened a small ethics [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1624.52s)]
*  panel for the executive team at Moderna. You're not going to find this on any website. This was [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1632.52s)]
*  not done for external consumption. This was really to get external advice of people like Art [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1637.8s)]
*  Kaplan and other experts in ethics on how should we be thinking about our protocol. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1642.76s)]
*  And one of the experts there, a friend of mine, Anne Beale, Anne is a wonderful black pediatrician [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1647.8s)]
*  from New York City. She was the first chief patient safety chief patient officer at Danofi. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1653.8s)]
*  She's today on the board of GSK. And I brought in Anne and Anne looks at me and says, Paul, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1659.3999999999999s)]
*  I've been in your shoes. The only way you can do this is to be transparent to the point of [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1664.44s)]
*  discomfort. And I listened and I said, that's going to be the motto of our medical affairs [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1669.88s)]
*  organization. And in the ensuing weeks, we had a lot of internal conversation. I was pushing to [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1675.88s)]
*  have the phase three protocol of the COVID vaccine actually published. And companies don't usually [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1682.1200000000001s)]
*  publish protocols on the web, certainly not unredacted and certainly not as the trial is [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1688.84s)]
*  still ongoing. And we finally prevailed. And in September we went out and we put the entire [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1694.36s)]
*  protocol on the web. And I'm very happy to say that all the pharma followed suit, some of them [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1700.84s)]
*  within hours. We got one of the most favorable articles ever written on pharma on the New York [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1706.36s)]
*  Times in September of 2020. But more importantly, journalists who used to call me up in those days [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1710.9199999999998s)]
*  and say, Hey, you know, what are you not telling me? How many patients are you going to see, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1717.88s)]
*  et cetera? Suddenly the conversation was tall on page 87 paragraph two of your protocol. Can [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1723.24s)]
*  you explain to me how the power of the statistics work? Right. So you could actually take now the [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1729.24s)]
*  conversation with the public. And I, you know, I have tremendous respect for to journalists [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1734.0400000000002s)]
*  because at the end of the day, you're the ones who translate this to what the public actually [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1739.0800000000002s)]
*  gets to listen and figure out. And so it changed the dialogue that we had with the public on what [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1744.28s)]
*  that protocol was actually trying to do. He says, he says one of the most favorable articles [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1753.08s)]
*  on pharma, the New York Times is the, I'm thinking like a favorable article on pharma is a win. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1760.12s)]
*  And it doesn't have to be one of the most, right? I mean, if it's, if it's anyone is a win, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1764.76s)]
*  if it's 52% favorable, that's a win. No, I really, you know, so I think you kind of answered this, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1770.3600000000001s)]
*  this question that I have, but so, you know, you built this foundation, you weren't concerned [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1777.48s)]
*  necessarily about mRNA being efficacious and safe. The big priority for you as the pandemic [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1781.72s)]
*  started to hit in the, in the year after, right, as you released your vaccine was really making sure [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1789.32s)]
*  that you were telling the full story and that everyone who needed to and wanted to see that [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1795.24s)]
*  data could actually access it and be able to understand that story. You know, was that perhaps [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1800.52s)]
*  the biggest part of your leadership at that time as a CMO in an mRNA company, once it kind of became [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1806.84s)]
*  a public good, right? A publicly known household name, or how did you see your priorities sort of [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1813.8s)]
*  shifting as mRNA suddenly became an actual medicine that was commercialized and you had [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1820.36s)]
*  to continue moving forward and being a CMO of this company? Yeah, I think that's true. If you, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1826.9199999999998s)]
*  if I look back at 2020 and now, you know, with the wisdom of hindsight, it really is, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1836.28s)]
*  there's two parts to that year. And the first part, when we sort of had to muster up and figure out [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1843.0s)]
*  how to get this done and how to do it in a way that would avoid all the obvious pitfalls. And [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1848.9199999999998s)]
*  by the way, how to do it while learning to work in a completely novel manner. That was all consuming. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1856.52s)]
*  I mean, if you would have told me in 2019 that I'd be developing a vaccine in 2020 and I'd be doing [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1863.72s)]
*  it with a team of dozens of people, all of whom I had hired through Zoom and never met. And I would [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1868.28s)]
*  be doing it with three government agencies who had to align on protocols and endpoints, none of [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1876.76s)]
*  whom got in the room together with each other, let alone me. And I do it in record time such that we [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1882.76s)]
*  went from an idea and a whiteboard to an authorized vaccine in 11 months, I would have thought, yeah, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1889.8799999999999s)]
*  that's impossible. And yet we did it. And so that's where you kind of, there's learnings [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1895.56s)]
*  from that success in terms of how we work across individuals and what can work with remote working [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1903.0s)]
*  in Zoom and what actually takes people to get in the room together to align on things. And I think [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1911.96s)]
*  we as a society are still learning that lesson, but it's clearly, I think for us, the development [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1917.08s)]
*  of the vaccine was probably a unique edge case that everybody else experienced in terms of what [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1922.92s)]
*  can you get done remotely and how to go about building an effective remote working environment. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1929.48s)]
*  The second half of the year, I think once the phase three was sort of rolling on its tracks, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1937.0s)]
*  and then I had to pay attention to two things. I think one of them is, as you said, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1944.04s)]
*  being the public face, making sure that I can tell the story, that I can represent Moderna. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1951.64s)]
*  We had very critical FDA meetings, advisory committee meetings, CDC meetings, et cetera. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1959.24s)]
*  The other one that is a story that's not often told actually has to do with safety. And what people [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1966.04s)]
*  sort of don't realize is, and probably this is a good explanation for some of the conspiracy [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1975.8s)]
*  theorists out there, the mRNA vaccines are the most intensively studied from a safety perspective [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1983.32s)]
*  medical intervention in the history of humanity. We have dosed, I don't know, one, two billion [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1992.12s)]
*  people with these medicines. We've done it with the most modern tools for data collection ever [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=1998.36s)]
*  available to mankind. We've done it with reporting through all forms of modern communication [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2004.04s)]
*  technology. We've done it using the best tools available today of big data analyses [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2011.64s)]
*  for any kind of signal. And the proof is that when you had very rare adverse events that happen at [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2017.8000000000002s)]
*  a rate of one to 150 or one to 200,000 cases, those were picked up within months. And that's [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2025.64s)]
*  what happened to the AstraZeneca vaccine, the J&J vaccine, if you recall back. And even Moderna had [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2033.96s)]
*  this very low signal of the myocarditis that had been picked up and then validated. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2041.88s)]
*  So I don't think there's anything significant about the safety of these vaccines that we don't know. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2048.44s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense given the way we collect it. And I can tell you the amount of [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2056.12s)]
*  man hours, hundreds of millions that it actually costs to collect the safety data, that is the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2060.44s)]
*  iceberg under the water. And to the degree that I was sort of steering the ship in those days, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2066.76s)]
*  that was the thing that I had to pay careful attention to, to make sure that we are actually [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2073.88s)]
*  collecting the data as required by regulations. And by the way, global regulators around the [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2081.2400000000002s)]
*  world would have weekly teleconferences without me, FDA, the Europeans, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2087.4s)]
*  And they would be talking about the safety of our vaccines and what it is that they get direct [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2093.88s)]
*  reporting. And when you think about it, just to give you a numbers on it, when we started down [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2097.8s)]
*  this path, we took a look at the previous vaccines launched and we thought that we would get about [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2103.8s)]
*  three to four times the reporting of adverse events that any other vaccine would happen. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2110.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what we geared up to. When it actually got rolled out, we got about 15 folds. I mean, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2116.6s)]
*  I don't remember the exact numbers, but it was over a 10 fold what we had expected because of [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2122.68s)]
*  this heightened sense of vigilance, because of the public scrutiny and all rightly so. And it was our [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2127.56s)]
*  job to react to that, collect the data, sift through it and make sure that we reported accurately. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2133.56s)]
*  And so that's the story that's not often told, but for me was critical so that I can be out there [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2138.6s)]
*  and say, yep, you know, if you want to know what the side effects are, you remember that FDA label, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2145.24s)]
*  go back and pull it up. Because if there's anything we saw by law, it's on there. And [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2150.52s)]
*  we're having those conversations with the FDA to tell them about it. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2156.12s)]
*  Scott Gottlieb Yeah. You know, very few, it occurs to me, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2158.84s)]
*  the very few, very few CXOs in a similar, we'll ever find themselves in a similar position where [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2162.2s)]
*  that one moment, moment in time, you know, really throws the afterburners of your career [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2171.24s)]
*  on, right? Like, very few people are going to see that. And fewer still, fewer still people are [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2177.88s)]
*  going to survive it, come out the other end, like, you know, hey, the contribution there. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2184.04s)]
*  Maura Vaughn Yeah, I stand on it. So, you know, it goes without saying that that had to have been [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2188.76s)]
*  a supreme confidence builder, even in your already very successful and advanced career, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2196.2000000000003s)]
*  that had to be a supreme confidence builder. But, and as I said, we could talk about COVID for like [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2202.04s)]
*  the next three hours. But I want to, I want to kind of shift back to like, what makes Dr. Talzachs [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2207.4s)]
*  who he is today, and kind of keeps him moving forward. So taking sort of that specific [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2215.32s)]
*  experience off the table, what other inflection points during your, you know, CXO, VP, even [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2221.7200000000003s)]
*  research experiences with your previous companies have in a similar, but maybe more muted to the [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2228.2000000000003s)]
*  public way, influenced your confidence in your career trajectory, you know, your decisions to go [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2235.96s)]
*  on and be a, be a board guy, be a founder, be a, you know, the leader of Exilio, for instance, now. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2244.68s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly Pretty big open-ended. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2252.68s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly Yeah, it's a combination of factors. You know, it starts with the [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2256.68s)]
*  absolute joy of seeing clinical benefit come at the other end. I'll tell you a story back when I was [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2263.7200000000003s)]
*  at Sanofi, we had a drug that was in phase one, just the first, first phase of clinical research. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2271.56s)]
*  And it was, it was, it targets something called CD38 for patients with a type of blood cancer [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2278.6000000000004s)]
*  called multiple myeloma. And this phase one had been going on for very long because we started [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2288.2s)]
*  at very low doses. We were going very, very slowly and it wasn't clear that it was going to work. So [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2293.3999999999996s)]
*  people weren't excited to enroll. And one day the team comes back and tells me, you know, you [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2298.52s)]
*  remember that 70 year old patient that we had, and he'd just gotten a couple of doses. Well, he, he, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2302.9199999999996s)]
*  he decided to go off protocol and he's no longer participating. I'm like, why, you know, we just [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2308.7599999999998s)]
*  lost a data point. It's, this is hard enough as it is. And they say, well, you know, here's what [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2314.68s)]
*  happened. We gave him two doses or three doses of the drug. He went into a complete response. He's [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2319.96s)]
*  70 year old. He's been feeling like crap for the last decade of his life. He finally got the [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2324.7599999999998s)]
*  opportunity to go to Europe and take the summer off and do that trip. He's been dreaming up. So [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2329.56s)]
*  he decided he's not coming for his next dose. He's going off to Europe to live. Right. And then you go, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2334.12s)]
*  okay. I guess, I guess that's okay. That's what we strive for, right. Improve quality of life. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2340.04s)]
*  So, so, so those stories that, that you sort of, that you live for on the, you know, I think I've [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2348.2799999999997s)]
*  been fortunate to, to have mentors and colleagues to be able to talk to and have, have sort of [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2356.2799999999997s)]
*  steered me right, whether it's people like Steve Rosenberg, who, who is still there at the NCI [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2364.68s)]
*  now 50 years as the towering modern giant father of, you know, oncology. I mean, a lot of therapies [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2371.48s)]
*  we see today, the T cell therapies all started in his lab back in the day. I've been fortunate to [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2379.48s)]
*  have a supportive wife who understands what I do. And, and, and more than that will actually [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2387.08s)]
*  tell me to my face when, when I'm talking nonsense and telling me the stuff I don't want to hear. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2392.44s)]
*  And, and I've been blessed with having colleagues, you know, one of the privileges that we have in [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2399.0s)]
*  the world and this ecosystem is that the end game is something tangible that is easy to be passionate [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2406.52s)]
*  about. We're not making widgets. We're making people feel better, live longer. We're trying to [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2413.48s)]
*  cure diseases. We're trying to prevent horrible illnesses. It is easy to get that as a rallying [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2418.68s)]
*  cry. What's hard is then to figure out, okay, with all the unknowns in biology along the way, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2426.2799999999997s)]
*  how do you do that? Now in the, I think this, in, in this phase of my career, one of the things I [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2432.2s)]
*  learned at Moderna sort of through doing is the importance of aligning return on investment with [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2440.8399999999997s)]
*  with kind of innovation and doing good for patients. And it sounds trite, but it's actually [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2449.08s)]
*  not obvious and it's not trivial to get right. The, our ecosystem has been so productive, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2455.64s)]
*  but you have to understand the drivers of this ecosystem, because if you look at other economic [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2464.6s)]
*  models of trying to translate innovation into healthcare benefits, they have not worked nearly [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2471.08s)]
*  as well. And so I judge it by the results and I am deeply respectful of the underlying [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2477.32s)]
*  economic ecosystem that rewards innovation and rewards investment in high risk areas with return [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2486.36s)]
*  on that investment. You know, I was, I was kindly invited to a recent summit that one of the National [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2496.2000000000003s)]
*  Academy of Sciences Medicine and Engineering had about how to better align investing in innovation [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2504.6s)]
*  and therapeutics with unmet need. And, and one of my points to them was I, I'm not ashamed of saying [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2511.48s)]
*  return on investment. When we talk about drug pricing, you know, we, we, we often talk about [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2520.36s)]
*  kind of reimbursement and reimbursement is a term that is fit for when I go out and have a meal and [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2529.32s)]
*  I need somebody to pay for the meal. We don't work for reimbursement. Let's be fair. We work for a [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2536.1200000000003s)]
*  return on the investment. My shareholders, my limited partners right now in venture, a lot of [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2542.44s)]
*  them are pension funds. They give me a pot of money. Seven years later, I need to give them a [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2548.2000000000003s)]
*  bigger pot of money back because they got to go pay those pensions. That's what propels our system. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2552.1200000000003s)]
*  That is commercial investment. And for me, since I was fortunate to never actually do anything [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2557.16s)]
*  strictly for money, I became super curious to understand and immerse myself in an ecosystem [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2565.0s)]
*  where that part of the value is actually a very objective and legitimate yardstick. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2573.16s)]
*  You know, sweat equity and capital equity tend to be rewarded differently. I've sort of lived [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2580.2799999999997s)]
*  now through both. And when, when investors at Moderna used to ask me, well, you know, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2585.08s)]
*  what's the stock price? Should I invest? Is it too high? Is it too low? What's it going to? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2591.0s)]
*  I used to look at them and say, look, you can do what you want with your money. I'm actually [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2595.0s)]
*  investing something much more valuable than money at Moderna. And that's my time on earth. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2599.08s)]
*  So you be the judge of your money. I think sweat equity and capital equity are different. And these [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2605.0s)]
*  days I'm curious to immerse myself in this side of the business of biotech, if I may, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2609.56s)]
*  to understand what that return on investment looks like and how do I best align it with the [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2615.7999999999997s)]
*  things that I still inherently care about, which is translating science into medicine. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2621.32s)]
*  Scott Mulder Yeah. Yeah. In that vein, I mean, one of the first questions that investors ask, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2626.2799999999997s)]
*  one of the first questions that regulatory agencies ask when they're looking at [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2631.72s)]
*  investigational therapeutics is about unmet medical needs. You know, what does it address? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2636.6s)]
*  Lots of research in biotech builders thus go about their business searching for solutions to unmet [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2642.92s)]
*  medical needs. Why not? It potentially wins the favor of markets and agencies. But you, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2649.16s)]
*  on the other hand, have shared somewhat, you know, face value, perhaps contrarian opinion that [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2656.6s)]
*  unmet medical need is not really what drives innovation in this industry. I guess I'd ask [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2661.96s)]
*  you for some explanation of that philosophy. Melissa Avery [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2670.6s)]
*  Explain yourself. Richard Lepore [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2673.48s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, it struck me as I was starting out at GSK, I remember at one point [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2676.28s)]
*  we said, okay, we're going to focus on lung cancer because it's an unmet need. And being the flippant [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2690.2s)]
*  young guy that I was, I told the head of the division that actually if he wanted to have an [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2695.96s)]
*  impact on lung cancer, he didn't need to do much work. GSK already had the best drug in their [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2700.2799999999997s)]
*  portfolio at the time. And he goes, yeah, what is it? Said it's Nicorette. Unmet need hasn't [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2704.2799999999997s)]
*  changed. And so we've had, you know, we've had cancer for eons. And so it's not unmet need per [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2711.7999999999997s)]
*  se that's driven all the new medicines we have. So it's actually new understandings in science [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2717.88s)]
*  and technology that then that are driven primarily by curiosity. You know, when Kaitlin Kuriko, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2727.1600000000003s)]
*  whom I have a ton of respect for, started fiddling around with the structure of RNA to understand [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2735.08s)]
*  why in some cases was it killing cells and what could she do to the chemistry to stop it from [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2740.36s)]
*  killing cells and get pro gene expressed. He came upon a really interesting discovery, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2744.2s)]
*  but nobody knew what to do with it. In fact, the IP lay fallow for years. They kind of licensed [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2751.7999999999997s)]
*  it to somebody else. And, and, and it wasn't until people who actually said, huh, there's something [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2756.04s)]
*  that maybe we can get translated. And even then the first folks who picked that up, their idea [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2763.96s)]
*  of what to do with it was just following their curiosity. Oh, can I reprogram the stem cell to [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2771.56s)]
*  go be something else, which is super interesting scientifically, but we still don't know how to [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2776.68s)]
*  make a medicine out of it. And so for me, that bit of translation in the middle, pure innovation is, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2781.56s)]
*  opens up the potential. That's the curiosity driven. That's basic science. That's basic [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2790.2799999999997s)]
*  technology. When Bob Langer discovered that he could make lipid nanoparticles, and Bob is [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2794.7599999999998s)]
*  a legendary MIT professor who's the father of the modern lipid nanoparticle. And frankly, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2800.68s)]
*  one of the fathers of the current ecosystem as we know it, Boston biotech. And that's because of his [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2806.2s)]
*  deep understanding that when he discovered he could do something and that something was, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2812.2s)]
*  everybody else thought he couldn't do it and shouldn't be possible. That opened up a wonderful [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2817.3199999999997s)]
*  world of intellectual property and that until then his understanding of the value of intellectual [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2822.3599999999997s)]
*  property and the ability then to showcase what you could do with it to attract investment. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2827.56s)]
*  That's what started the ball rolling. And frankly, Moderna is sort of the culmination of [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2833.0s)]
*  the curiosity of people like Bob Langer, like Hakelin Kuriko, but actually putting it together [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2839.88s)]
*  in something that now is useful. And in fact, even in the early days of Moderna, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2845.32s)]
*  we were exploring a whole bunch of different things and trying to make different types of [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2849.48s)]
*  therapies with it. Moderna still is exploring the next frontier, whether cystic fibrosis or rare [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2853.64s)]
*  disease. Now we know vaccines work. And what happens is unmet need becomes the prison by which [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2859.72s)]
*  you focus the light. It's not the source of light. The source of the energy is actually that scientific [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2866.44s)]
*  and technical innovation. And that's brilliant people who just are just super curious to go [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2874.04s)]
*  to go do something or investigate something. But the ability to then focus that potential through [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2880.2s)]
*  the prism of unmet need is what gets us medicine. I think that's a really interesting distinction, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2888.6s)]
*  especially given where we are right now, I think with mRNA and you're positioning yourself right [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2893.56s)]
*  at the head of a brand new mRNA company, right? So, you know, there are still so much [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2898.52s)]
*  unknown unknowns right around the science of mRNA and how it works and the delivery of it and how [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2904.36s)]
*  it's going to perform in different cell types and how we get it to express longer. There's so many [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2913.1600000000003s)]
*  different scientific questions. And we also tend to, I think, celebrate mRNA at face value for the [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2917.96s)]
*  ability to manufacture more efficiently. You've talked about this in comparison to other cell-based [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2924.76s)]
*  medicines, right? So, you know, I'd be curious to get your sense on the trajectory of innovation [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2930.2799999999997s)]
*  in this space. What you really think are some of the pieces here that are really driving [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2938.2s)]
*  further innovation in that space, right? And that we are starting to funnel into unmet need to some [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2943.8799999999997s)]
*  extent to make these into therapies. But what are those, you know, what's stoking the innovation [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2949.3199999999997s)]
*  in the mRNA space today that has you the most excited and what's at the root of that? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2955.8s)]
*  So, I think the two current frontiers for mRNA medicines have to do still with the original [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2962.6000000000004s)]
*  questions in a way, except we've moved the ball down the field. The first is, what cell can you [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2971.0800000000004s)]
*  get the mRNA into to mediate the protein translation that would lead to a therapeutic benefit? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2978.36s)]
*  Vaccines were the low-hanging fruit because all you need is a needle in the arm and it goes to [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2986.1200000000003s)]
*  the local lymph nodes and all you need is a smidgen of protein produced and you mimic a [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2991.0s)]
*  viral infection and off you go. The next place where you can put it is likely intravenous, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=2995.7200000000003s)]
*  and I think that's also been proven. We've demonstrated, we at Moderna back in the day [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3003.0s)]
*  shown that we can inject mRNA encoding just for an antibody intravenously and it goes to the liver [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3010.8399999999997s)]
*  and it will make you antibody and you get therapeutic doses of antibody. So, can you get it [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3016.44s)]
*  to the lungs? Can you get it to the bone marrow? Can you get lipid nanoparticles into immune cells? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3022.6s)]
*  Can you get that into the brain? I think that's some of the, those are some of the frontier areas [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3028.44s)]
*  where people are trying to push the boundaries. The next, the other dimension is, well, what [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3035.48s)]
*  actually can you encode in the mRNA? And initially, the place you start is the stuff that's best [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3043.48s)]
*  understood because you want to minimize risk and nothing is better understood than an antigen for a [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3051.32s)]
*  virus. And you know, it's no mistake that all the COVID vaccines all use the exact same spike protein [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3055.64s)]
*  that everybody now, you know, knows what a spike protein is. Okay, that was easy. But you could [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3061.48s)]
*  actually make proteins that are much more complicated. You can make proteins that require [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3066.6s)]
*  several subunits to come together and you can make proteins that have not been seen in nature. You [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3073.2400000000002s)]
*  can invent new proteins that have novel functions or improve on functions in very creative ways. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3077.72s)]
*  I am curious about that frontier personally. That's where Exilio comes in because for me, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3085.96s)]
*  Exilio, this gene therapy company that I've now taken on is actually at the forefront. It can [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3093.4s)]
*  combine innovation that comes from two different sources. One of them is mRNA and a lipid nanoparticle [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3102.6000000000004s)]
*  as a drug format. We can give it, it can go to cells where we understand it can already go to, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3109.0s)]
*  whether it's the liver or immune cells, and it can translate protein. And you can actually give [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3114.28s)]
*  it repeatedly. You can give it once, twice, three times. In fact, you know, Moderna and their lead [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3118.76s)]
*  indications have gone now for about a year in their first two diseases, giving it every two to [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3123.32s)]
*  three weeks. No problem. But the second thing is gene therapy. Can I actually integrate a novel [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3128.6000000000004s)]
*  piece of genetic material in a safe way into the human genome to produce a therapeutic protein [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3136.28s)]
*  and then I don't have to keep treating that patient? Well, that's as close to a cure as I know. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3144.44s)]
*  And so what this company that I'm now running is trying to do is basically take a page of evolution [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3151.5600000000004s)]
*  as a starting point of some elements that can actually do this in nature, but use modern tools [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3158.76s)]
*  of protein engineering to improve upon their utility so that we can actually use mRNA and [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3164.0400000000004s)]
*  lipid nanoparticle as a way to bring gene therapy to the forefront and do it not just by doing one [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3170.6s)]
*  or two small alterations of a genome, but actually to insert an entire piece of missing genetic [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3178.04s)]
*  material and cure a kid with a genetic disease, for example. And this, my friend, is where the [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3185.16s)]
*  cliffhanger comes in because we do have a hard stop. We do. And because my next series of questions, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3192.68s)]
*  we certainly cannot tackle in four minutes. We cannot. Those questions, those questions being, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3200.2s)]
*  if curiosity is to be rewarded, it must be funded. Who is funding curiosity? Who's willing to fund? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3206.12s)]
*  Who's willing to fund these innovations? Come on, in this market? Who's going to fund? We're going [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3212.8399999999997s)]
*  to go down that path. We're going to get to know Exilio in detail, but we're not going to do it [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3219.3199999999997s)]
*  right now, folks. We're going to do it in part two of this conversation that I am hereby [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3224.7599999999998s)]

*  With pleasure, colleagues. And we will have popcorn for that one. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKVEWflf4N8&t=3237.48s)]
