Video Description: Back by popular demand, biopharma industry opinionator extraordinaire Allan Shaw rejoins the Business of Biotech to expose the murky role Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) play in the last, costly mile of the drug distribution supply chain. Allan pulls no punches in his criticism of the current rebate structure and shares why the model leaves patients and manufacturers stuck with the spiraling tab. He also explains why an election year, all-time lows in public perception of the pharmaceutical industry, and inflation might create the perfect storm for real change. More than a gripe session, Allan offers up advice for biotech leaders entering the fray, shares his own ideas for systemic reform that would reward patients, not PBMs, and waxes on what, and who, it might take to change the broken paradigm.

*  Our friend and celebrated biopharma opinionator, Alan Shaw, says the last mile of the supply chain, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=40.0s)]
*  the part that gets therapies too, and indeed into patients, is twisted and broken. That incentives [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=47.28s)]
*  work for all the wrong players, and that patients, physicians, pharmaceutical developers, payers, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=54.4s)]
*  and virtually everyone except the PBMs are getting short shrift as a result. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=59.76s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business of Biotech, and on today's show, Alan and I are back together [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  to plane over the business of drug distribution, what's broken, how it might get fixed, and the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=70.0s)]
*  signs on the not-too-distant horizon that tell us the time for reform just might be nigh. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=76.32s)]
*  Alan, good to see you again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=82.72s)]
*  Great to see you, Matt, and thanks for having me back. Always a pleasure to be with you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  It always is. I'm always happy to have you back, and I always look forward to these conversations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=91.44s)]
*  And this one is a little bit outside of the wheelhouse of where we usually dwell, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=96.8s)]
*  but nonetheless important. I've had multiple conversations recently with biotechs that are [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=102.0s)]
*  in pre-commercialization mode. That means they're in pre-drug distribution mode. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=108.64s)]
*  So this concept, this discussion that we're going to have about the way the drugs are distributed, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=113.68s)]
*  who's rewarded, compliance to drugs and therapies and better outcomes, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=118.48s)]
*  it's absolutely relevant to our audience, I think. And you and I had a brief conversation [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  about this a week or so ago, and I think there are some movements in play that might be cracking [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=131.28s)]
*  the door open to sort of change the paradigm. So I'm going to get your thoughts on that, but [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=136.96s)]
*  to sort of get a level set heading into the conversation, I'm curious if you can just [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=142.88s)]
*  expand for us a little bit at the high level on what you mean when you talk about this convoluted [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=149.36s)]
*  last mile of the pharmaceutical supply chain and how it works today and where you see broken links. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=157.36s)]
*  No, thanks, Matt. I would start off by, it's kind of like the elephant in the room, and it's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=164.56s)]
*  something that's fortunately, I think the elephant is starting to be noticed. Given the sheer [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=175.76s)]
*  magnitude of the financial stakes, it's not surprising a cottage industry was created which [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=180.56s)]
*  feasts on the inefficiencies and a Byzantine relationships embedded in the opaque bioformer [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=186.16s)]
*  supply chain, with high gross to net margins, never been greater, almost 50% or higher, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=192.16s)]
*  that neither benefit the patient or the innovative drug manufacturer. And it's estimated to be [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=200.48s)]
*  approximately $250 billion on the table annually. And only the middlemen, otherwise known as the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=205.92s)]
*  PBMs, PBMs win. And they do this by extorting ever-increasing rebates and discounts in exchange for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=212.88s)]
*  favorable formulary positions. It's been this way for quite a while. What are your thoughts on, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=220.08s)]
*  how long has sort of the model that we're looking at right now that we see is problematic been [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  in play? You know, it has been a problem for a long time, and it continues to be a problem. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  As I like to quip, if you make a wrong turn and you keep going down the road, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  it's still a wrong turn. And I think it's time to get back on the road. And this is no different. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=247.6s)]
*  With so much value being lost or redirected, particularly in a pricing environment that's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=255.12s)]
*  being challenged by gravitational forces reflecting the current system, which is [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=261.52s)]
*  apparently and increasingly unsustainable. And actually, while this is all negative, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  it can actually, if you look at it through another lens, it can actually provide an [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=275.6s)]
*  opportunity for the industry to start rehabilitating its image. Instead of trying to raise drug prices, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=281.52s)]
*  it isn't a time to start exploring ways to extend the commercial supply chain, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=289.6s)]
*  to better engage with patients and advance commercial goals while squeezing out the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=295.04s)]
*  vast waste of legacy business practices. Yeah. Why do you think this is a good time [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=300.16s)]
*  to be having this conversation? You know, I mean, not that there's ever a bad time to have [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  a conversation about things that aren't working right, right. But, you know, I sense that there are [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=317.36s)]
*  dynamics that make this a more timely conversation than perhaps it might have been a couple of years [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=324.16s)]
*  ago. You know, I think, you know, we've been hit in the head so many times as an industry. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=329.44s)]
*  You know, I think people are starting to understand that we're not the only ones who [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=338.24s)]
*  should be getting hit in the head is one. You know, I think that the nature of the system being broken [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=343.52s)]
*  is increasingly evident with the grain population that we have, you know, and you would think [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=351.12s)]
*  that, you know, the industry continues to raise prices, right. It continues to raise prices at a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  pace that outpaces inflation, you know. Yeah. And that really underscores the industry being [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=368.56s)]
*  tone deaf. And right now, and I can get into it in a little bit, you know, I can get into, you know, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=378.16s)]
*  what's happening. But in many cases, what's driving price increases are actually the PBMs themselves, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=385.04s)]
*  who, you know, because, you know, what happens is you raise the price, but then you're also [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=392.88000000000005s)]
*  increasing the rebate. So, you know, the net amount that's coming back to the manufacturer [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=396.88s)]
*  is pretty negligible at the end of the day. So, you know, the definition of insanity is to do [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=403.28s)]
*  the same thing and expect a different outcome. So I don't think the industry can continue raising [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=410.64s)]
*  prices like they have been. And it's also continuing to, you know, fan the negative perception [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  that we have. You know, we're not helping ourselves by doing it either economically [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=422.96s)]
*  or from a public relations perspective. We lose, lose. You know, the industry's pricing [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=429.2s)]
*  headwinds are well known, particularly in the face of global cost and containment initiatives, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=435.67999999999995s)]
*  tethered at really tethering the unsustainable nature of our system. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  And the aging demographics is only making this harder. And there's a need to change, you know, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=446.56s)]
*  I mean, you can point to a lot of things in this country where we continue to kick the can. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=452.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, I don't think it's necessarily sustainable. I don't think this one is either. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=458.88s)]
*  So at some point it's going to be a day of reckoning. And I think there's still an [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=464.23999999999995s)]
*  opportunity for the industry to control the narrative as opposed to having the narrative [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  controlled for us. Yeah. You talked about a lot of things in this country that are, you know, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=473.2s)]
*  in the throes of being kicked down the road. And it's almost, you know, we have this conversation, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  I almost cynically or tongue in cheek want to ask you like, well, why not? Why not raise [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=486.08s)]
*  prices? I mean, you know, you said we outpaced the cost of inflation, which is that's really [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  saying something given the inflationary period that we're in right now. But the American public [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=497.2s)]
*  payers seem to be begrudgingly dealing with rising costs of grocery prices, rising cost of consumer [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=503.76s)]
*  packaged goods. I mean, automobiles are off the chain right now. Real estate is out of control. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=513.76s)]
*  Everything's getting more expensive. And I think to consumers anyway, to patients, as it were, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=520.72s)]
*  in this case, in all of those industries, there are gray areas where it's not understood exactly [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  who's benefiting or who's getting rich on these price increases. So not unlike the pharmaceutical [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=533.36s)]
*  last mile supply chain. All this expense that people and payers are burdened with [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=541.2s)]
*  is coming without apology. Yet, we keep paying. So why? And again, I ask the question sort of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=552.48s)]
*  tongue in cheek, why not drugs? Why shouldn't the people who are, you know, pulling the wool [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=562.0s)]
*  over our eyes in the pharmaceutical industry and making money on it, continue to get away with it [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=568.0s)]
*  the way that everyone else is right now? That sounded very cynical, didn't it? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=572.56s)]
*  You know, it's, you know, I think you're right on a lot of different levels. You know, I think [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=584.4s)]
*  what's where the industry has to go on some of these things, because, you know, if you buy a car, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=591.92s)]
*  right, it comes with a warranty. You know, if you go to the ATM machine and you don't get your money [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=599.04s)]
*  out, you know, you have recourse. You know, if you, you know, if you fly in an airline, you know, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  you have recourse. You know, we, you know, when you take our products, it either works or doesn't [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=617.2s)]
*  work. There's no recourse. So, you know, I think, you know, there should probably be more risk sharing [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=623.12s)]
*  as part of the answer to, you know, I think there's things that can be done in terms of squeezing out [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=631.2s)]
*  costs on the supply chain, as we can touch on and go into the PBMs. But I also think that there's [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=637.44s)]
*  things that we can also further do on a risk sharing perspective. You know, whether you can [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=643.12s)]
*  do it with current modalities, or you can certainly, I think it lends itself very much so with some of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=649.6s)]
*  the newer modalities, such as gene editing, when you're talking about sticker prices that are [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=654.8s)]
*  rather significant, you know, so there's going to be some risk, there's going to be a need for the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=661.04s)]
*  industry to risk share. You just, you know, you know, you just can't sell pills without there being [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=665.44s)]
*  any accountability or injections without it working, you know, and the industry is going to [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=670.4s)]
*  move to that at some point. But I think there's a lot of inefficiencies. And I think the way we [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=675.76s)]
*  have historically operated, as I touched on, is really there's lax transparency, there's a lot of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  different folks involved. And it's, you know, why did the chicken cross the road? Because they did [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  last year. And it's just like night follows day. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=695.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You've called out the the PBMs, not just because they contribute to excessive costs. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=698.88s)]
*  But I've heard you call them out, because in your opinion, they contribute to poor patient [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=707.6s)]
*  compliance and thus poor health outcomes. So explain what you mean by that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=712.96s)]
*  Yeah, for the benefit of all pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, work on behalf of the health [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=718.08s)]
*  plans and employers by creating formularies or lists of medicines covered by insurance. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=724.24s)]
*  It's important to highlight that PBMs were actually created with the objective of negotiating lower [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=731.2s)]
*  drug prices, while enabling patient access to medicines. How do you think that's been working? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=736.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, it hasn't worked out that way, as the PBMs have really lost their way. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=742.88s)]
*  At issue is the convoluted and opaque nature of their relationships, which greatly affect the [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=749.04s)]
*  cost of medicines for hundreds of millions of Americans. Presently, PBMs use their market [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=755.92s)]
*  power to profit by keeping drug prices high, harming patients in biotech and innovative [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=762.4s)]
*  innovation. Three PBMs, CVS, Express Grips, and OptumRx are integrated with pharmacy chains and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=768.4s)]
*  insurers and control 80% of the prescription drug market. This dynamic is driven by the rebate game, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=774.16s)]
*  which I'll further elaborate on. PBMs provide favorable placement on formularies, which are the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=782.16s)]
*  lists of medicines covered by health plans, and the number of patients who are in the PBMs. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=789.52s)]
*  Which are the lists of medicines covered by health insurances in exchange for rebates they [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=795.84s)]
*  receive from drug makers, effectively pay to play. Drug makers argue that they must raise [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=801.2s)]
*  prices to compensate for these rebates, while pharmacy benefit managers may change to drug [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=807.6s)]
*  companies raise prices to boost profits. In practice, this is not much different than a [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=813.2s)]
*  traditional retail shelf space for other consumer products, you know, slotting fees paid by retail [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=819.92s)]
*  product manufacturers, whereby commercial success can hinge on consumer patient access. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=825.92s)]
*  Without formulary listing, over 95% of the drug purchases will go elsewhere. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  Because of the situation, rebates are a really big factor in the increase of drug prices. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what's an alternative? I mean, you know, this is one of those things where [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=843.68s)]
*  the deeper you dig, the more convoluted you see things are. And I think in some cases, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=853.3599999999999s)]
*  when you're in a situation like that, it's more difficult to kind of claw your way out of it with [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=859.04s)]
*  a rational thought. So what is and or, you know, the alternative? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=862.88s)]
*  You know, it's the $250 billion question. You know, there's a lot of money at stake. And when [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=871.2s)]
*  you have that level of self-interest, you know, it's going to be very hard to take the candy away [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=876.8s)]
*  from those who have it right now. There's a lot of, you know, lobbying and self-interest groups. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=883.04s)]
*  But, you know, I think if we can focus on the patient and think about the patient, and this [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=889.6s)]
*  should be all about the patient and the outcomes of the patient, you know, I think it's easier to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=895.6s)]
*  get to answers that make sense and work towards that. You know, again, a lot of this is much [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=900.88s)]
*  easier said than done. But from my experience, drug adherence is the common denominator for all [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=908.56s)]
*  stakeholders and should serve as the foundation of patient engagement strategy. As patient drug [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=916.16s)]
*  compliance is the biggest rate limiting factor in successful outcomes, implementing patient loyalty [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=922.16s)]
*  programs that correlate pricing discounts to drug adherence would provide a win-win strategy [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=927.92s)]
*  for redirecting middlemen or PBM profits back to consumers while driving down drug prices. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=934.48s)]
*  Of course, as I said, this is much easier said than done. But I think it's a start to, you know, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=941.92s)]
*  the more a patient takes a drug and stays compliant, the drug price comes down. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=948.4s)]
*  So, you know, you're correlating everyone's interests to successful outcomes. Somehow, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=953.6s)]
*  you know, that gets lost in translation. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  So, if, you know, in a transition to that model, I'm just curious about the economics of it. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=965.68s)]
*  There's enough, I mean, in your, I guess, general perception, there's enough money [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=972.48s)]
*  padded or built in to allow that. Like, as you said, some of these new therapies come with an [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=978.32s)]
*  incredible sticker price. Adherence to that down the road, should some of the money that's going [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=984.8000000000001s)]
*  to PBMs in the form of rebates be reallocated? You think that the economy of that kind of downward [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=994.16s)]
*  scale works? You know, I think it certainly, in theory, drives alignment. You know, I would [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1000.8s)]
*  think if you can drive down drug pricing and you drive it down by compliance, you know, that should [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1008.4799999999999s)]
*  align. The only person that's misaligned or dislocated would be the PBMs. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1020.16s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the idea here is to provide patient access. And if you can reduce the costs [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1027.52s)]
*  and provide access, you know, I think that's a winning strategy for patients. You know, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1033.12s)]
*  as I mentioned, you know, the drug prices go high. But, you know, the gross to net discount is really [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1040.0s)]
*  the thing that sometimes gets lost in the headlines. And you know, what's the sticker [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1046.24s)]
*  price isn't necessarily certainly not realized by the manufacturer. It's really the difference [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1051.92s)]
*  between what the manufacturer gets and everybody in between. Yeah. Yeah. And to your point, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1056.5600000000002s)]
*  the compliance aspect on the health outcome aspect, you know, obviously compliance benefits [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1064.4s)]
*  the pharmaceutical company, right? I mean, that, you know, we're, if we're keeping them on the drug, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  we're selling more product. And if the health outcome as a result of that compliance is positive, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1076.4s)]
*  which in theory it would be if you've built a good drug, you're also not only selling more product, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1082.48s)]
*  but improving that perception of this industry that we've talked about on multiple occasions, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1088.96s)]
*  you know, in the absolute, you know, we're bottom of the barrel. People like the government and [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1094.5600000000002s)]
*  airlines and lawyers more than they like us. It's sad that the only thing that Washington [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1100.24s)]
*  agree on is to hate the biofarm industry. You know, there's no consensus anywhere [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1106.08s)]
*  anymore. And it's only in our industry that there's a consensus across the aisles. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1112.72s)]
*  Yeah. Well, speaking of the federal government, what is like the bigger question is who, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1118.08s)]
*  who is equipped to play a role in changing the paradigm? I'm assuming that would include, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1126.56s)]
*  you know, Congress and for the point you just made about their disdain for this industry, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1133.28s)]
*  they're at the very least that disdain indicates an appetite for change. So the bigger question is [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1140.8s)]
*  who's involved in a change like this? And, and like I said, I'm assuming that the, the federal [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1148.72s)]
*  government plays a role in there somewhere. You know, it would be, it'd be great if there was a [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1154.3999999999999s)]
*  single throat to choke here. You know, there's a lot of codependency, you know, and unfortunately, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1160.08s)]
*  you know, reform is, as we touched on, is much easier said than done when considering the number [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1167.4399999999998s)]
*  of factors and stakeholders that make up our complicated and varied healthcare landscape. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1173.12s)]
*  You know, just to show lack of alignment is just an illustration of one. For example, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  the PBMs put an emphasis on minimizing current period costs over healthcare system costs. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1184.72s)]
*  So rather than treating somebody with a chronic issue or paying for something that would be useful, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1191.2800000000002s)]
*  it's in their benefit to pay the more of the generic cost lower, less innovative product [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1196.88s)]
*  in order just to minimize their costs today, even if it's not realized hospitalization down the road. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1202.64s)]
*  And that's really a huge systemic misalignment that focuses on short-term cost and profit as [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1209.6000000000001s)]
*  opposed to patient outcomes. So, you know, you know, where we kind of, we can't get out of our own way [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1216.8s)]
*  and, you know, you really need to, I think, reorientate what the outcomes are and what [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1224.32s)]
*  we're trying to. And I think, you know, as an industry, it's an opportunity for us to kind of [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1230.56s)]
*  change that paradigm a little bit or try to, at least try to control the narrative. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1236.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, I don't think we really have staked out a position other than [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1244.64s)]
*  focusing on the PBMs are better than focusing on us. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  At some pharma companies, you know, we're seeing like, I think, Lily is toying with [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1258.96s)]
*  like a direct to consumer model. We see the likes of like Mark Cuban playing with this. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1265.6s)]
*  We see Amazon getting in the pharmaceutical distribution business. To what degree do those [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1271.36s)]
*  moves that we see happening across some of those companies play into this concept? I mean, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1278.56s)]
*  in my simple mind, I see that as, I see those as favorable indications toward change because [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1284.6399999999999s)]
*  at the very least, there's a more direct line to patients. Do you agree or do you see anything [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1292.8s)]
*  problematic there or? No, I totally agree. I think it's absolutely a really, really important [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1299.1999999999998s)]
*  step here. You know, it's a step towards changing the paradigm. You know, historically, you've always [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1308.08s)]
*  used the big drug distributors and that's how business was done. You know, going back to what [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1314.16s)]
*  I said, you know, it was just the way we, why the chicken crossed the road. You know, this changes [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1324.4s)]
*  that, you know, and I think you're seeing that Lily's been doing that in terms of some of the [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1330.8000000000002s)]
*  GLP drugs that they've got direct to consumer. And, you know, I think some of that also lends [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1338.32s)]
*  itself because some of those things are outside of insurance. I think, you know, what Amazon and [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1344.56s)]
*  Cuban are doing are more directed to generics, but I think it does provide the platform that's [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1351.52s)]
*  going to be necessary to give people alternative ways of distributing drugs. You know, I think the, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1357.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, the control over the formulary is important because that controls reimbursement. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1364.48s)]
*  You know, you got to follow the cash, you know, at the end of the day, follow that, which is why I [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1369.6s)]
*  think, you know, if you can make the rebates part of a compliance program, I think you can drive some [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1375.52s)]
*  really good outcomes. But, you know, and cutting out the middleman by what those folks are doing [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1382.24s)]
*  is going to squeeze out wasteful costs. You know, the question is how you can kind of scale that out [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1390.8s)]
*  and make it much more pervasive to really upset and put pressure on the system. Because right now, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1396.1599999999999s)]
*  I think I'd probably call it more of an ad and a nuance as opposed to something that's going to [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1402.32s)]
*  really change the way we conduct business. I think, but I think we also need to be mindful [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1408.0s)]
*  that the way care delivery is going on is changing. You know, I don't think it's as much of us [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1416.4s)]
*  selling a pill anymore or selling an injection. You know, we're selling an outcome. You know, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1424.96s)]
*  when you look at gene editing or gene therapy or any of those, you know, those are almost like [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1430.5600000000002s)]
*  providing a service. You know, it's not as much of the traditional way we conduct. You know, you look [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1435.8400000000001s)]
*  at digital pharma. You know, it's all about engaging the consumer and educating the consumer [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1444.0s)]
*  and the consumer is playing a much more active role. Let's just look at all the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1450.32s)]
*  commercials we watch on TV when we're watching a ball game, you know, in terms of all the [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1454.48s)]
*  consumers. So, you know, I think we got to extend that and become engaged with them. And I think, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1460.64s)]
*  you know, recognizing healthcare consumerism is here to stay is really important and the internet [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1467.52s)]
*  and e-health have facilitated this. Bio Pharma must focus on creating closer relationships [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1474.96s)]
*  with patients as well as the other stakeholders. The step change towards healthcare consumerism [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1480.56s)]
*  necessitates supporting patients on their journey and becoming more engaged and educated in their [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1486.16s)]
*  decision making. You know, I think a lot of times patients are overwhelmed with some of the [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1491.2s)]
*  indications and diseases that they have. They don't necessarily know where to turn. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1499.44s)]
*  And I think, you know, other than just selling them a drug, you know, I think you can help them [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1503.76s)]
*  with their patient experience. And I think, you know, it's going to create a lot more loyalty [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1509.3600000000001s)]
*  with the consumer. Yeah. Yeah. I want to drill into that a little bit, a little bit more on, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1517.12s)]
*  you know, the Bio Pharma corporate and leadership role and to what degree they can play a hand in [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1524.4799999999998s)]
*  affecting change here. But real quick, before I go there, one of the things that I've heard you [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1531.04s)]
*  often wax on is the influence of politics on industry during an election year. So I'm curious [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1536.0s)]
*  about whether or not the fact that like, like I asked you earlier, why is this a timely conversation [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1545.6s)]
*  to have right now? We are in an election year. We do see quite a bit of jockeying for position [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1551.1999999999998s)]
*  and influence in Congress right now around the biopharmaceutical industry, whether it's around [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1557.84s)]
*  pricing and benefits or whether it's around who we do business with of Chinese origin, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1562.9599999999998s)]
*  a la the Bio Secure Act, which I don't want to get into right now. We'll save that for another [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1569.28s)]
*  episode. But my point is that we see a lot of this kind of positioning happening right now, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1574.0s)]
*  and I think that's probably influenced by the fact that it's an election year. What impact do you think [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1579.1999999999998s)]
*  this year of politics could, in a positive sense, have on at least starting the ball [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1586.24s)]
*  rolling a little bit toward change? Well, I'd say what is positive is that, you know, that we had [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1596.0s)]
*  that first bill that got approved in the House to lower costs and in Transparency Act. That was [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1602.8s)]
*  really the first bill that I'm aware of that's been approved by the House to kind of hold PBMs [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1610.1599999999999s)]
*  much more accountable and ensure health decisions are made by patients and doctors and not driven [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  by middlemen at the end of the day. You know, that certainly is a formal recognition of the issue. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1622.72s)]
*  The White House has initiated discussions at the end of February on the topic as well. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1630.96s)]
*  So it certainly seems to be front and center. So I would hope, given that it's an election year, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1638.4s)]
*  you know, we can, you know, use our vote, our influence, and reach out to our senators and [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1645.28s)]
*  our congressmen to facilitate that. For everybody's benefit, the Bio website actually has [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1652.64s)]
*  a place on their website where you put in your zip code, you know, they got the form letter and [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1664.72s)]
*  they've got, they can really direct it to whoever you need to direct it to. So it shouldn't be an [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1669.92s)]
*  investment of too much time, but the impact can be really profound. So I would certainly encourage [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1674.96s)]
*  people to do that. And, you know, to your point, you know, in the election year, people, you know, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1680.4s)]
*  particularly since they have a target that they both agree on, maybe that's our best protection [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1686.64s)]
*  is that they're not going to be able to differentiate ourselves by beating on us. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1691.0400000000002s)]
*  I'm hoping that the PBMs will bear a bit of that as well as an actual, as their profile gets raised [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1697.2800000000002s)]
*  as a more objective villainous manner. But, you know, I think it's only going to be natural, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, that, you know, it's going to put some pressure on the industry, you know, there's going [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  to be talk about expanding IRA, you know, I think there's also positive things in there that I'm [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1720.16s)]
*  hearing that they may fix the disconnect between large and small molecules and may make it a little [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1726.72s)]
*  bit easier for off and drugs. So I think there's been some general acknowledgement that some of [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1732.32s)]
*  that policy was has room for improvement, you know, I think so I think as part of some of the [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1737.52s)]
*  horse trading, you know, I think that made that there's some positive in that in that sense. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1743.6799999999998s)]
*  But I do think, you know, we're going to be a punching bag because that's what politicians do. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1752.08s)]
*  You know, I think, you know, I think a lot in my view, it's going to be more noise and bulk than [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1756.24s)]
*  bite. And that's obviously to be determined. Yeah, yeah. I want to get back to the the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1762.5600000000002s)]
*  biopharma, the bio biopharma and biotech industry role. I mean, it's an interesting time also [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1771.28s)]
*  looking at looking at biotech crop of young up and comers. You know, the industry is bouncing back. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1777.1200000000001s)]
*  It might not be a rapid bounce, but it's a it's a bounce nonetheless. And a lot of these a lot of [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1787.0400000000002s)]
*  the biotech execs that I spend time talking with are, you know, a generation or two removed from [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1792.48s)]
*  you and I, Alan, they grew up in a in sort of, you know, push the boundaries and explore new [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1797.76s)]
*  avenues kind of world. And and that's good. Like, I think it's good as we look forward to making [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  change happen at the at the drug distribution level. But the question would be like, what can they [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1811.52s)]
*  what role what role can can the industry industry leaders play? I had an interesting [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1819.6s)]
*  conversation just recently with a guy totally unrelated topic, but I was talking with a guy, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1825.1999999999998s)]
*  Paul Preeb, who's working with me on a on a project for a single use bioprocess manufacturing [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1829.84s)]
*  single use event. Right. So totally unrelated to what we're talking about right now. But we [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1836.0s)]
*  started talking about standards and he said something that really resonated. He said in his [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1839.84s)]
*  capacity, he hears from a lot of biopharma execs and leaders and SMEs who constantly refer to [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1843.9199999999998s)]
*  standards bodies as they and what they need to do. And they need the you know, they need to do this [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1850.9599999999998s)]
*  and they need to do that. They need to affect this and that. And Paul's response was they is us. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1856.8799999999999s)]
*  Like they is us. Like we if you want standards or systems or operations to change, you can't just [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1863.12s)]
*  sit there and say they you got to get involved. So to what degree can industry leadership, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1870.8799999999999s)]
*  individuals, people who have opinions and and want to see benefit to patients, they want to see [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1877.52s)]
*  benefit to their drug distribution models, even even before they exist. What can they do? What [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1883.9199999999998s)]
*  can they be doing right now? You know, I think we need to kind of row in the same direction. But [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1892.88s)]
*  I think in terms of that, you know, I like the wood the woodpecker has always been very effective. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1899.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, you just got to keep pecking in that regard. But I think, you know, changing the way [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1904.4s)]
*  we distribute drugs is something that we should all think about. You know, we don't have to cross [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1911.3600000000001s)]
*  the road like the chicken. You know, there are other ways. I think what you know, what Amazon and [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1918.16s)]
*  Cuban are doing, you know, speak, speak to that. Directed consumer approaches are going to become [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1923.68s)]
*  a possibility. So, you know, you know, I think it's something to think about. You know, I think, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1932.88s)]
*  you know, you don't want to necessarily be the do mercenary selling, you know, mercenaries get a lot [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1939.2s)]
*  of arrows in their back. I think it's something for all of us to continue to think about. I would [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1944.0s)]
*  say that fundamentally, though, that, you know, it's really important for us to focus on, you know, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1950.72s)]
*  perhaps statements of the obvious, but first things first, you know, you need to focus on [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1957.44s)]
*  developing differentiated and impactful products. And it's critical to really understand what your [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1961.84s)]
*  target product profile is. Otherwise, it's akin to getting into a car without a destination. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1967.6s)]
*  You're never going to get there. And in addition to establishing clinical value, which I think [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1974.08s)]
*  people always focus on, you know, you need to really understand, you know, how is that going to [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1980.08s)]
*  be differentiated at the end of the day from the standard of care and the competitive products that [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1984.88s)]
*  are out there. And one area that I think people really, really overlook gloss over, I think it's [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1989.84s)]
*  getting, I think it's becoming more, but I think again, I think it's worth taking a survey and [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=1998.64s)]
*  seeing where it falls. And that is focusing on the pharmacoeconomics of a product and really [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2004.5600000000002s)]
*  able to demonstrate the economic value. And ideally, that should really be built into, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2011.68s)]
*  you know, your clinical studies as appropriate. You know, you should be able to remeasure, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2018.16s)]
*  I think I touched on it, you know, rehospitalization, you know, additional procedures, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2023.36s)]
*  you know, and factor in what are you saving the system? Again, I think the emphasis should be on [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2029.9199999999998s)]
*  outcomes and system savings. You know, we as a nation, you know, have the highest cost per [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2037.04s)]
*  capita on healthcare spend, and we have the lowest life expectancy in the Western world. You know, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2045.84s)]
*  we'll figure, you know, we're actually spending more for less. That's not good. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2052.48s)]
*  For sure. For sure, it's not. In the meantime, like in the reality that we're in right now, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2058.96s)]
*  and that's all great advice. I mean, having a thorough understanding of your, the economic [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2067.52s)]
*  impact of your therapy gives you, I think, empowerment to have a say at least in the way [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2071.92s)]
*  that these things are distributed and who gets paid for them. If you're going to give some advice [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2080.0s)]
*  to someone who's on the precipice, you know, who's about to launch a new therapy in the current [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2085.44s)]
*  paradigm, is there anything that you can suggest to them as to how they navigate in the reality [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2092.08s)]
*  that we're in right now? Right? Like, it's one thing to affect big change, and these are great [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2100.08s)]
*  ideas. I mean, it's great to talk about them. But in the paradigm that we're in right now, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2104.56s)]
*  is there anything that they can do to affect, you know, a better outcome despite the money grab? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2108.88s)]
*  You know, I think you just got to, I think it's really blocking and tackling, you know. I don't [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2118.88s)]
*  think you can really, really swim against the tide here. I think you just understand what you're up [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2123.28s)]
*  against. And I think it's really, again, coming back to being able to position your drug, understand [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2131.36s)]
*  who are the right patients for your drug, make sure that, you know, that they understand the drug, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2138.48s)]
*  that they comply and continue taking the drug, making sure, again, whether or not there's [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2147.84s)]
*  pre-authorization, you know. There's a lot of hoops to get involved with this. So, you know, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2153.36s)]
*  I think an interesting statistic is how many scripts actually get converted and get fulfilled. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2159.28s)]
*  And there's a big gap there. So, you know, that's money that's falling on the ground, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2166.0s)]
*  and patients that are not being helped. So, I think there's things that you want to look at in [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2173.2799999999997s)]
*  terms of ensuring your commercial execution. You know, there's a reason why many drug launches [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2178.72s)]
*  for companies get shorted by the investors on Wall Street. And that's because they don't [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2186.72s)]
*  necessarily execute so well. So, the expectations around the drug launch are generally [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2192.72s)]
*  disconnected from what the ultimate reality is. And that inefficiency provides an arbitrage [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2200.56s)]
*  opportunity for investors. So, you know, learning, I would certainly go to school and look at recent [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2207.04s)]
*  drug launches and look at the ones that have worked and look at the ones that haven't worked, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2213.52s)]
*  understand why in both cases, and incorporate those lessons and learnings [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2219.12s)]
*  into your plan of action. Yeah, very good. What have I not asked you or not allowed you the time [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2227.92s)]
*  to elaborate on in terms of this topic and the ideas around affecting change? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2235.92s)]
*  You know, I think I would just kind of reinforce what we've said, because I think we've covered [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2242.64s)]
*  this pretty well at a high level. And I would just say that, you know, the combination of [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2249.2799999999997s)]
*  exposing and reforming PBMs and championing biopharma consumerism would really be a great start [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2256.4s)]
*  rehabilitating the biopharma bad boy image that we have right now. And I think there's a huge, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2266.4s)]
*  huge opportunity. You know, the bar is very low. The bar is very low. The bar is very low. Yes. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2273.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, good stuff, Alan. I appreciate the conversation. And I mean, do you know, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2282.2400000000002s)]
*  when you tackle a topic like this on the podcast, where you're talking about the [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2287.36s)]
*  podcast, where, you know, the concept is big, and the momentum that it would take to create [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2293.68s)]
*  changes like difficult to fathom? Are you comfortable? Are you comfortable? Are you like, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2302.48s)]
*  you know, somebody's got to talk about this stuff? No, absolutely. You know, I mean, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2309.6s)]
*  I'd be happy to talk about the US budget deficit. That doesn't seem to be getting a lot of ad time, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxiJj-jazOw&t=2316.64s)]
