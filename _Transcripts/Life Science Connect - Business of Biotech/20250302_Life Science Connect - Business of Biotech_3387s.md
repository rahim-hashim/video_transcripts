Video Description: On this episode of the Business of Biotech, recorded on-site at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, we explore a new approach to biotech financing with XOMA Royalty's Owen Hughes and Brad Sitko. The CEO and CIO, respectively, share an innovative royalty aggregation model that mitigates risk while enabling immediate capital access to biotech firms. We learn the differences between royalty financing and equity-based funding, how the model addresses traditional risk in biotech financing, the evolution of XOMA's business model, and much more. 

The 2025 BoB@JPM series is supported by Alston & Bird, whose national health care and life sciences practice has more than 100 attorneys actively involved and integrated across the full spectrum of legal disciplines including regulatory, compliance, public policy, transactional, corporate governance, securities, FDA, biotechnology, intellectual property, government investigations, and litigation practice areas.

# BoB@JPM: Owen Hughes & Brad Sitko, XOMA Royalty
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY)
*  Owen Hughes and Brad Sipko are CEO and CIO respectively of a new company playing by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=0.0s)]
*  a new set of biotech investment rules. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=12.3s)]
*  It's called Zonelink Royalty. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=16.02s)]
*  And these two are collectively mastering the art of mitigating biotech investment risk [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  while simultaneously expediting the path of a host of therapeutics to patients. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=23.86s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=29.8s)]
*  This is the Business of Biotech JP Morgan edition. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=30.8s)]
*  We're here in the beautiful offices of the law firm of Alston & Byrd who we're partnering [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=34.08s)]
*  up with on this series. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=39.6s)]
*  We're very thankful for the space. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=41.68s)]
*  If you have any biotech or life sciences legal needs, Alston & Byrd is your firm. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=43.2s)]
*  I want to start out by getting to know you guys a little bit, but before we get into [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  of you guys and what collective expertise you bring to do this new sort of investment paradigm. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=55.36s)]
*  I want to learn about that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=64.72s)]
*  So I want to start there. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=65.72s)]
*  Originally, I was thinking, let's just start by getting to know these guys, but let's start [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=66.72s)]
*  with sharing the fundamental layout of what royalty aggregation is, and then we'll get [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=69.96s)]
*  into your backgrounds and how you're uniquely suited to move into this business. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=76.64s)]
*  Nice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=81.52s)]
*  Sure thing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=82.52s)]
*  Thank you for the invitation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=83.52s)]
*  We're so happy to be here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=84.52s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=85.52s)]
*  Thank you for taking time out of a very busy week to join me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=86.52s)]
*  Our pleasure. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=88.96s)]
*  Our pleasure. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=89.96s)]
*  Second is, if that introduction has not been trademarked. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=90.96s)]
*  We actually can take that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  You can have it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  That was the most eloquent approach in description of Zellman and what we're trying to do. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  I wrote it out so that I would deliver it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, Brad is much more steeped in royalty finance than I am, so Brad, why don't you [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=102.92s)]
*  give him a sense of what we're doing? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=111.08s)]
*  What we're doing is actually bringing forward for a payment to pay future at-risk cash flows [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=112.32s)]
*  from pharmaceutical products. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=120.52s)]
*  That could be where a partnership is in place. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=122.8s)]
*  Say a biotech company is developing a drug and they partner with a big farm. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=125.64s)]
*  There's a contractual arrangement that usually has milestones, like when you achieve your [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=129.56s)]
*  next phase of clinical development and when you achieve your regulatory approval or filing, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=134.2s)]
*  and then you have royalties. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=140.52s)]
*  A portion of future net sales of the drugs. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=142.08s)]
*  That's all at-risk and takes time. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  What we do is pull that forward to a bolus of capital today. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  What that allows companies to do is be flexible and deploy that type of capital to a new project [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=152.56s)]
*  that they're working on. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=158.32s)]
*  Maybe they have a proprietary program that they want to advance or a platform that they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=159.4s)]
*  want to take forward to the next stage and advance a programming to IND. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  What we're doing is going to create a novel form of financing that's not equity related. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=168.44s)]
*  So instead of selling pieces of a specific company or shares of your overall company, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  you're limiting the economic dilution to just a single partner program. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=180.44s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=186.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=187.24s)]
*  So it's interesting, but it sounds a little bit complicated. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=188.24s)]
*  I'm curious about how well-known this model is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=192.56s)]
*  Are you guys coming out of left field sometimes when you propose? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=197.6s)]
*  Rural financing is somewhat similar to specs in the sense that it was a four-letter word [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=202.48s)]
*  that has very adverse connotation until really the last couple of years. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  So I would say is that when you're in a set of a board meeting and you're looking at all [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  the financing options that are available to you as a company, rural financing is probably [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=218.88s)]
*  at the bottom, historically speaking. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=223.68s)]
*  I think. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=225.28s)]
*  Given what's happening in the public parks today in a lot of civic years, it's ascending [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=226.28s)]
*  the order. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=230.72s)]
*  It is probably right up there with equity, with debt actually being below that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=231.72s)]
*  And so it's in vogue in the sense because of what Brad just said, which is you can isolate [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=236.64s)]
*  the dilution to a single product relative to an entire company. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  So if you believe that the company is worth the summation of its cash flows, the cash [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=244.24s)]
*  flow is divided by the solid diluted shares outstanding. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=249.44s)]
*  You're selling equity and you're giving people all parts of every single product that you're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=251.72s)]
*  delivering. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=257.16s)]
*  In a world of modernization, you're isolating it to one particular program and you maintain [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=258.16s)]
*  your equity ownership across the entire spectrum of your pipeline in a world of modernization, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=264.04s)]
*  which is quite different. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=270.08s)]
*  If you think about biotech, it's somewhat similar to actually building a house in that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=272.24s)]
*  it always takes more time and always takes more money. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=275.32s)]
*  That translates to is more dilution for equity shareholders. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=277.96s)]
*  And what we're trying to provide management teams and their shareholders and ability to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=280.96s)]
*  actually progress molecules without suffering the equity dilution that is consistent or [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  inherently drug developed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  So you have a unique background in that you've worked in finance, but also you've worked [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=290.96s)]
*  on the biotech side. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=298.56s)]
*  So you've seen some of that firsthand. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=299.56s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about that and sort of give us your background in the context of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=301.0s)]
*  how it set you up to start Zoma. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=306.04s)]
*  It really didn't start Zoma. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=308.52s)]
*  Zoma was better run out in 1981. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=310.52s)]
*  It started as... [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=314.12s)]
*  Oh, so you know, I mean in 1981 you were like a toddler. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=315.12s)]
*  I was just a baby. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=317.84s)]
*  That is true. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=319.84s)]
*  But made a little history in the company because I think that's important in relative to where [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=320.84s)]
*  we are and then where Brad and I come in. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=324.56s)]
*  So Zoma started in 1981. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=326.68s)]
*  It actually went public in 1984. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=328.88s)]
*  It's actually the longest tenured publicly traded quote unquote biotech company. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=331.44s)]
*  So people know Zoma as an antibody discovery company. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  And over those ensuing probably 30 to 40 years, Zoma has touched hundreds of antibodies. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  Over the course of that time, the management team decided that they want to take some additional [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=347.28s)]
*  risks and try to get into clinical development so they could actually generate better returns [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=353.2s)]
*  for the children over time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=357.72s)]
*  Unfortunately the company was not very successful in that endeavor. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  But what they were very successful in is actually creating the CDRs, the sequences that actually [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  make an antibody. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  That was their bread and butter. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  So there are a number of different assets, antibodies that were actually discovered by [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  Zoma. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=374.36s)]
*  One of the most prolific ones is a drug called Gertux. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=375.36s)]
*  It actually came from our BCN phase display technologies. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  So in 2017 after several sentbacks, the company tried to win on the verge of bankruptcy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=385.56s)]
*  And the existing management team, namely our CFO Tom Burns and the existing CEO at that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=391.48s)]
*  point in time, they contacted a number of different funds to see if they could actually work a [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=395.92s)]
*  different business model. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=401.72s)]
*  And there's a fund here in San Francisco by the name of the Biotechnology Valuing Fund. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=403.32s)]
*  It was instrumental in the development of a company called Ligand, a competitor to ours [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=407.28s)]
*  that's slightly bigger than we are. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=412.2s)]
*  And they actually recapped the company in 2017 with some capital and set us on the process [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=415.0s)]
*  of being there. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=419.76s)]
*  So we understand the trials and tribulations of drug development because we've lived it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=422.52000000000004s)]
*  Not only personally, but the company as a whole, the quality of the company has lived [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  in there a bit. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=430.36s)]
*  So they were on the verge of bankruptcy several times and they sold different royalties at [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=431.36s)]
*  that point time to various parties so they could continue on their clinical development [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=435.2s)]
*  path. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=439.0s)]
*  And it wasn't until 2017 when Tom, our CFO, came to light, he was like, we should probably [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=440.16s)]
*  stop doing this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=445.48s)]
*  History would suggest that we're not very good at it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=446.48s)]
*  But what we are very good at is actually making these antibodies. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=449.16s)]
*  So we started with the base of around 40 to 50 assets that came from our licenses. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=451.96s)]
*  We went out and prostituted the IP around those licenses and brought everything back, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=456.8s)]
*  the royalties and milestones. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=460.32s)]
*  That's actually what started. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=462.32s)]
*  So that's really important because to try to replicate our business model would probably [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=463.32s)]
*  take a decade or so. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=467.72s)]
*  And today, very few people actually have the patience in this particular space. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  And then overall, as an investment perspective, to wait 10 years for this type of investment [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=474.64s)]
*  to come to fruition. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  So that's the history of the company. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's why I think it's really important to understand what we're doing because we [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  live it, we breathe it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=485.88s)]
*  People often ask Brad and I, what's the difference between investing and operating? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=488.44s)]
*  We've done both. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=492.0s)]
*  And what we say is that actually they're very similar. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=493.56s)]
*  You walk home with your head between your tail asking yourself, why am I doing this? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=496.76s)]
*  Because they're both extremely, extremely difficult. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=501.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=504.12s)]
*  With that said, our backgrounds are akin to both investing and operating, which is essentially [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=505.12s)]
*  what this business is. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=511.16s)]
*  Frankly, maybe not really good at either. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=512.48s)]
*  You kind of sit right in the middle. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=516.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=517.36s)]
*  So maybe you can give them a little of your background. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=518.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=519.36s)]
*  I'll talk to them on that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=520.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=521.36s)]
*  I've been kind of 20 years, risen in life sciences in different forms and factions. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=522.36s)]
*  And I've touched royalties over that entire career from different angles. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=528.36s)]
*  So started out early as a strategy consultant, working with royalty findings is one of the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=533.16s)]
*  things that's mandated on to find, assess, and value different types of future royalties [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=539.2s)]
*  that they could apply. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=545.36s)]
*  Like it's the space that's developing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=546.36s)]
*  Like what Owen said earlier about financing of last resort to now financing a priority. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=548.64s)]
*  That's where that evolution started. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=554.08s)]
*  Then I was on Wall Street at an investment bank, MTS Health Partners, where I was doing [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=555.6s)]
*  mergers and acquisitions, equity capital raises, and most importantly royalty monetization [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=561.56s)]
*  from the agent inside. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=567.4s)]
*  So helping companies or universities raise capital by bringing some of the payments, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=569.4s)]
*  the future payments for those royalties forward. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=574.76s)]
*  And it was really interesting in that because you then see how the entire royalty universe [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=576.64s)]
*  worked, how people behaved, how they thought about things, how they structured, how their [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=581.08s)]
*  strengths and their weaknesses. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=587.12s)]
*  It was kind of like seeing the chessboard and analyzing how each of the chess pieces [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=588.64s)]
*  could move across the board. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=592.52s)]
*  And each has their unique place in the universe and you've got to deploy them, reduce them [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=594.48s)]
*  at the right time. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=599.04s)]
*  I went on to become an operator at a company called DNA Nexus, which was a sport illustrating [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=600.04s)]
*  a tournament in a health IT company, and then ended up as an investor at RTW Investments, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=605.36s)]
*  a large biotech full life cycle investment fund, whereas leading the structured finance [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=611.04s)]
*  and alternatives practice. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=616.88s)]
*  And I was doing non-deleted capital solutions for companies. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=618.32s)]
*  So each step along the way, you have to look at the royalty space in different ways and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=622.28s)]
*  see what is something that we could provide with this asset class that's truly differentiated. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=627.32s)]
*  Is there a better place for it in the market than where it was existing? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=634.4s)]
*  It exists primarily for commercial products, products that had been launched already had [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=638.24s)]
*  sales. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=643.6s)]
*  It was very much credit like. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=644.6s)]
*  Whereas what we're doing is a little bit different take where we're looking at that same asset [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=646.68s)]
*  class and looking at it earlier because we in this public company can benefit from being [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=650.72s)]
*  patient and having time. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=658.24s)]
*  And in the meantime, we're creating a lot of value for the biotech ecosystem because [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=660.28s)]
*  we're providing a type of capital that's otherwise unavailable in their life cycle. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=664.84s)]
*  So like this really interesting synergistic way. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=670.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=672.96s)]
*  I can see where this would be appealing to your point, you know, sort of moving up the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=673.96s)]
*  ranks. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=677.52s)]
*  I've fielded in the past years, as you can imagine, a lot of requests and inquiries around [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=678.52s)]
*  creative sources of capital because that direct route has been a little bit dry as [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=685.64s)]
*  we know. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=692.6s)]
*  It occurs to me, this is just theoretically, it occurs to me that the risk aspect still [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=693.6s)]
*  has to remain somewhere, right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=703.0s)]
*  Like the risk shifts. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=704.76s)]
*  So where does the risk shift in this model? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=706.26s)]
*  Maybe shift in height. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  If you actually think about our business model, and we do have several competitors, but our [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=710.2s)]
*  competitors generally speaking are actually further up to the right, meaning they're actually [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=714.52s)]
*  a later stage. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=717.88s)]
*  So we're the only company that we're aware of that actually spans the entire drug development [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=719.52s)]
*  spectrum. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=724.16s)]
*  We will underwrite risk at a pre-credible stage all the way up to a commercial stage. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=725.16s)]
*  And so the way we think about risk is not much different than actually what we learned [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=729.64s)]
*  in our CFA dates, right? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=732.64s)]
*  Support management. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=734.4399999999999s)]
*  What we're trying to find is the efficient frontiers. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=735.4399999999999s)]
*  How much risk do we need to take in order to engender a return that's commended with [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=738.1999999999999s)]
*  that risk? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=741.0s)]
*  And so we take the principles of finance and we apply it to drug development. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=742.72s)]
*  And if you take equity-like risk for credit-like returns, I would suggest that's a pretty bad [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=746.8s)]
*  business model. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=752.0s)]
*  And I wouldn't suggest that our competitors are doing that per se, but I would say is [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=754.12s)]
*  that as you go further and further right to more and more assets that are further de-risked, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=757.2s)]
*  your returns will come down over time. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=762.72s)]
*  So for us, just given where our balance sheet is relative to what our business model is, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=765.6s)]
*  is that we're trying to focus on the earlier stage assets. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=769.6s)]
*  You will be wrong more often than you're right. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=773.36s)]
*  But there's a difference between your batting average and your slugging percentage. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=775.5600000000001s)]
*  You can bat 200, but have a slugging percentage of 600 and still make significant money. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=779.96s)]
*  And we look at any portfolio attribution analysis. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=785.2800000000001s)]
*  Generally speaking, what you find is two or three things that power the returns in the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=788.08s)]
*  overall portfolio. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=791.0s)]
*  Whether it's a hedge fund, a private equity fund, a mutual fund, and a public perspective, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=792.0s)]
*  there's three or four things, three or four investments that drive the overall returns. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=798.8s)]
*  There's several investments that come in the middle that are plus one is 25%. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=802.64s)]
*  And the key is to try to limit the zeros. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  And if you can do that, you can generate pretty good IRRs over time. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=808.3599999999999s)]
*  So where our focus is on essentially the asymmetric risk reward, where we don't have enough information [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=811.56s)]
*  to truly underwrite to a 50% probability of success. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  In our world, it's either zero or 100%. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=820.8s)]
*  The drug either won't work, it's not going to work. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  So the way we think about risk is how much money are we willing to lose? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=825.48s)]
*  And so many of our investments are staged in the sense that this whole quantum of capital, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=829.4s)]
*  it's relatively finite in the sense that we know exactly what it is. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=834.52s)]
*  We don't put ourselves at risk for future payments down the road, generally speaking. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=838.64s)]
*  And if we lose that investment, meaning we lose that money, it's not detrimental to the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=842.96s)]
*  overall company because it's shielded by our overall portfolio. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=846.16s)]
*  So our objective since we came here is trying to build a portfolio while it's in sheer [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=849.76s)]
*  size, but diversified across the actual risk spectrum, preclinical to commercial, diversified [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=854.48s)]
*  by the therapeutic indication, ecology, neurology, immunology, et cetera, divided by the stage, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  and then by the modality, small molecules, antibodies. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=872.6400000000001s)]
*  We haven't entered into the gene therapy space just quite yet. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=876.48s)]
*  Looking at a few things there. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=879.6400000000001s)]
*  And that gets you total diversification because what we learned in the 2008-2009 time frame, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=881.24s)]
*  while we're sitting on Wall Street, historically speaking, people have said that stocks and bonds [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=887.24s)]
*  and gold and real estate, crypto maybe, is not really correlated. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=893.08s)]
*  But in 2008-2009, we learned that except that opposite, that all those asset classes are [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=897.64s)]
*  totally, totally correlated. Correlation of one, everything went down. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=903.3199999999999s)]
*  And so the interesting thing about our business model is that an oncology asset and a virology [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=907.64s)]
*  asset, an antibiotic, whatever it may be, are totally uncorrelated. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=911.88s)]
*  Not only are they uncorrelated from a science perspective, they're uncorrelated from an [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=915.8s)]
*  economic perspective. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=918.92s)]
*  Recessions, generally speaking, will not hit from a school product. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=919.7199999999999s)]
*  It may dip slightly. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=923.4799999999999s)]
*  So what we're developing is an asset class that's totally uncorrelated to the equity [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=925.2399999999999s)]
*  and credit markets, which should be very appealing to an ultimate investor. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=929.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=933.48s)]
*  And so with all that said, where we are in the gestation of our company is that we're [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=934.76s)]
*  just kind of getting out of the crib and just starting to crawl. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=939.48s)]
*  And what? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=943.48s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  It does. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=946.28s)]
*  It does. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=947.16s)]
*  But you're crawling around a lot of moving parts. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=947.64s)]
*  I'm curious about the management approach, right? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=950.84s)]
*  Like it's highly situational, a lot of moving parts, a lot of assets at different stages, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=954.44s)]
*  across multiple modalities. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=959.96s)]
*  I mean, is there a mechanism by which an algorithm may be, some AI or machine learning? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=961.72s)]
*  Like what's the sexy sauce that allows you to, you know, on a daily basis, make decisions [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=967.1600000000001s)]
*  around these assets and at least be aware, right, of the progress and where it's going? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=974.0400000000001s)]
*  And to make it probably better than any algorithm. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=978.52s)]
*  It's a black box. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=981.88s)]
*  It's the experience of a school of our nuts. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=982.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=985.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=986.44s)]
*  If you've been around the block long enough and seen enough things, you have an education. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=987.0s)]
*  So what could be good and what may not be good. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=991.72s)]
*  And so there's no compression algorithm for experience. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=995.64s)]
*  So I think that the way we generally look at it is you've got to create that diversity. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=999.8000000000001s)]
*  There are ebbs and flows in the sector. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1005.08s)]
*  There are modalities that are really interesting today that a couple years ago, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1007.4s)]
*  no one would touch them. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1013.0s)]
*  There's pendulum swings all over the place. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1014.12s)]
*  So I think the way we think about it is you keep that diversity and that [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1016.12s)]
*  lack of correlation as much as possible, you know, with the focus on that long term end goal, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1020.36s)]
*  which for us is creating long term sustainable cash flows at a significant rate and a ramping rate. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1026.36s)]
*  How you get there is, you know, situation dependent. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1033.4s)]
*  We talked to, I mean, we've been overwhelmed with JP Morgan this year talking to companies [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1036.76s)]
*  who are trying to navigate the environment. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1041.08s)]
*  So it's like, how do you, one, find something that we think is interesting, has potential, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1042.68s)]
*  like has the potential to go forward, a situation where we can be helpful and meaningful. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1048.44s)]
*  Like we write checks that are only applicable to certain sizes of companies or situations. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1053.96s)]
*  So it's that combination of keeping track of what we have and what we've built with the portfolio [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1059.72s)]
*  versus every situation we see and can be at. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1066.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1069.64s)]
*  Well, when I didn't get to your background and how it sort of feeds into your management at Zoma. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1070.28s)]
*  So you gave us a great, you know, you mentioned experience. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1078.44s)]
*  What's the algorithm? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1081.8000000000002s)]
*  What's the black box experience? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1082.52s)]
*  Tell us about your experience leading up to your leadership at Zoma and how it sort of feeds into [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1084.0400000000002s)]
*  what Brad was just talking about that. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1089.88s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1093.64s)]
*  Well, but the intuition is about. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1095.64s)]
*  What I would say is a lot of scars in the back. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1103.0s)]
*  So I spent 16 years as an investor, initially investment banking, sales at research school, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1106.28s)]
*  majority of the time on the buy side. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1110.52s)]
*  I worked for a private equity firm. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1112.2s)]
*  I worked for a very large money manager, the largest money manager in the world [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1113.4s)]
*  and invested in biotech stocks, but also hospital stocks and PBMs and et cetera. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1117.0s)]
*  So I had a pretty good view of just the overall healthcare system, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1122.1200000000001s)]
*  ecosystem. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1125.24s)]
*  And then in 2013, I left and I went to the operating side. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1126.68s)]
*  I worked for a GLP one company before GLP ones were in both. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1129.72s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1132.76s)]
*  I worked for a. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1134.2s)]
*  Had any regrets getting out of that space before it blew up? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1135.32s)]
*  No, no, I would say I grew up playing, doing athletics. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1139.4s)]
*  And I would say that you can't replicate what you have on the operating side. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1144.44s)]
*  You know, in the investment side, you generally operate the chiefs. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1149.88s)]
*  There is a healthcare team and a finance team, a consumer team, et cetera. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1153.0800000000002s)]
*  And it may work for three or four people, but you don't really interact with the other [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1157.0800000000002s)]
*  folks inside the firm. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1160.2s)]
*  You surely do from a social perspective, but not from a business perspective. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1161.24s)]
*  And I would say there's nothing more rewarding than actually putting a drug into human and [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1164.92s)]
*  having it work. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1167.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1168.68s)]
*  And getting calls from families and actual patients to suggest that we've extended our [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1169.0800000000002s)]
*  lives years. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1173.56s)]
*  So that's why I did it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1174.92s)]
*  And I'd be very happy that I made the decision. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1176.3600000000001s)]
*  Every now and then, I'd like to go back to the investing route because, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1179.48s)]
*  you know, as I mentioned before, investing in the operating are very similar. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1184.04s)]
*  Every day there's an alarm fire, fire alarm fire. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1188.76s)]
*  The question is, is it one alarm, five alarm? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1190.84s)]
*  And more often than not, it's one alarm. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1193.4s)]
*  But when it's five alarm in the operating side, it's much more difficult than it is on [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1195.32s)]
*  the investing side. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1199.0s)]
*  The investing side, we just sell. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1200.12s)]
*  We made a mistake and we sell. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1202.68s)]
*  Yeah, I was curious about that. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1203.96s)]
*  What the liquidity sort of factor looks like on the asset, right? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1205.48s)]
*  And is there any catch when you... [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1209.56s)]
*  What? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1211.96s)]
*  If and when you decide to offload an asset, is it any more difficult given the model? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1212.4399999999998s)]
*  Yes, it's a static investment, right? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1219.24s)]
*  It's either all or nothing, generally speaking. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1221.56s)]
*  On occasions, we'll invest in something, we'll make a mistake and we'll actually get the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1224.28s)]
*  asset back. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1227.48s)]
*  But generally speaking, if the asset doesn't work, the asset doesn't work. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1229.0s)]
*  We write it off. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1231.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1233.48s)]
*  So it goes back to my point about the batting percentage relative to the slugging percentage. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1234.04s)]
*  We need to actually maximize the slugging percentage. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1238.44s)]
*  The only way we can do that is actually have a batting average, enough opportunities, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1241.5600000000002s)]
*  because we need to actually diminish the overall risk. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1246.52s)]
*  The only way to diminish risk is you actually have to distribute that risk across a number [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1248.52s)]
*  of investors. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1251.4s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1252.28s)]
*  It does, yeah. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1254.6000000000001s)]
*  So my background is in 16 years on the buy side, sell side, the last 13, 14 years on [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1255.96s)]
*  operating companies. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1261.64s)]
*  I worked at a diabetes company. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1263.4s)]
*  I started my own oncology company. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1264.5200000000002s)]
*  It's public or traded. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1265.88s)]
*  I was the CEO for five years. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1266.76s)]
*  I ran a nephrology company that we exited through a license agreement with a big pharma [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1267.88s)]
*  company. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1272.44s)]
*  And I've worked at venture capital firms. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1273.48s)]
*  I worked at private equity firms. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1275.48s)]
*  I've worked at mutual funds. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1276.92s)]
*  And I've seen the flow from an investment perspective. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1278.3600000000001s)]
*  And at the same time, I've actually operated companies. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1282.2s)]
*  I know what it takes to get a drug to the clinic and ultimately to commercialization. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1284.76s)]
*  And I say that they're both unbelievably hard. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1289.8s)]
*  And it goes back to what Brad was talking about, your question as it relates to risk. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1292.12s)]
*  I'm pretty convinced at this point in time that when you look at assets and clinical data, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1296.6799999999998s)]
*  you can rule things out. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1303.08s)]
*  You can say fairly definitively, I do not believe this drug is going to work. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1305.3999999999999s)]
*  And generally, you're going to be right, because that's what statistics suggest. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1309.6399999999999s)]
*  And generally, you're going to be right. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1313.56s)]
*  So yeah, you're going to be right even if you... [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1315.24s)]
*  You're going to be right for the wrong reason. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1319.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1320.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1320.92s)]
*  But nevertheless, you're right, because 90% of all drugs fail, plus or minus a couple percent here. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1322.28s)]
*  What's more difficult, however, is to rule something in. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1326.92s)]
*  To look at a piece of data and say, I know this drug is going to work. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1330.44s)]
*  Because it may work mechanistically. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1333.8s)]
*  The biology actually may work. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1336.04s)]
*  But there's a human component to drug development, which is execution. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1337.56s)]
*  And what you find is that most drugs that actually don't make it, don't make it because [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1341.0s)]
*  of human execution. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1344.68s)]
*  The people aspect is an unbelievably important fact. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1346.3600000000001s)]
*  It's more important than the actual science. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1348.92s)]
*  I'm pretty convinced at that point in time. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1350.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1352.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1353.0s)]
*  And so when we do deals, generally speaking, much of what we do is actually already been part of it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1353.48s)]
*  And so we're underwriting to the risk of the company that's actually developed the drug, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1360.2s)]
*  not the company that started with the drug, the company that should be currently [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1364.1200000000001s)]
*  executing it on the development time. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1367.16s)]
*  Oftentimes, that is a large pharma company or a very experienced large or mid-cap biotech company. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1369.6399999999999s)]
*  That's not to say that the risk is dimensionless. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1377.08s)]
*  But what I have found is that smaller companies, of which I have been part of, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1379.72s)]
*  unfortunately have participated in, is we cut corners because we don't have the capital [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1385.1599999999999s)]
*  to run the correct studies. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1388.9199999999998s)]
*  And so we're trying to get to the end goal as quickly as possible. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1391.8s)]
*  And we take risks. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1394.76s)]
*  They're all calculated bets. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1396.12s)]
*  Whether it's the trial design, including and excluding criteria, the G-browser scope of the [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1397.8s)]
*  trial, whatever it may be, there's 100 variables. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1402.52s)]
*  But inevitably, you're cutting some corners because you don't necessarily have the capital. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1405.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1408.44s)]
*  So when we think about our business, we can't affect those things. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1409.1599999999999s)]
*  We don't have enough capital to surge or address all the issues that happen in drug development. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1413.96s)]
*  We don't have the skill sets. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1418.28s)]
*  So that goes back to what I was talking before is that we're really just finance [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1419.8799999999999s)]
*  individuals that have some domain knowledge in healthcare. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1423.6399999999999s)]
*  Perhaps biotech specifically. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1427.3200000000002s)]
*  We're trying to provide the principles of financial and portfolio management to [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1429.24s)]
*  the actual biotech space. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1433.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1434.76s)]
*  Not only do we do it from an investment perspective, we also do it just with our own company. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1435.72s)]
*  And we can get into how we finance the company and how we think about our shareholders. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1439.3200000000002s)]
*  But I think the most important thing is at the end of the day, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1443.72s)]
*  is this is an inherently risky business. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1448.44s)]
*  It's probably the most risky business of anything out there today. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1450.8400000000001s)]
*  And we're seeing that reflected in the public markets today because in the 2018-1920 time frame [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1454.76s)]
*  when the cost of capital was zero, not only was the cost of capital zero, but people thought [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1462.04s)]
*  everything was going to work. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1466.9199999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1468.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1469.1599999999999s)]
*  And that's just not the case today. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1469.48s)]
*  We're on the downside of that, which actually to us is actually very beneficial, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1470.6s)]
*  but that's actually where we come in to provide capital to companies. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1473.8799999999999s)]
*  But we have to be very judicious in the investments that we make [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1476.84s)]
*  and the people that we underwrite. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1481.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1483.0s)]
*  What does the company look like from a... [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1483.8s)]
*  Okay, you're talking about applying objectivity to sometimes subjective space [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1485.8s)]
*  and the analysis of both science and people. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1494.76s)]
*  My friend Alan Shaw likes to say you bet on jockeys, not horses, right? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1498.12s)]
*  So we're talking about the teams. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1501.8s)]
*  So how is the company structured to be able to do that, to apply that objectivity to [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1503.56s)]
*  all these facets of potential investments and do it in a knowledgeable fashion? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1510.76s)]
*  Obviously you guys bring great experience between the two of you, but do you have [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1516.52s)]
*  scientific expertise on the team? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1520.52s)]
*  Do you have folks who can dig into the weeds of these papers and the mechanisms of action [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1522.1200000000001s)]
*  and feel good about it prior to the human element, right? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1526.92s)]
*  We certainly do, but I'm not necessarily convinced that what we have is any different [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1531.88s)]
*  than anyone else. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1536.92s)]
*  But I've worked in many different places. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1538.04s)]
*  I've seen what people have. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1540.04s)]
*  Not only do we have people inside, but we also have consultants, we have networks, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1542.28s)]
*  we have honestly hundreds of people that have worked at ZOMA over the course of years who [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  are antibody experts. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1549.56s)]
*  And like I said, go back to what I said before, you can pull things out, but I'm not [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1552.76s)]
*  necessarily sure we can pull things in. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1555.72s)]
*  And so from our perspective with our network to analyze data, scientific assumptions, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1557.8799999999999s)]
*  hypotheses, preclinical data, whatever it may be, we're trying to find just enough [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1563.64s)]
*  information where we can make that rule in versus a rule out of decision. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1568.2800000000002s)]
*  And then once we make that decision, that we turn it over to Brad, because Brad at the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1571.4s)]
*  end of the day, and his team are the structuring experts. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1576.3600000000001s)]
*  The secret sauce of our business is not the scientific evaluation, because I'm absolutely [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1578.8400000000001s)]
*  convinced that there's no one in the world that's actually any better than anyone else. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1582.92s)]
*  Otherwise you would have someone who has significantly better returns than anyone else. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1588.44s)]
*  Yeah, and that's actually not the case today. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1592.92s)]
*  There may be periods of time where you have one particular fund versus another that has [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1595.24s)]
*  significantly better returns, but over a long time period, it was average out. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1599.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1604.2s)]
*  Because we don't understand human biology. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1604.8400000000001s)]
*  It's a dark genome in terms of what we're trying to figure out. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1609.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1613.0s)]
*  So the secret sauce of our business is actually the structuring component. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1613.48s)]
*  So let me have Brad talk about that because that is what I've learned from... [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1617.0s)]
*  I'm not a royalty guy. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1621.48s)]
*  He's a royalty guy. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1623.24s)]
*  He's a real brain. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1624.52s)]
*  He's behind the operation. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1625.16s)]
*  I was just thinking about your comment. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1625.88s)]
*  Though I sat through some sessions at the conference this week, and I've had multiple [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1627.4s)]
*  conversations with biotech founders and builders in the last three days, and conjecturing that [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1631.48s)]
*  there's no one out there that's better than anybody else. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1638.28s)]
*  I'm not sure how that message would be received on the stage at the JP Morgan conference. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1640.44s)]
*  So there's tremendous drug hunters and people that can pick out data. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1645.32s)]
*  But it goes back to what I said before, Louis, which is that's only one aspect of drug development. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1648.76s)]
*  The other aspect is the people. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1653.4s)]
*  I am absolutely convinced that there's no secret sauce actually picking people. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1656.12s)]
*  Relationships matter, networks matter, and that's why you may see some [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1662.28s)]
*  families or ACs do better over a period of time than others. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1666.52s)]
*  May not necessarily be the scientific evaluation. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1669.96s)]
*  It actually may be the human component. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1671.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1673.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1673.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1674.28s)]
*  Maybe we just talk about how we structure things and help when I think of it. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1674.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1679.0s)]
*  I think the key component is we stay humble and we stay realistic. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1679.7199999999998s)]
*  And part of that is realizing that the optimism that we have in this phase of biotech, right? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1683.3999999999999s)]
*  Ultimately, the end goal is to improve human health in some form or fashion. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1690.84s)]
*  But people often overindex on the speed, the timing, the cost, and what the outcome will be. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1695.3999999999999s)]
*  Because they look at comparables as what was the best of, right? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1703.0s)]
*  They're selling their story. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1706.92s)]
*  What we all ultimately think of is what could realistically happen? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1708.84s)]
*  And if that realistically happens, can we do well? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1713.0s)]
*  If it fails, can we be okay? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1717.56s)]
*  If it succeeds and we can power the excess returns, awesome. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1720.12s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1724.12s)]
*  So we can use structuring to kind of solve those elements where [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1725.4s)]
*  we don't make it an acquisition that's far out-sized for the size of our balance sheet [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1729.4s)]
*  and our portfolio, where we look at structure. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1735.0s)]
*  Like when will the next payments come in? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1738.68s)]
*  Is there a way that we can bring some of that capital forward to us [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1741.48s)]
*  so that if the rest fails, we're okay? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1746.52s)]
*  Like if you think about our process, every Bible trial is a one or a zero. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1749.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's hard when you have the gray area. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1755.64s)]
*  I guess there are some 0.5s that people can ask their heads about, but there's the ones and zeros. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1757.56s)]
*  So it's a lot of stacked binary risk on top of each other. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1761.8799999999999s)]
*  So we've got to make sure that we're being cognizant of that and also realistic. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1764.9199999999998s)]
*  The most fun that they have is when we're looking at assets and that's discord amongst the team [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1769.6399999999999s)]
*  because we can't quite figure it out. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1773.3999999999999s)]
*  Someone's following a certain concept or aspect of the deal. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1775.3999999999999s)]
*  Someone like, you know, getting the Tony rumbles about parts of the deal and it's like, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1779.08s)]
*  how do you balance that and figure out how they make the appropriate capital allocation? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1782.9199999999998s)]
*  Our friends at Alston and Byrd set us up with some amazing space to record during JPM week. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1788.2s)]
*  The firm's national health care and life sciences practice has more than a hundred attorneys [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1796.04s)]
*  actively involved in the healthcare industry across the full spectrum of legal disciplines. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1800.84s)]

*  Oh, and you hinted at the investment structure. Like where does the money come from? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1854.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, give us a picture of that. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1861.08s)]
*  Our capital? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1864.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1865.0s)]
*  Yeah. So, so if we want to credit needs to go to our CFO because he's kind of figured out [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1865.48s)]
*  the capital structure of the company. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1870.84s)]
*  Who's in the room by the way with a camera shot? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1873.0s)]
*  I won't fan over there. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1875.72s)]
*  And then a deal that we did that Brad could talk about in a second, but [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1879.8s)]
*  we are extremely conscious of our equity capital structure. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1883.48s)]
*  So if you think about a company, what a company's worth, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1887.8799999999999s)]
*  company's worth, the summation of their cash flows divided by the number of shares outstanding they [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1890.92s)]
*  have. And then the comment I made about drug development and home building is very similar, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1895.72s)]
*  which is it always takes more time. It takes more money. Well, in biotech parlance, that means [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1900.2s)]
*  equity. That doesn't mean you're not going to be successful. It just means that you actually need [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1904.44s)]
*  to generate more cash flow to generate the equivalent dollar per share. And so what we've [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1910.1200000000001s)]
*  done is use a number of financial instruments to bring capital into the company in order to [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1916.12s)]
*  continue to deploy to increase the size of our portfolio. So interestingly enough, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1920.76s)]
*  we have three financial instruments that are publicly traded. We have our common stock [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1927.7199999999998s)]
*  and we have two potential reserves. Those profitable firms yield roughly around eight and a half [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1932.6s)]
*  percent. Despite being the smallest royalty company that's publicly traded, we have the [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1938.6s)]
*  highest dividend yield of any company. So for those investors that want security [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1944.76s)]
*  and a continuous cash flow stream, they can actually buy our perpetual prefers. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1951.0s)]
*  For those people that would like to generate some more alpha, it takes some additional risk, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1956.36s)]
*  they could buy our prefers plus our common stock. In addition to that, we did a very innovative deal [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1960.28s)]
*  in December of 2023. I don't have Brad describe because it was actually his [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1968.2s)]
*  pros to get this done. This is the same type of structuring that we do for our own new royalty [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1973.48s)]
*  acquisitions. I mean, that learning is going to be applied to how we manage company and how we think [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1981.16s)]
*  about dilution. So one of the things that we're thinking about as we're trying to be more active [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1986.6000000000001s)]
*  and help other companies have capital that then separate programs by buying the dinner royalties [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1991.72s)]
*  was how do we build our own balance sheet? And we have royalties. At that point, it was early in [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=1998.28s)]
*  its launch, Roche's advisement for wet AMD, one of the fastest launches in Roche's history. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2004.68s)]
*  And what we set up was a novel recourse loan specifically against a single asset. We partnered [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2011.16s)]
*  with BlueHawk Capital to come up with the structure that basically allowed us to loan that royalty to [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2019.08s)]
*  stream to them for a period of time secured solely by the royalty stream after which time [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2025.56s)]
*  that has paid off, it will be referred back to us. And then that same time, we took that lower cost [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2030.28s)]
*  of capital and are able to then have a full balance sheet and be able to have helpful [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2035.3999999999999s)]
*  conversations. I probably have HAP Morgan now for companies that are seeking ways to [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2041.1599999999999s)]
*  advance our own programs so that we could buy new royalties. Since the kind of 2007 pivot, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2047.48s)]
*  we've had very minimal M&E dilution. We only had 20 million shares outstanding at the point eight. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2054.52s)]
*  So you can imagine a situation whereby we start generating outbording cash flow, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2060.2s)]
*  which should happen hopefully sometime in the near future. And we redeploy that capital not only [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2065.16s)]
*  into new ideas, but also into our own company. And when that does, it levers our future return [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2070.12s)]
*  such that if we're right on assets 11, 16, and 22, instead of generating $2 share income, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2075.8s)]
*  we generate five, A, we've made the right investments, we've also reduced our equity [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2082.84s)]
*  capital base. So in order to get bigger in this environment, you need to get small. I'm a huge [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2087.88s)]
*  proponent of that. If you look at companies that have done very well, in fact, if you look at the [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2093.08s)]
*  best performing companies, the SB 500 over the last 20 years, you're removing a video, which is [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2096.92s)]
*  a friendly technology play. Three companies stand out, IroZone, Dow Jones, and United Healthcare. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2102.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. I would have done the three that I... [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2112.28s)]
*  Let's say me neither. Actually, let me do the analysis. I'll look at the analysis. And [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2114.6000000000004s)]
*  there's one commonality across all three of those companies, that each and every year, they remove [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2118.6800000000003s)]
*  about 5% of their equity cap. Meaning they remove, they buy back shares. Their equity cap structure [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2124.44s)]
*  is being reduced. They're generating three to 5%, maybe sometimes more, maybe sometimes less, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2130.2000000000003s)]
*  revenue growth on an annual basis. And they're leveraging that down to 20, 25% earnings growth. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2136.6000000000004s)]
*  So there's leverage in the P&L. But more importantly, there's leverage from a [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2141.88s)]
*  full-engaged shares outstanding and throwing lower ratio every time, which enables you to generate [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2145.88s)]
*  actually higher earnings per share, which generates a higher PE multiple, which lowers your cost of [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2150.2000000000003s)]
*  capital. So I go back to what I said before, which is that we're just finance guys operating [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2156.1200000000003s)]
*  in a biotech environment where frankly, there's not a lot of fiscal prudence in our environment. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2162.04s)]
*  And we're trying to bring some discipline from our capital structure to this environment. And at the [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2167.8799999999997s)]
*  same time, as Brad mentioned, bringing new drugs to market and allowing people to rebuild wars at [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2173.3999999999996s)]
*  their success and the fruits of their labor in a business that's certainly very difficult. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2179.24s)]
*  CB Yeah. Yeah. This is where I wish Matthew Mamack, the department here at Allison & Bird, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2183.0s)]
*  who was going to join us, but unfortunately couldn't. I wish he was here because I'm curious [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2190.12s)]
*  about the perhaps legal implications or if there's anything you have to be careful about [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2194.76s)]
*  in this model where you're doing some pretty creative things with money. Oftentimes, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2200.84s)]
*  creative things with money puts you in the red zone of potential danger. I mean, is there any [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2205.0s)]
*  risk there? Is there any spiritual consideration? I think the way to think about it legally for a [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2211.88s)]
*  company is it's more complex documentation. That being said, there's a number of councils [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2217.5600000000004s)]
*  that are very experienced in the States now that can shepherd a client through that type of [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2223.88s)]
*  situation. I mean, the way we think about it is ultimately we want to stay out of the company's [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2228.92s)]
*  way. We're a passive recipient of those same future capsules that they would have received. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2235.7200000000003s)]
*  And the whole point is unlike say debt, which would have a lien against all of the assets of [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2242.28s)]
*  the company, this is independent of that. It can be just treated as if someone had sold us a brick [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2248.28s)]
*  of a house and a complete sale of the assets. So it actually fits really synergistically [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2253.8s)]
*  with other types of finances. It doesn't get in the way of different things that they're doing [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2261.32s)]
*  when the product ensures. If they want to pursue other things like sell the company, it doesn't [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2267.0s)]
*  get in the way of a transaction. It's not like blocking or co-present. It doesn't have [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2272.84s)]
*  reporting requirements. We're not sitting on board of directors of companies like if you had say [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2277.56s)]
*  a new venture investor come into your company. So it's the best of both worlds for management [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2282.52s)]
*  teams. It feels very light touch and hand off. For us, it's great. It allows us to [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2289.32s)]
*  put the same information that they would have otherwise gotten from their large pharma or [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2295.8s)]
*  large biotech partner. And it's actually aside from investing the time and doing the work, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2300.84s)]
*  it's quite an elegant solution. Yeah. I'm a bit biased of course, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2308.6800000000003s)]
*  but having run companies, I would sell royalty every day at OBE. Because at the end of the day, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2313.96s)]
*  a 2% royalty is not going to be valued by the partner that I'm selling the asset to. It's [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2322.44s)]
*  immaterial. You can get that through Kong's efficiency and such G&A efficiencies. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2328.2s)]
*  But what it does do, if they miss the dilution to the equity shareholders significantly, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2333.08s)]
*  such that they can actually generate a greater return. So then they can go back to their LPs [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2338.2s)]
*  and return additional capital and that capital goes back into the venture community, spawn new [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2342.04s)]
*  companies. This is a very intense capital intensive business. Yeah. At the extent that you can use [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2346.2s)]
*  capital that's outside of the equity spectrum and not actually be debt because you don't want to [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2353.72s)]
*  lean in your business. The kiss of death in biotech is, in my view, venture debt or converts. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2359.64s)]
*  Do you have to pay those back? And sometimes you can't pay it back. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2367.08s)]
*  From a royalty perspective, where's hitting all the risk? If the asset is not approved, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2372.12s)]
*  it's on us. And there's no downstream implications to the actual equity investors. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2378.28s)]
*  So from our perspective, this is unbelievable piece of paper, not only from our perspective, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2385.4s)]
*  but mainly from the management team and equity holders at the company. They said, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2391.48s)]
*  I would do this each and every day. Yeah. You mentioned that you're entertaining a lot of [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2395.32s)]
*  attention here this week at JPM. What is the appetite for growth of the portfolio at this [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2400.6800000000003s)]
*  point? Brandon, you had it. Well, I think for us, so we're incredibly disciplined about what we do. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2407.0s)]
*  And the most important thing, people are like, how many deals are you going to do in 2025? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2416.28s)]
*  And I think that's the wrong metric. Let's say maybe we do one deal, but it's too long. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2421.24s)]
*  Like, and the right thing that aligns with our investors. So it's not about volume. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2425.96s)]
*  It's about what we're actually creating. But let's hear to your question earlier about, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2430.12s)]
*  like, thinking about a little context of other solutions. So just sort of come back to like, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2438.2000000000003s)]
*  but think about this as interacting with maths for a second. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2441.96s)]
*  Oh, I love math. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2445.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm talking to a company earlier. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2449.4s)]
*  Journalists love math. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2450.6800000000003s)]
*  I hope we can sell it out. But this is where it sounds like that, ah, how long is the why? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2452.68s)]
*  Like, oh, listen, like that is superior. But a company that's publicly traded has a [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2458.7599999999998s)]
*  $150 million market cap. It wants to raise $50 million to give themselves some operating cash [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2464.52s)]
*  flow and turn over the next clinical trial card. If they went to the EPRD community [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2470.3599999999997s)]
*  and did a follow-up, they would be selling a quarter of their company to someone else, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2475.72s)]
*  new investors that now own fractional shares of the company, all the 25% of the company. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2481.56s)]
*  And then if they have partnerships in place, like they're waiting for [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2486.6s)]
*  big milestones or big potential future royalties, they've sold that entitlement to 25% of those [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2490.36s)]
*  academics through that shared dilution. It put more pieces of the pie in place, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2496.92s)]
*  versus what we could do. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2503.24s)]
*  In addition to 25% on everything else that they have. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2504.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2508.44s)]
*  The future pipeline, the creativity, whatever they do. And what we were illustrating to levels out, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2508.68s)]
*  like the type of a deal that Zoma Royalty could do with them means it's focused dilution around [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2515.64s)]
*  the economics on a very specific asset or set of assets. Then they can keep and maintain the rest [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2522.44s)]
*  of the value they're creating across the company. That proprietary pipeline can stay there for [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2529.88s)]
*  proprietary pipeline. So that when hopefully one day the financing environment on the equity [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2534.2s)]
*  side feels healthier, you could raise capital when more people are excited about the space, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2540.68s)]
*  when that's created more value. And so it's a different paradigm. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2546.04s)]
*  Hopefully the math listen too hard. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2551.7999999999997s)]
*  No, not at all. No, no. I get the fundamentals. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2553.24s)]
*  You talked about the investment communities receptivity to the space or us space. That's [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2557.48s)]
*  obviously situational dependent on the biopharmaceutical developer, the biotherapeutic [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2565.88s)]
*  development we're talking about. But we see a lot of frequent ebbing and slowing of interest in [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2570.76s)]
*  RNA and genetic medicine and bispecific antibodies, multi-specific antibodies. There's a du jour [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2578.92s)]
*  that seems like the daily part of that du jour equation is real frequent right now. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2585.96s)]
*  Right? I don't know. What do they call the frequency of waves? There was a time when [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2593.2400000000002s)]
*  there was a little bit more of a swell. So how does that play into what phenomenal looks like, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2598.68s)]
*  to your point, Brad? You said, maybe we do one deal on 25, but it's a phenomenal deal. And I know [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2605.8s)]
*  that there's no hard and fast answer to what phenomenal looks like. But does that [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2611.0s)]
*  make it more difficult for us? It makes it more difficult for us. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2616.68s)]
*  Right. I mean, if you take a step back and think about our space, the ecosystem, the biotech [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2619.24s)]
*  ecosystem, there were 250 publicly traded biotech companies back in the 2005 or 2000 entire train. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2625.8s)]
*  Fund sizes generally were measured in the millions, about billions. And when you have excess [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2635.16s)]
*  profits in any industry, that invites excess diagnostic, which drives downward currents. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2640.68s)]
*  It happens in every industry. And I would make a conjecture that I think that's actually what [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2647.96s)]
*  we're seeing in biotech today. I think there's actually too much capital in our space. I know [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2652.9199999999996s)]
*  people are clamoring for capital. And I know the sidebar conversations here this week are just [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2656.68s)]
*  people aren't investing in biotech, but I actually don't believe that to be the case. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2663.16s)]
*  Hmm. There's a ton of capital concentrated in the private markets. There's very little [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2666.4399999999996s)]
*  capital concentrated in public markets. And ultimately we need to get these companies public [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2671.7999999999997s)]
*  because the duration of the funds that are investing privately are measured in a decade, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2676.04s)]
*  generally speaking, plus or minus a little bit. Yeah. There are some permanent capital structures, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2681.3199999999997s)]
*  but nevertheless the farm, generally the capital is measured in finite time period. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2685.72s)]
*  We need these companies to get public, but frankly, we haven't given the public a great [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2690.3599999999997s)]
*  reason to invest in this system at this point in time. We funded too many companies. There's too [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2694.76s)]
*  much capital to wash, which is driving down their returns. So we're seeing a bit of a washout in the [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2700.6000000000004s)]
*  space. And what the problem that we have when we assign or analyze certain opportunities, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2706.1200000000003s)]
*  the therapeutic density that exists. Just look at 6 CD19 in the oncology space. You've got [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2711.5600000000004s)]
*  isothermic antibodies. You have CAR-Ts. You have across the globe. And at one point in time, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2720.68s)]
*  I believe there are probably over 100 CD19s in development across the different modalities. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2728.52s)]
*  Since you're going after the same indications, that is what we call MAD, that's Mutually Assured [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2734.2799999999997s)]
*  Destruction. That's what we learned in- What was the first thing you were- [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2739.96s)]
*  MAD, M-A-D, Mutually Assured Destruction. That's what we learned in our clinical science 101 class. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2743.16s)]
*  And we're doing it to ourselves. So we as an industry need to be more disciplined in terms [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2749.96s)]
*  of how we allocate the capital. I'm absolutely convinced of that. And when we do that, you're [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2754.52s)]
*  going to see the return skyrocket because of what you said, which is we have all these modalities. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2758.3599999999997s)]
*  Many of them are actually bringing game changing results, both from an FTC perspective, a safety [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2764.2s)]
*  perspective, and ultimately, the patients. There are some who we haven't quite figured it out yet, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2769.7999999999997s)]
*  but that's always the case. If you look at the antibody space, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2775.32s)]
*  it was totally foreign to people in the early 2000s. And yet it's now probably the most [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2778.92s)]
*  efficient way to actually make a drop in how well we can actually do this engineering on the [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2785.1600000000003s)]
*  antibody side. You have the RNA space and you've got the genetic gene therapy space. And what we're [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2791.1600000000003s)]
*  trying to figure out there is how do we deliver all this stuff? And we'll figure it out. It's [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2797.0800000000004s)]
*  just a matter of time. And that's where we need that long duration capital. But the thing that's [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2800.44s)]
*  making it difficult is just excess capital is driving down the returns and creating this [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2805.7200000000003s)]
*  huge therapeutic density. I don't know actually what's going to happen in the obesity sites. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2809.7200000000003s)]
*  What I can tell you is that the amount of capital that's gone in, even if it is the [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2817.64s)]
*  largest therapeutic area, it likely will be just given all the benefits. Of course, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2821.56s)]
*  you have to ask yourself is what are the returns going to be like? And the one thing that's changed [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2826.28s)]
*  in the space today is I'm not quite sure that the clinical side is as important as the commercial [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2831.7200000000003s)]
*  side. Many drugs look very similar. Is there a big difference between 22% weight loss and 24% [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2837.1600000000003s)]
*  weight loss? I don't know. I don't know. But what I do know is that when you get to the commercial [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2844.6800000000003s)]
*  side, there are not even impediments that the PBMs and managed care companies have put up [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2848.76s)]
*  where that 22 versus 24 is probably meaningless. You have to follow the money in their industry. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2853.64s)]
*  And unfortunately, there are very perverse incentives across the entire sector that drive [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2859.72s)]
*  certain behaviors that are not to the benefit of the patient. And ultimately, we need to change [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2865.08s)]
*  that. Hopefully, that will change over time. But there are certain things in the industry that we [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2870.12s)]
*  just need to change ourselves or make this better industry so capital can come back in the right [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2874.2s)]
*  pockets. Does that make sense? It does. Yeah. Yeah. You covered a lot of ground there. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2878.92s)]
*  We started out talking about some of these very specific indications and the impacts of those [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2886.76s)]
*  sort of micro economy and biotech. But I wanted to get your perspectives. When you start talking [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2891.64s)]
*  commercial weight loss drugs and companies in the public markets, now we're talking a little bit [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2897.4s)]
*  more about macroeconomic influences. So I'm curious about maybe some prognostication on what [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2902.2000000000003s)]
*  macroeconomic influences will impact your business model in the coming year. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2909.0s)]
*  Think about things like inflation. You think about things like the election year that we're in, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2914.04s)]
*  the unknowns around who's going to be heading up, FDA and NIH, and so on and so forth. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2918.04s)]
*  Any thoughts on what your management and execution plan might look like in the face of some unknowns [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2925.7200000000003s)]
*  going into 25? I played sports growing up. I played hockey in college. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2932.44s)]
*  Are you Canadian by the way? No, but I sound Canadian. Sometimes you do. Sometimes you do. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2939.16s)]
*  Yeah. A border state maybe? Close? South of the streets is not really a border state. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2943.4s)]
*  You played hockey long enough, you started to sound Canadian. Yeah. I heard that quite often. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2948.52s)]
*  But I had my bell run more than a few times and my father was my coach. He played in college [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2952.6800000000003s)]
*  as well. And he said, son, I'm going to give you one piece of advice, which is you're going to keep [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2958.6s)]
*  your head down, at least have your eyes up. It's the same in our business. We can't worry [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2963.8s)]
*  about actually what's happening externally. We need to be cognizant of it for sure. But the one [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2968.92s)]
*  thing I do know is that great products, great sites and great people will always actually work [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2974.2000000000003s)]
*  to the benefit of patients. It's happened every single time. There's no doubt in my mind it'll [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2979.0800000000004s)]
*  continue to happen. So what we need to do is actually focus on those three components, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2983.4s)]
*  search those out and just structure things appropriately so that we don't put our own [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2988.28s)]
*  company in jeopardy. We could sit here for days talking about regular economics. I love talking [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2992.36s)]
*  about it Tom and I find it interesting and those type of things. But it does affect our industry [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=2997.96s)]
*  for sure. The cost of capital, as you can see, the HBI is essentially inversely correlated to [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3004.36s)]
*  interest rates. But that essentially has always been the case in some respects. You talked about [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3010.44s)]
*  these waves in terms of product development. Well, the same thing happens in the capital markets. And [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3017.7200000000003s)]
*  the two actually kind of set you set up off to each other in many respects. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3021.16s)]
*  But with that all that said, I go back to my father's advice. You just keep your head down, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3027.3999999999996s)]
*  your eyes up and you stick to your business plan. The one thing that we have recognized [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3032.2s)]
*  as we've tried to bring in different things into the business is that sometimes sticking [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3036.8399999999997s)]
*  to your core competencies is actually the best. Yeah. You look at companies that try to go outside [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3041.3199999999997s)]
*  their core competency, more often than not, it's actually a failure and it actually works to the [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3045.7999999999997s)]
*  detriment of their core competency, their core business. So we know what we're relatively good [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3049.0s)]
*  at, which is identifying opportunities that can generate very good returns. Both for the patients [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3053.88s)]
*  that are trying to actually help, but also for the companies that are trying to underwrite. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3059.72s)]
*  And at the same time, very judicious in terms of how we allocate our capital. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3063.88s)]
*  We're the cognizant of our equity structure. And at the end of the day, our business is a [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3068.76s)]
*  functional one thing, just how much cash can we generate? Because if we don't generate cash [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3073.96s)]
*  we're going to lose our shareholders, which means that we can't necessarily put the money to work [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3078.04s)]
*  underwriting these companies that are developing the assets. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3082.28s)]
*  Yeah. What does JPM week mean to you guys? What's your agenda here? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3084.6800000000003s)]
*  Brad, what have you been spending your time doing? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3091.88s)]
*  A lot of communities. Now folks exploring, learning, trying to understand. They've heard [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3093.96s)]
*  about world chemo organization. They're trying to understand how it could be applicable to them. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3099.08s)]
*  There's a huge educational component to what we do. So we have a couple of suites set up in [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3103.4s)]
*  one of the San Francisco hotels and we have pretty much every half hour or in four days. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3107.7200000000003s)]
*  Expensive. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3113.2400000000002s)]
*  Indeed. Yes. I'm staying in one of the lesser expensive. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3116.6800000000003s)]
*  The great thing about Zona is that we have champagne tastes on a beer budget. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3123.32s)]
*  So I've been busy. I'm seeing a lot, learning a lot. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3129.32s)]
*  Keep our ear to the ground. We're always learning because you never know where you're going to find [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3133.0s)]
*  the next piece of information that's going to be insightful. So that's part of it. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3136.52s)]
*  The other part is talking to new investors, helping educate them on your Zona story, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3139.96s)]
*  what we're doing, what our philosophy is as a management team, how we're trying to get great [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3145.0s)]
*  alignment between the management team and the shareholders. Both with the long wind, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3150.04s)]
*  well, it's on the DLXQ short new asset acquisition side and the delivery side. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3155.88s)]
*  For Wall Street, it's all about trust and relationships and doing the right thing. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3162.52s)]
*  So the wall. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3166.2000000000003s)]
*  It's in it. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3166.76s)]
*  Well, the only thing I would say is what is JPM mean to us? It's into what every day means [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3167.26s)]
*  us. It's learning. And you asked what we've done in our career. We actually love to learn. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3174.44s)]
*  There's nothing better than actually meeting. We met with a company yesterday [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3181.1600000000003s)]
*  that is trying to develop an AI system to predict clinical results. I have absolutely no idea whether [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3184.68s)]
*  this will be successful or not. What if it is? Can you imagine the benefit of that? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3190.84s)]
*  No, it would be absolutely groundbreaking. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3197.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3199.32s)]
*  Yeah. Whether it can happen or not, we don't really know. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3199.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. That's a fodder for another podcast. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3201.96s)]
*  Then again, that is that's that podcast. But we meet with probably 10 to 15 companies a day [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3204.2s)]
*  here and probably 10 companies a week more or less. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3212.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3216.9199999999996s)]
*  And the things that we learn are just job-breaking. In fact, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3217.64s)]
*  sure. We were just this one day that was that we were at a meeting yesterday with one of our [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3221.08s)]
*  partners and they mentioned something as it relates to the mechanism of action of a particular drug. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3225.08s)]
*  And essentially our chief scientific officer and I looked at each other and we said, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3230.68s)]
*  that's why the drug works. It's an adverse event. Actually, what differentiates that [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3235.3199999999997s)]
*  drug relative to a competition? We never heard it said in a way that it was said to us. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3241.4s)]
*  Yeah. You learn something. I'm totally like, I wish I knew this two years ago. Amazing. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3246.52s)]
*  It's a whole lot. Let's say to people. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3253.48s)]
*  Sure. It's a good place to do it, but it also reminds me of why this week reminds me of why [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3255.88s)]
*  I would be a terrible investor because I'm so prone to the shiny moments and everybody's shiny [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3261.0s)]
*  at JP Morgan and everyone's putting the best work forward. So it's tricky. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3266.36s)]
*  It's a bit tricky, but I would just say is that if you're in this business, sometimes looking [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3271.0s)]
*  where other people aren't is the best place to look. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3277.32s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I appreciate the time guys. We're running short on it right now, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3280.28s)]
*  but the education that you just need to talk about, the value of coming here to learn. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3286.04s)]
*  I appreciate what you've taught our audience, what you've shared with our audience today. I [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3290.76s)]
*  think it was super beneficial educational conversation. So thank you for that. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3295.16s)]

*  Yeah. Appreciate you guys taking time out of this super busy week to- [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3302.44s)]
*  I hope your audience will appreciate it, but we certainly do. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3305.24s)]
*  I know they will. Yeah. I appreciate it. Owen Hughes, Brad Sitko, Zoma Royalty. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyVAoPejafY&t=3307.24s)]
