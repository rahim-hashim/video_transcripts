*  Welcome back to the Business of Biotech. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=44.0s)]
*  I'm your host Ben Comer, Chief Editor at Life Science Leader, and I'm pleased to speak today with Dr. Mark Eisner, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=46.0s)]
*  Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Veer Biotechnology. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=53.0s)]
*  Mark received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania following a bachelor's degree in human biology at Stanford [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=58.0s)]
*  and went on to complete a residency at the University of California, San Francisco, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=65.0s)]
*  where he stayed on as a researcher and professor for the next 25 plus years. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=70.0s)]
*  And then in 2010, he decamped to Genentech and spent the next 10 years moving up the ranks to become Senior Vice President, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=75.0s)]
*  Global Head of Immunology, Infectious Disease, and Ophthalmology Development. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=83.0s)]
*  Since 2020, he's worked variously as an executive and chief medical officer and as a scientific advisory board member across a handful of companies [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=88.0s)]
*  before joining VeerBio last year. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=97.0s)]
*  I'm excited to speak with Mark today about his career and Veer's change in direction and to get his insights on how to execute a pivot in strategy and development focus. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=100.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming on the podcast, Mark. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=111.0s)]
*  Thanks, Ben. Thanks for inviting me. Excited to be here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=113.0s)]
*  Mark, you worked in academic medicine at UCSF, as I've just mentioned, for nearly 30 years. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=117.0s)]
*  What precipitated your move into product development at Genentech in 2010? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a really good question. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=131.0s)]
*  I mean, when I think about my career and why I went into medicine in the first place, I originally thought I would be taking care of patients one on one and one by one. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=133.0s)]
*  And I did find that really very gratifying. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=143.0s)]
*  But once I was at UCSF and got involved in clinical research, I realized that it was really exciting to be able to answer clinical questions that could help large numbers of patients [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=146.0s)]
*  as opposed to just patients one by one, which is still, of course, extremely important. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=159.0s)]
*  And then when I got the opportunity to go to Genentech, I got really excited because I thought that would be a place where I could make an even bigger impact for patients because of the resources and the ability to test novel therapeutics and really to potentially change how medicine is practiced and help patients on a larger scale. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=164.0s)]
*  So that was why I made the move and why I'm still really excited to be in the biopharma industry. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=187.0s)]
*  Do you ever miss the one on one, you know, as opposed to the kind of once removed one to many versus the one to one or no? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=194.0s)]
*  I do. I mean, you know, I think there is something very special about the interaction of a health care provider with a patient. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=203.0s)]
*  And I think that is something I do miss. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=210.0s)]
*  But, you know, I did do it for a long time and I feel like a lot of the problems that that we're trying to solve here at Veer do ultimately come down to thinking about individual patients and their diseases and the therapeutics that we're trying to develop. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=213.0s)]
*  So I always try to keep that in mind, you know, what the individual patient would want or need. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=227.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. That that makes a lot of sense. And I do want to ask about some of Veer's development programs. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=233.0s)]
*  Hepatitis Delta was sort of a new one for me. So I'm looking forward to, you know, learning some more about about that disease and what Veer is up to in that category. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=240.0s)]
*  You know, across your academic career and your career in industry, you've worked in pulmonary and respiratory disease, now oncology, immunology, infectious disease. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=250.0s)]
*  Is there a disease or therapeutic area that most interests you personally or is there a through line that connects those various fields of research and development? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=261.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think my interest in pulmonary critical care was partly because despite the name, it does involve diseases that affect all organs, all part of the body and requires one to think very broadly about physiology and medicine. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=272.0s)]
*  So I've always been fascinated by, you know, what causes different diseases and how to treat them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=290.0s)]
*  So there's a lot in common between a disease like asthma or rheumatoid arthritis where the immune system is either responding to abnormally to self during an autoimmune way or to an antigen like an environmental antigen in the case of asthma. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=296.0s)]
*  Similarly, you know, an infection like hepatitis delta or a cancer are both essentially foreign invaders and your immune system is not always functioning properly to treat those. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=316.0s)]
*  So that's where I think there's a commonality in what we're trying to do here at Veer, which is to leverage or power the immune system to treat disease and transform the lives of patients. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=331.0s)]
*  You joined Veer as SVP and Chief Medical Officer last June, relatively new on the job. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=343.0s)]
*  That was on the heels of a strategic reorganization that closed a few R&D sites, led to some significant layoffs at the end of 2023. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=352.0s)]
*  But that also led to the acquisition of Sanofi's via Amunix Pharma's three clinical stage masked T cell engagers. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=362.0s)]
*  First off, what can you tell us about the thinking or logic behind the reorganization and acquisition? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=371.0s)]
*  And maybe if you could speak to the challenges that come along with, you know, a pretty decent change in focus there. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=380.0s)]
*  Yeah, so great question. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=388.0s)]
*  So to go back a little bit, I mean, Veer, I think, had a major success rising to the challenge of COVID and the pandemic and developed Sotrovumab in only 15 months, which is really record speed for discovering and developing and getting to market a new, totally novel, therapeutic for COVID. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=391.0s)]
*  But as we all know, the virus continued to evolve and mutate and Sotrovumab was no longer effective, is no longer being used in the U.S. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=413.0s)]
*  or in minimally across the world. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=423.0s)]
*  So the company had to rethink its priorities and its strategy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=426.0s)]
*  And when I joined, it was right at a perfect time because we're right in the middle of those discussions. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=430.0s)]
*  So looking at what are the projects that we have that can really move the needle for patients and what else do we need to bring in to make the pipeline successful? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=436.0s)]
*  So, you know, really prioritizing the programs for hepatitis delta to bevobartin and lepsiran for hepatitis delta, which is going into phase three imminently. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=447.0s)]
*  Thinking about our hepatitis B program and then deprioritizing some of the other programs that weren't really having the same kind of promise for patients. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=459.0s)]
*  And then the process that the company went through that led to the Sanofi T cell Engager platform acquisition was one where hundreds of companies and opportunities were looked at. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=469.0s)]
*  And I think what we were hoping to find and I think we did find is something that had really transformative science, a big potential to help patients, something that was right size for a company of our size and scope to be able to develop. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=481.0s)]
*  And I think what was particularly wonderful is that we also brought in about 50 employees who were mostly former Amunax employees, including those who had developed the technology, the mass TCE technology. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=495.0s)]
*  Those who had developed it and really were enabled us to hit the ground running with those programs. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=510.0s)]
*  So I think that was a really exciting aspect of the deal. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=516.0s)]
*  Were you familiar, Mark, with the science of T cell Engagers prior to starting work on this? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=522.0s)]
*  Was that something that you kind of knew and understood or did you have to learn it following this move? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=530.0s)]
*  I would say yes and yes. I mean, I certainly was familiar with T cell Engagers, but I also had to learn a lot in short order. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=537.0s)]
*  And I think that's part of what I love about working in biotechnology is the challenge because you asked me before about different disease areas and different programs and getting to work in different areas and learn about those is really exciting to me. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=546.0s)]
*  And also bringing in real experts from Santa Fe, formerly Amunax, who can help us really fully understand the platform and how we're optimally going to develop it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=561.0s)]
*  Yeah. And following on that, the Amunax employees came in. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=576.0s)]
*  You have an opportunity to work with them, but I'm curious, maybe from a step back, broader perspective as a new CMO coming into a company to help lead the R&D teams to success, you know, and progressing new modalities for new indications. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=582.0s)]
*  How do you, I guess, how do you motivate and invigorate the teams that you manage, which are, you know, everyone's new to each other at this point? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=601.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's interesting. I think, first of all, for me as a leader, I always keep the patient front and center and try to think about what problem are we trying to solve for the patient as we develop therapeutics for the patient. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=612.0s)]
*  And that's very grounding. And I think that's very inspiring for people who work in R&D and my teams. And, you know, to always try to bring it back to the fundamentals, right? What are we actually trying to achieve? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=629.0s)]
*  But I think also it's around trying to create an environment where people can do their best thinking and their best work and really contribute. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=642.0s)]
*  And that's something that's very, very important to me that I've always strived to do and to create the space where people do feel empowered and feel that they can really contribute in their most optimal way. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=653.0s)]
*  That's also a very important element. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=665.0s)]
*  Are there any specific attributes or kind of characteristics of that kind of environment, you know, that you could mention on kind of a ground floor level? You know, what does that environment look like? How do you create it? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=667.0s)]
*  Yeah, great question. I mean, I think for me, it's around, you know, if I'm leading a team discussion, what I really like to do and I think is important to do is to really ask questions and to make sure everybody is heard from. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=681.0s)]
*  And actually keep a bit back from that and be facilitating a discussion. And usually what happens when one does that is you get people to really express their ideas more fully. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=696.0s)]
*  And usually the solution suggests itself, you know, during that process and as opposed to one where it's very top down and you come in and to say this how we're going to do it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=711.0s)]
*  You know, that that I think is very challenging to not do for someone like me. But I think, you know, I've really that's a skill I really worked on. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=723.0s)]
*  And I think it's really helpful for people to be able to really contribute their best ideas. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=732.0s)]
*  Yeah, in terms of motivating a team, I'm sure that you had to do some of that in your academic career, you know, prior to joining Genentech. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=739.0s)]
*  But I wonder if, you know, if that was and you've mentioned just now that you that was a skill that you built. Were there specific learnings, I guess, or or, you know, situations in your academic career at Genentech that, you know, that served you well on that topic of getting the best and most out of your colleagues now. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=748.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, working in academic medicine, one always has medical students, residents, fellows, people who are learning. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=768.0s)]
*  So, you know, part of the job is to teach people and to, you know, find out what they know and help them learn what they need to learn. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=778.0s)]
*  So I think that that's an important skill I learned in academic medicine. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=786.0s)]
*  But there are some pretty big differences. For example, you know, if I'm attending in the ICU and a patient is having trouble breathing or low blood pressure, I mean, there are times where you just got to basically direct people what to do. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=791.0s)]
*  There's not a lot of time to react. And that's not really a great way typically to lead teams in biotech pharma. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=804.0s)]
*  And, you know, I did have to learn that actually, because I think as opposed to things are much more team oriented in the biotechnology and pharma world than there are in academia where it can be very much driven by an individual principal investigator or attending physician and kind of spend time directing people and setting the priorities. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=812.0s)]
*  But in the biotech world, I learned you got to be much more of a coach and much more of a mentor and really try to work in that way and try to bring out from people, you know, their contributions, which of course could be important in academic medicine too. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=833.0s)]
*  But I think given the very critical nature of cross functional teams in our work here, it's a different skill set that's needed. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=850.0s)]
*  I want to get to hepatitis delta. But before I do, you know, we we already spoke about the, you know, pivot, so to speak, or change in focus and strategy at Veer. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=859.0s)]
*  This is something that, you know, happens at a lot of companies, if not all, if they exist for long enough. Right. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=872.0s)]
*  And I wonder if if you ever went through something like that at Genentech, where there was a, you know, a street strategic reprioritization or, you know, an acquisition that caused some changes to the work that you were doing. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=879.0s)]
*  Have you had to kind of work through that type of situation before? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=893.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course I have. But I think it's it's more. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=897.0s)]
*  I mean, for example, we started out as a product development immunology and then we added infectious disease and added ophthalmology and that required some reshuffling of priorities and thinking, you know, bringing very different groups together. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=902.0s)]
*  I think what's different about what we've had to do at Veer is as a smaller company and as a biotech company, it's a pretty big pivot to go from infectious disease to infectious disease and oncology. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=919.0s)]
*  What I think has helped us is the fact that the underlying need to focus on the immune system and how we target it to treat either an infectious agent like Delta or harnessing T cells to fight cancer. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=932.0s)]
*  There's a thematic connection there. I think also fundamentally at the core of various technology is antibody engineering, which I think is a super important capability that bringing in the T cell gauger platform allows us to think about the next generation of targets. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=947.0s)]
*  But there's no question that reshaping a portfolio and reframing the direction of a company, particularly when our size is very challenging. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=965.0s)]
*  And I think the fact that we were able to bring in the Sanofi employees and integrate them into our teams is super important because it just allowed us not to miss a beat. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=975.0s)]
*  Did those employees actually relocate and are they in the office physically or did they kind of stay where they were and you're working with them remotely? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=987.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, fortunately for us, they were located in South San Francisco about seven miles away. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=998.0s)]
*  So we've brought all those new, we call them Veerites, new Veerites into the office. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  So everybody's here and it's been really, really nice in that way. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1011.0s)]
*  You mentioned the antibody platform, and so maybe we'll just take a minute to discuss this. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  Veer has two discrete platforms for drug discovery and development. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1022.0s)]
*  The data AI structure and antibody or DAISY platform and then the Pro X10 masking platform, the T cell gauger platform that came through the Sanofi Amunix deal. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1026.0s)]
*  Would you mind just telling us what's unique about each of those platforms? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1041.0s)]
*  Sure. Happy to do that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  So DAISY is a AI based platform that allows us to really accelerate and optimize the engineering of antibodies. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1050.0s)]
*  So instead of, you know, taking in a new antibody candidate and doing mutations one by one by one by one, which is a gargantuan task. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1060.0s)]
*  It allows us to leverage extensive databases on protein sequences and develop and prioritize a series of candidates that we can then test to optimize our antibodies. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  So it greatly accelerates and optimizes the way we engineer antibodies. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1085.0s)]
*  The Pro X10 platform is a masking technology that uses large unstructured hydrophilic polypeptides with protein cleavable linkers to mask both the T cell engaging arm and the tumor's binding arm of these T cell gaugers to allow us to achieve a really much better therapeutic index. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1090.0s)]
*  In other words, better efficacy with adequate safety. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1119.0s)]
*  So they're very different approaches and very unique from one another, as you say. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1123.0s)]
*  But I think what's really exciting is that they're complementary, too, because we can use our antibody engineering technology and DAISY to work on the next generation of mass TCE candidates using the masking and the linker technology brought through the platform. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1128.0s)]
*  I see. So you're not necessarily deprioritizing the DAISY platform. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1147.0s)]
*  It's still very much a player in your current current development efforts. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1151.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, they both are very important complementary technology. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1156.0s)]
*  So we're not deprioritizing either. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1160.0s)]
*  We're working on both of them. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1163.0s)]
*  And, you know, because you mentioned it, and it's so much in the news here recently, and I expect will be in the future. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1165.0s)]
*  AI. What is your kind of read on the performance of AI in the DAISY platform? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1174.0s)]
*  You know, have you gotten to a point at Veer yet where AI has been, you could say, extremely helpful in actually getting a candidate from that discovery phase testing and into the clinic? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1183.0s)]
*  I'll leave it open for you. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1198.0s)]
*  You know, what would you say about, you know, the the role of AI, at least in discovery efforts? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1200.0s)]
*  Right. So the specific role of AI in the DAISY platform, I mean, it really does yield tangible advances for us because we can greatly accelerate and optimize the discovery of an antibody and the nomination of it as a lead lead candidate. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1205.0s)]
*  So that that's very important. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1224.0s)]
*  I think in terms of other uses of AI, I mean, we are exploring how we can leverage AI in different aspects of what we do. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a little early to comment and a lot of detail there, but it's clearly something that we're greatly interested in. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1235.0s)]
*  And it includes there are many, many different applications that one could imagine. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1243.0s)]
*  Does with something like the DAISY platform, are you kind of in an iterative way, you know, adding additional components of AI, reviewing new AI technologies to consider to bring in? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1249.0s)]
*  Or do you you have your kind of stack now that you're set with the platform is built and it's working, you know, accomplishing. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1263.0s)]
*  What do you want it to accomplish? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1271.0s)]
*  I'm just curious about, you know, as the field, which is rapidly evolving changes, you know, how what does that interplay look like in terms of the DAISY platform and, you know, emerging tech? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1273.0s)]
*  Sure. So I think we are without particular platform. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1284.0s)]
*  We are constantly evaluating the results and looking at ways to improve how it works. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1288.0s)]
*  So in that sense, it's always going to be an iterative, evolving way of working with that platform. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1297.0s)]
*  You know, so I think that that's important to note in terms of we are very committed generally in how we apply data sciences in all aspects of what we do. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1305.0s)]
*  It's a very rigorous process here. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1317.0s)]
*  We are always thinking about how else can we do things smarter, better with with data technologies. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1320.0s)]
*  So it is a pretty important focus for the company. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1327.0s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1331.0s)]
*  Excellent. I want to get now to hepatitis delta, which didn't at least for me have the same kind of name recognition or visibility generally as hepatitis C or B, for example. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1333.0s)]
*  You are on the cusp of commencing a phase three trial and hepatitis delta. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1346.0s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit more about the disease and and the unmet need that it represents? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1352.0s)]
*  Sure. So as you say, I mean, hepatitis B is a much more common disease. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1359.0s)]
*  I mean, it affects more than a quarter of a billion people around the globe. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1365.0s)]
*  Hepatitis delta is a rare liver disease. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1370.0s)]
*  It's a it's an RNA virus that requires co infection with hepatitis B either previously or at the same time, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1374.0s)]
*  because hepatitis delta uses the hepatitis B surface antigen as part of its lifecycle to construct new virions, new infectious particles. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1384.0s)]
*  So so there is a close interplay between delta and hepatitis B. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1395.0s)]
*  What I think the unmet need is it's a very, very severe liver disease, even though it's a much less common one. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1400.0s)]
*  It can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer and even death rapidly within a five to ten year period. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1407.0s)]
*  So it's a very, very devastating infection. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1415.0s)]
*  And there's not much to offer in the U.S. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1419.0s)]
*  There's no approved therapies for hepatitis delta. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1422.0s)]
*  In Europe, there is one approved therapy, blover, titer, HEP, cluedox, which is an advanced but still, you know, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1425.0s)]
*  there's great need for better treatments for patients. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  Do you know why that one was never approved in the U.S.? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1438.0s)]
*  Well, what we know is that Gilead received a complete response letter from the FDA. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1442.0s)]
*  There's something to do with the manufacturing of the product. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1449.0s)]
*  We do know that it's a daily self injection. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1452.0s)]
*  Patients need to reconstitute a dry powder and self inject. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1456.0s)]
*  There's not a lot more detail that that's been disclosed by Gilead. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1461.0s)]
*  And we also don't know exactly what the timing is for or whether they will resubmit to address the complete response letter in the U.S. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1465.0s)]
*  In Europe, it is being used. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1475.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a drug that's definitely in advance on current standard of care. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1477.0s)]
*  When you think about it, blover tied achieves about a 12 percent complete viral suppression, what we call target not detected, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1483.0s)]
*  no detection of the virus at all for 48 weeks, which is an advance over zero, which is what patients were facing before. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1492.0s)]
*  With our regimen of tibivibart and elapsaran, the combination regimen, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1502.0s)]
*  we believe we can treat the majority of patients and get them to target not detected or complete viral suppression. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1507.0s)]
*  And Alnylam is a partner on your hepatitis delta and hepatitis B clinical programs. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1514.0s)]
*  What can you say about about how that partnership came about? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1522.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Alnylam discovered elapsaran, which is the SIRNA component of our regimen. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  So in that sense, it's very important. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1534.0s)]
*  I think it speaks to the importance of partnerships and finding external innovation. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  Another example is the aminexanaphy external innovation that we brought in. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  And just I think how important partnering is for biofarmers generally, but but very specifically. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1548.0s)]
*  And we're very excited to have elapsaran as part of our regimen for hepatitis delta and hepatitis B. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1555.0s)]
*  Is there anything else? I know you have a partnership with GSK and respiratory disease. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1562.0s)]
*  Is there anything else you would say, Mark, about VIIRS more broadly, I guess, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1567.0s)]
*  approach to partnering in terms of, you know, partner selection and timing? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1573.0s)]
*  Yeah, so absolutely. I mean, I think it's maybe a little bit under recognized in the biopharma industry or maybe in the general public. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1578.0s)]
*  But how critical partnering is both to bring in external innovation and part of a competitive advantage we have at VIIRS, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1587.0s)]
*  I think we are able to see what great scientific innovation looks like. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1595.0s)]
*  And that would be the example would be the TCE platform that we brought in. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1600.0s)]
*  But also to work with a partner like GSK, where, you know, VIIRS was able to discover and bring this [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1604.0s)]
*  Sotrovumab to patients in 15 months, but then to have a partner like GSK with a global footprint, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1611.0s)]
*  with the expertise and infectious and respiratory disease marketing and to work together to get this drug to the patients during a pandemic and just treat and save many, many, many lives. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1617.0s)]
*  I think that was a testimony to how well VIIRS was able to identify and work with a big pharma partner. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1626.0s)]
*  Yeah, and we talked about VIIRS new focus, which is infectious disease as well as oncology. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1633.0s)]
*  So I'd like to ask now about the oncology indications that you're pursuing and what kinds of milestones that you're currently working toward in oncology? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1639.0s)]
*  Sure. So I think that's a great question. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1648.0s)]
*  I think that's a great question. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1651.0s)]
*  So I think maybe it's helpful to start with what is the problem statement. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1653.0s)]
*  So the problem statement for unmasked T cell engagers, which are approved for various targets in the liquid tumor hematology space. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1656.0s)]
*  But for solid tumors, they've just been too toxic, like unmasked HER2 or PSMA-directed T cell. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1666.0s)]
*  Engagers have caused cytokine release syndrome where patients develop respiratory compromise, hypotension, shock, and they just haven't been viable therapeutics for solid tumors because of the toxicity. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1674.0s)]
*  So the technology of the masking with the pro-extend plasma, which is a very common, very common way to do this, is to have a very high level of protection. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1686.0s)]
*  So the technology of the masking with the pro-extend platform, which allows us to have a molecules that are masked in the normal tissue in the blood, so pretty much inactive. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1697.0s)]
*  But when they get into the tumor microenvironment, proteases in the tumor microenvironment cleave off the masks and activate the molecules, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1707.0s)]
*  allowing them to form an immune synapse between the T cell and the tumor cell and kill the tumor cell very effectively. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1717.0s)]
*  So that's, I think, fundamentally what's exciting about the masking technology and how it can improve therapeutic index. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1725.0s)]
*  So we have three clinical stage programs. One is the 5818 program. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1733.0s)]
*  Sorry. Yeah, 5818 program, which is the HER2-directed T cell Engager, which is potentially applicable to a variety of HER2-positive tumors, including colorectal cancer, where we presented some exciting data at a recent Investor event, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1740.0s)]
*  metastatic breast cancer, there are other HER2-positive tumors that are present in the T cell. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1750.0s)]
*  And we're doing a basket trial, phase one dose escalation trial, where we are testing it out in different tumor types. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  The 5500 program is directed at PSMA, which is an important tumor that is being tested in the T cell. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1768.0s)]
*  So we're currently testing this in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, and we're escalating the dose there, both in Q weekly and Q3 weekly scenarios, because we want to get to a point where we can potentially treat the T cell. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1778.0s)]
*  So we're doing a basket trial, phase two, where we're testing it out in different tumor types. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1788.0s)]
*  And then the last one is our TCE targeting EGFR, which is a very, very broad antigen in multiple tumor types, including non-smell cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1798.0s)]
*  And we are planning to start phase one, phase two, where we're going to be testing it out in the T cell. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1808.0s)]
*  Excellent. I wanted to ask a question about the HER2 target. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1818.0s)]
*  I was speaking with the CEO of a smaller biotech that's working in oncology. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1824.0s)]
*  And a point that he made to me was that the fundamental problem in cancer is that we have a very broad antigen in multiple tumor types, including non-smell cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1830.0s)]
*  And this company is working on a kind of logic gating technology that will essentially include multiple receptors turned on and off according to sensing a healthy cell. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1838.0s)]
*  And so I think that's a very broad target. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1848.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very broad target. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1852.0s)]
*  And this company is working on a kind of logic gating technology that will essentially include multiple receptors turned on and off according to sensing a healthy cell versus a cancer cell. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1856.0s)]
*  And the point that he made to me was that a target like HER2 is becoming increasingly crowded, people throwing a lot of different modalities at it. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1866.0s)]
*  Because it's a target where, in a sense, I guess, maybe your therapy can kill somewhat indiscriminately. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1876.0s)]
*  Now, what you're saying with the massing technology adds some nuance to that. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1882.0s)]
*  But I wonder, is that thinking about the next big leap in cancer therapeutics? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1888.0s)]
*  Is it being able to, you know, be able to do that? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1896.0s)]
*  Is it being able to kill cancer cells, kill cancer without the resulting toxicities? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1902.0s)]
*  Do you see that as the current limitation or would you give another explanation for what's needed, I guess, for the next big cancer breakthrough? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1912.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's an excellent question. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1922.0s)]
*  And I do think that the specificity is super important here in the masking in particular, which allows this mass T cell engager approach to work because it allows us to dose escalate to doses that can start to be effective in killing the tumor. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1924.0s)]
*  So in HER2, it can bind the HER2 positive tumor cell and the T cell and promote the T cell killing of the HER2 positive tumor cell. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1946.0s)]
*  Normal tissues like heart and lung tissues can express HER2. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1956.0s)]
*  So to your point, we don't want to activate the T cell engager in normal lung tissue, normal heart tissue at all, because that just brings toxicity. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1961.0s)]
*  So I think what we've been able to show so far in our public data disclosures is that we can dose these massed molecules, these mass T cell engagers high enough to start killing tumors while maintaining an adequate safety. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1971.0s)]
*  So only sort of minimal cytokine release syndrome. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1985.0s)]
*  And for example, one of the patients we presented was a woman who had very advanced breast cancer that was infiltrating her skin in two different ways. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1988.0s)]
*  And she had been treated with nine prior lines of treatment, including in HER2, which is a recently approved HER2 drug to treatment. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=1997.0s)]
*  And you could literally see visually this tumor just clear from her skin with 5818 over a five to 10 week period. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2006.0s)]
*  So it's unequivocally had clinical activity in this patient who had been through multiple, multiple other options. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2017.0s)]
*  And so I think it's case and back to our earlier discussion around individual patients. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2025.0s)]
*  I mean, we obviously need to demonstrate the effects that these are safe and effective in populations of patients. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2031.0s)]
*  But sometimes it's a patient like that, that really informs us that we're on the right track with it with a treatment. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2037.0s)]
*  Right. And we have other patients as well. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2044.0s)]
*  There's a colorectal patient who got this treatment, who's been on drug for more than 18 months and has been very, very stable. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2047.0s)]
*  And another prostate cancer patient on the 5500 program where they've had a very sustained suppression of their PSA. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2056.0s)]
*  Your resolution of bony lesions on MRI. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2065.0s)]
*  And it's patients like that to really tell us that we're on the right course. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2068.0s)]
*  And I think also for for the teams, it's just really inspiring to see those patients kind of get back to more normal lives. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2072.0s)]
*  And it just makes us want to keep working on this and and advance the programs. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2080.0s)]
*  Looking looking forward into the future now. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2086.0s)]
*  Now, Veer has completed this this pivot. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2090.0s)]
*  You're focused on oncology. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2093.0s)]
*  You're focused on hepatitis B, hepatitis delta. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2094.0s)]
*  What, I guess, are your your top goals for 2025 and maybe 2026? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  And and if you would, you know, what do you see as the biggest challenge? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2104.0s)]
*  Sure. So, I mean, 2025 for us is a very important year for execution. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2109.0s)]
*  I mean, on the hepatitis delta program, we are starting three pivotal trials and we're going to be enrolling our first patient in the first half of this year. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2116.0s)]
*  So that's a laser focus for us and the team is getting those trials up and running on the key cell engagers side. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2126.0s)]
*  It's continued dose escalation for the HER2 and PSMA programs and getting the EGFR program into the hospital. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2136.0s)]
*  We're getting the EGFR program into the clinic, continuing to show what efficacy we can get, you know, with with acceptable safety, minimal CRS and other acceptable safety profiles. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2144.0s)]
*  So it's around really executing on those programs. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2158.0s)]
*  I think also, you know, on the research side, it's using the the antibody discovery platform with Daisy and the Mast ProExtend platform to work on the next generation of tumor targets and to work on, you know, in the research discovery space. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2161.0s)]
*  You know, what's going to come next, you know, besides the clinical stage assets that we currently have. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2178.0s)]
*  And then the last thing I would mention is we are, you know, going to have functional cure data for hepatitis B March Phase 2 study coming in quarter two of this year. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2184.0s)]
*  And we're really excited about that. The data at the end of treatment were really exciting. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2196.0s)]
*  And we are we are what we have said is we're looking for a partner to advance that one into further development because it's it's a large program. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2203.0s)]
*  It's going to require a lot of resources. And that's a place where I think a strategic partner to develop that globally, you know, really, really be important for us to find. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2210.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that that raises a new question for me, which is when do you get started on the global development efforts? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2222.0s)]
*  Do you you know, is it after this next kind of phase readout and then you decide, yes, we're going for, you know, we're going to look for a partner. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2230.0s)]
*  We're going to begin development efforts elsewhere. Maybe you're already in, you know, multi center locations around the world. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2239.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. But can you give me a sense of your kind of global ambitions for that product given, you know, that it's a really large indication? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2245.0s)]
*  Sure. So, yes. So we certainly have started planning of what the next phase of clinical development would look like, the trial designs with the next regulatory interactions that we would have. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2253.0s)]
*  But and we've started thinking about and talking to prospective partners. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2266.0s)]
*  I think this will be a process over time where, you know, our aspiration, if the data can support the continued development of the functional cure point, which is, of course, fundamental, you know, we need that would be to find a partner who would then work through that with us and then ultimately take over that phase of development for B while we fully own and develop the hepatitis delta trials ourselves. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2272.0s)]
*  Got it. All right. That is Dr. Mark Eisner, senior vice president and chief medical officer at Veer Biotechnology. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCxtipe1bQ&t=2297.0s)]
