Video Description: For all the drug commercialization successes he's played a leading hand in during his tenures at GSK, Genentech, and ImClone—Androderm, Augmentin, necitumumab, and Erbitux among them—Michael Bailey concedes that he's likely better known for his failures. After hearing his stories on this episode of the Business of Biotech, I tend to disagree. While he offers a transparent and instructive look at the failures themselves, I'd contend it's what he's done with those setbacks that defines his biopharma and biotech leadership legacy. Today, Bailey is CEO at Aveo Oncology, a company that saw its own set of challenges during the clinical development of now-commercial FOTIVDA (tivozanib) and ficlatuzumab. Tune in for Bailey's straight-shooting insight on how to turn biotech setbacks on their ear.

# Steering Through Setbacks with AVEO Oncology's Michael Bailey
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [August 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE)
*  Michael Bailey got his start in biopharma sales and marketing a few moons ago, kicking off his career at GSK before making a move to Genentech, where he was group manager of cardiovascular programs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=0.0s)]
*  And then Mclone, now Eli Lilly, where he was senior VP of commercial operations. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=16.0s)]
*  Collectively, those three stints comprised the first 16 years of his career, and during that climb he worked with and led teams that notched up a lot of antibody wins. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=22.0s)]
*  He joined Cinta Pharmaceuticals, which since merged with Madrigal, before he became chief commercial officer at Aveo Oncology in 2010, chief business officer there in 2013, and now CEO since 2015. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=34.0s)]
*  That tenure brought another win in Fortevda in the advance of multiple more late phase antibodies that are in the commercial preparation queue today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=56.0s)]
*  While Michael has many winning credits to his name, he's also faced and overcome a lot of adversity along the way. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=67.0s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business of Biotech, and on today's show, we're digging into some of the stories of commercial perseverance with Aveo Oncology CEO Michael Bailey. Michael, welcome to the show. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=76.0s)]
*  Thank you, Matt. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=88.0s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you here, and I'm glad you made the time for us. And I want to get into some biographical info on you. We're going to kind of shelve that for a minute and get right into the quick of the discussion here, if that's cool. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=89.0s)]
*  Looking over your CV and your wins column, so to speak, it's impressive. I mean, a biotech builder can go a long time, a lot of years, an entire career maybe, still making fantastic contributions to the space, to the science, but go winless. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=104.0s)]
*  You've played a hand in what, from my perspective, looks like an above average number of commercial successes during your career. And the first thing I wonder is, as you traverse, kind of navigate your career, are you keeping a wins loss column somewhere? Are you keeping some hash mark somewhere along the way? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=124.0s)]
*  First of all, Matt, again, thank you for inviting me to appear on your show. And like everybody, I've got memories of my successes and failures. I think I'm probably better known for my failures, although I have logged up quite a few successes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=147.0s)]
*  But the reason I'm better known probably for my failures is that it's what you learn from those challenging experiences. And I think that's what people are looking for is in this business, you're going to run into those kind of challenges. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=165.0s)]
*  And one of the things I think my experience provides is just how to work your way through that. With that, I was extremely privileged, as you mentioned, a lot of wins to work on some amazing, amazing products. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=178.0s)]
*  I know all of these serve to improve the lives of patients. As you mentioned, at SmithKline Beecham, I led the launch of Andraderm, which is our first testosterone product. I was on the Augmentin commercial team. And if you have kids, everybody knows Augmentin for otitis media, sinusitis. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=195.0s)]
*  We did a major repositioning initiative on that. In addition, I had an opportunity there to do a rotation in the field where I got to launch Relafint, which was for arthritis. So got to see kind of a lot of different perspectives, stages in product life cycles. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=215.0s)]
*  As you mentioned, I went to Genentech. There I worked really in new products where I think it was really important to bring the customer to the development process. And I worked on a next generation thrombolytic called TNKs that was ultimately launched. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=233.0s)]
*  And as mentioned, worked at ImClone for their first launch, which is always an exciting event at a company, Herbatux, and then their follow on Nestoon Lab. Herbatux went on to be a blockbuster. So that was a pretty exciting event. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=250.0s)]
*  But as far as my most recent success with it is with Aveo, but it was preceded by a significant setback. And again, those are the things you really remember. But overcoming that setback and kind of charting a path forward, which included not only securing funding for additional pivotal studies, but ultimately getting the first product approval for the company in a subsequent launch in 2021. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=265.0s)]
*  And just not to make it even more complicated, we launched in the middle of COVID. And, you know, despite it, very proud to say that despite launching in the middle of COVID, and despite the setbacks earlier, we I believe we executed on a flawless launch. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=293.0s)]
*  And we're ultimately recognized by ZS as one of the best launches of the year. Follow that on with this success caught the eye of LG Chem, who ultimately became our parent company. And they were looking for a proven ontology commercial organization to acquire. And I feel like that this is one of my biggest and most proud accomplishments, if you will, which is the resulting deal. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=309.0s)]
*  Which, which I've defined as a kind of win, win, win. So, you know, if you can get a win, win, that's great. If you can get a win, win, win, that's amazing. And let me describe what I mean by win, win, win. We want to develop our pipeline, we didn't have the funding or the investor advocacy, if you will. So LG was willing to provide that so we really won for the patience because we're moving our important portfolio forward. My team, my employees who got us to where we we are, we're all retired. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=339.0s)]
*  We're all retained. So when it was win for the employees and was one of the fastest growing stocks in in the year that the acquisition occurred. So our shareholders won. So a really nice win, win, win for everybody. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=369.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's outstanding. I'm curious, and I've asked this question of biotech builders before, who have been in similar positions, having come from BigBio and been on big teams that, you know, having played a hand in the launch, the commercial success of therapeutics and BigBio, and then moving to biotech and taking a small company, a small team that perhaps had, you know, those investor challenges and more. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=382.0s)]
*  And winning there to contrast those for me, like personally for you and for your team, the the the the feeling, the the sense of accomplishment, you know, contrast that between BigBio and biotech. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=412.0s)]
*  Well, I would say that the biggest contrast is in biotech. It's it's survival. Where I'm big pharma, maybe it's it's growth and share price and some of those other things. So, you know, when we set out as kind of the turnaround of AVEA, we had a small team we called the go forward team and there's 20 people down from a company that was roughly 260 people. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=431.0s)]
*  And our strategy, you know, top line was to survive. And that, you know, obviously part of that is survive while we're progressing our agent to through the clinic and then ultimately to to the patients. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=459.0s)]
*  But I would say that's the biggest thing. There's an incredible amount of stability that, you know, I think big pharma affords because they've got a huge portfolio of products where most of the small biotechs are going to be one product and it's do or die. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=476.0s)]
*  You've got to make the right decisions. You've got to be fiscally responsible to to maintain that kind of lifeline or that that runway to be able to achieve the clinical results from your study. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=488.0s)]
*  And, you know, like I said, I think big pharma has a little more of a luxury there. You know, as I think about the LG collaboration, we have the best of both worlds now because we we operate as a biotech. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=504.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of kind of innovation, excitement, a lot of, you know, nimbleness, risk taking ability to do all those things. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=516.0s)]
*  And now we have this parent company LG who's got incredible financial security and that works as a safety net. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=526.0s)]
*  So I feel like we've gotten to the best of both worlds. The biotech spirit with the, you know, the stability of a big pharma. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=534.0s)]
*  And I would say, you know, I've been in this situation before when I was at Genentech when Roche came in and had acquired them, but they let them live that spirit of biotech that really, I think, creates innovation and advances science. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=543.0s)]
*  Particularly when you're, you know, with Genentech pre Roche when you're at Mclone now, now with Veo pre LG acquisition. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=560.0s)]
*  What is it that I mean, to your point, when you're working in big bio, you know, failures the norm across the board, whether you're a big bio biotech in this business, the losses almost always outnumber the wins. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=570.0s)]
*  But when you're in small bio and you don't win, you know, when you encounter a setback, when you kill a program, when you need to pivot, it can be deflating. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=583.0s)]
*  I mean, just human to human. It can be deflating. Right. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=593.0s)]
*  What keeps you as the leader in those organizations motivated to keep moving forward when things don't end well and when they don't end well in small bio, they can end well, you know, in a pretty dramatic or they can end unwell in a pretty dramatic fashion. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=597.0s)]
*  Yeah, so first, I would 100% agree. This is tough business, a high rate of failures, your losses are going to outnumber your wins. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=612.0s)]
*  Hopefully they won't outweigh your wins. And I think it's kind of ties to how you deal with your losses. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=623.0s)]
*  But one of the things we have to keep in mind, and I always remind my employees and they remind me, is that it's a privilege to work in this industry. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=629.0s)]
*  We're doing something incredible that's going to touch countless lives, change families lives, extend life. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=638.0s)]
*  And that's a really important thing. And I don't think there could be a better job in the world. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=647.0s)]
*  That's my personal opinion. And I believe that I share that with most of the people who dedicate their careers to this type of patient focused mission. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=652.0s)]
*  And that concept of mission, I think, is really important because I want to get back to your specific question. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=661.0s)]
*  What do you do when you have a setback? And I think the simple answer is you focus back on why we're doing what we're doing. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=666.0s)]
*  So, you know, as I thought about taking this CEO job after a major setback in the company, I asked myself kind of what are the reasons I'm doing this? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=674.0s)]
*  And the first thing is always got to be patients. We're doing this because we think that what we're developing is going to improve the lives of patients. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=685.0s)]
*  And on top of that, there was a career aspect of it. First time CEO. That's a wonderful thing. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=693.0s)]
*  And then, you know, if you're really successful in biotech, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to generate wealth. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=699.0s)]
*  Well, you know, if I think about all those three things through my career, through this, you know, this journey of being a CEO, there's been days I woke up and said my career is over. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=705.0s)]
*  I have just made the worst mistake of my life. And that's the personal insight I was looking for. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=717.0s)]
*  Yeah. And there's no way I'm going to make any money here. And, you know, my shareholders are going to hate me and all that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=724.0s)]
*  But, you know, the thing that got you out of bed was saying, I believe in the product. I know the data. We just have to get through this and make it happen. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=731.0s)]
*  And, you know, that's the kind of thing that really gets a team that's mission focused moving forward. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=741.0s)]
*  I kind of think about it as the heart and the head. The heart is that, you know, that that mission focus. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=749.0s)]
*  And we really want to make sure we're doing it. But the head part of this is really important. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=757.0s)]
*  We have to make prudent decisions and we have to make thoughtful decisions. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=761.0s)]
*  We can talk more about kind of philosophies about making decisions. But one of my philosophies is all about know the data. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=765.0s)]
*  Do the homework. Listen to your advisors. Listen to your employees. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=773.0s)]
*  The whole concept of diversity that we hear a lot about to me is diversity in thought. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=778.0s)]
*  And that diversity in thought comes from diversity in race, gender, experiences, religion, all those kind of things. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=784.0s)]
*  But it's the idea of getting that full kind of 360 perspective on the important challenges that you're facing and listening to those. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=791.0s)]
*  And I think too often people listen to themselves and not to others. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=802.0s)]
*  And that can create kind of, if you will, limited thought process. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=808.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just for context and clarity, you've referenced a couple of times now a setback at Aveo. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=813.0s)]
*  Can you share a little bit about that, what that setback was? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=820.0s)]
*  And I'll start with setting up with I had two kind of major setbacks and the similarities were actually uncanny. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=824.0s)]
*  I think getting through the second one was a result of having gone through the first one. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=833.0s)]
*  So when I was at Inclin, we got an RTF for the first drug, Urbitux, when it was first filed. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=839.0s)]
*  And that was largely because I think there was a lack of active listening. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=847.0s)]
*  The FDA was saying, hey, I got concerns, da, da, da, da. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=852.0s)]
*  But I think the team at the time was listening and saying, I want to hear what I want to hear, which is this is green light, full speed ahead. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=855.0s)]
*  They filed and then they got an RTF. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=865.0s)]
*  Ultimately, that was a very important period of time in my life because a lot of people left the company, as you might imagine. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=869.0s)]
*  The company had gone down. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=877.0s)]
*  There was a lot of bad press that went along with that. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=878.0s)]
*  But if you looked at this honestly, it was clearly a drug that worked, that had a bad study designer. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=882.0s)]
*  It was in this case, it was just not adequate study designer and not adequate data to be able to get the FDA approval. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=891.0s)]
*  Long story short, persevering through, we ended up launching the product and ultimately sold the company, as you mentioned, to Eli Lilly. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=898.0s)]
*  For seven billion dollars. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=906.0s)]
*  So that kind of failure turned into a success. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=907.0s)]
*  Now, you know, fast forward to May of 2013, I've just recently joined Aveo as a chief commercial officer. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=910.0s)]
*  The data reads out. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=918.0s)]
*  It met its primary endpoint, but there was a study design, one way crossover, not to get into too much detail, but that confounded. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=920.0s)]
*  One of the secondary endpoints that the FDA was very keen on, which was overall survival. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=928.0s)]
*  So we didn't show what we hope to show on the overall survival. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=933.0s)]
*  Long story short, we ended up getting what's called a complete response letter, as many of your biotech listeners would understand what that is. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=937.0s)]
*  And what a major setback. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=945.0s)]
*  So at that point, our global partner exited, just literally dropped the contract on the door and said, we're done. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=948.0s)]
*  And then the management at the time decided to shelve the product. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=958.0s)]
*  And I really did not necessarily agree with that. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=963.0s)]
*  I actually moved to a chief business officer, tried to spin the oncology products, including to Tavosinib, which was one that got the complete response, spin it out. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=966.0s)]
*  But long story short, in about 2020, 2014, I really crafted thought about all the all that had happened, acknowledged the mistakes that were made and tried to look beyond this failure to identify a clear path forward for this really important drug that provides efficacy combined with tolerability. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=977.0s)]
*  So again, square in our mission of improving the lives of patients with cancer. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1001.0s)]
*  And that's really what really motivated me was this was something that was aligned with our mission. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1006.0s)]
*  And we owed it to the patients to bring this therapy to them and provide a product option that does provide both efficacy and safety. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1012.0s)]
*  So in 2014, after being chief business officer about for about a year, I shared my proposed strategy with the board. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1022.0s)]
*  And ultimately, in 2015, I was appointed CEO of Aveo. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1030.0s)]
*  So kind of instead of folding up on the TIVDA, we decided to focus on the mission set out on what we knew was an arduous going to be an arduous path to raising capital, executing on another phase three study, which was the TIVO three. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1035.0s)]
*  And then ultimately launching and God knows we could never have anticipated that we'd be launching into in the midst of a global pandemic where you can't actually see your customers. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1052.0s)]
*  So, yeah, it was, you know, obviously, in the end, grateful we didn't fold it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1062.0s)]
*  And but I'll be the first to say it wasn't an easy journey. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1070.0s)]
*  But I will say it was worth it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1074.0s)]
*  And, you know, another important thing, one can say, gosh, you got lucky. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1076.0s)]
*  And we did. I'm not going to deny that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1081.0s)]
*  But at the same time, I firmly believe luck favors the prepared mind. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1084.0s)]
*  And our little go forward team of 20 people were prepared to take on all the challenges we had to take on. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1089.0s)]
*  And we got to where we needed to go. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1097.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1099.0s)]
*  In that anecdote alone, those two anecdotes, those two stories collectively shed a little bit of light on any number of challenges, some preventable, some completely unforeseen. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1100.0s)]
*  I mean, you talk, you know, you talk about COVID like there's a challenge that nobody saw coming. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1114.0s)]
*  And, you know, at the end of 2020 and all of a sudden in 21, everything goes to hell in a handbasket. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1118.0s)]
*  Looking back on that, you know, looking back on the things that can influence success or failure, the things that more pointedly can indicate imminent failure, human biology, funding, competition, the regulatory environment, as I said, unforeseen things like global pandemics. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1125.0s)]
*  Looking back, can you, if you were going to advise our audience on some of the things that maybe are foreseeable that are the most formidable challenges a biotech leader might face. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1147.0s)]
*  I mean, can you, is it even possible to say, well, you know, there's a handful of things that are. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1163.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny when you start thinking about, you know, what are the things that a biotech executive is challenged with. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1170.0s)]
*  Well, you know, there's all the know that you better know your market, you better know the data, you better know the science. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1180.0s)]
*  But, you know, at the end of the day, it really comes down to people. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1185.0s)]
*  And, you know, having the right people around you, keeping them motivated, especially as I mean, look, this is a slow moving business. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1191.0s)]
*  You do a phase three study, it can be three years where you're sitting there waiting for the card to turn over and you've got to, you know, really be driven during that period of time while you're waiting the uncertainty. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1202.0s)]
*  And then you get, you know, market dynamics that come in, financial concerns, you've got competitive news that comes out. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1215.0s)]
*  So, again, I don't mean to be too simplistic, but it comes back to really refocusing people on the mission. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1223.0s)]
*  What, you know, someone very wise once told me as you're in your CEO role, every opportunity you get to state the mission, which is to improve the lives of patients with cancer. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1232.0s)]
*  I think I've probably said it a half dozen times already and I apologize for that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1244.0s)]
*  Something you should never apologize for. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1248.0s)]
*  It rolls off the tongue and it is truly, you know, the thing that keeps people focused because when you start getting distracted about a variety of things and, you know, it's easy to lose perspective. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1253.0s)]
*  And when you keep that simple perspective in place, you're going to be in a much better position. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1267.0s)]
*  The other thing, you know, look, as a CEO, you kind of feel every bump in the road. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1272.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's important that you keep what I refer to and it's actually one of our core cultures is realistic optimism. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1278.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear you say, oh, everything's going to be all right. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1288.0s)]
*  Don't worry as you're going over the edge of a waterfall. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1293.0s)]
*  But, you know, keeping that realistic optimism, transparency, being able to share with your employees the risks, the challenges that we have and understand what we need to overcome them, I think is really important. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1296.0s)]
*  The other thing, again, and I'll kind of put the CEO hat in is just, gosh, there's so many stresses in what we do. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1310.0s)]
*  And one of the things that I do, kind of two things to try to manage stress. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1321.0s)]
*  One is I try to keep a good work life balance. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1326.0s)]
*  Part of that is trying to be healthy, at least get some exercise, do something other than just working 14, 20 hours a day, which you absolutely could do as a CEO. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1330.0s)]
*  And the other thing is, have fun. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1341.0s)]
*  I learned how to work hard, play hard mentality, but a good laugh, a couple of beers with your colleagues. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1344.0s)]
*  Those are the kind of things that just make it say, yeah, I'm this is OK. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1354.0s)]
*  I feel good about what I'm doing. I enjoy the people I'm with. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1360.0s)]
*  So it's important, you know, as a CEO, to set that tone. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1365.0s)]
*  I wear shorts. I just put my jacket on for this. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1369.0s)]
*  But I wear shorts to work and Hawaiian shirts just to kind of make sure everybody knows, hey, what's really important is the work we're doing. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1372.0s)]
*  Enjoy yourself on the journey. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1383.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you don't have to put a jacket on for us, likely. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1385.0s)]
*  I appreciate that you did, though. You look great. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1390.0s)]
*  I don't want to belabor the failure questions. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1393.0s)]
*  But and we'll turn it towards winning here shortly. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1399.0s)]
*  But a couple more on this, like at Aveo, I mean, you could have you could have folded, you could have folded, you could have you could have even gone down with that ship and then and then jumped on it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1403.0s)]
*  Plenty of plenty of biotech CEOs do it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1414.0s)]
*  You know, a company goes down, they they see it to the end and they pop up on another one. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1416.0s)]
*  You didn't in this case, you know, you fought for what you thought you should fight for, ended up winning that battle. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1421.0s)]
*  But when it is time to fold, how do you know? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1428.0s)]
*  You know, like, you know, you got to know when to fold them, you got to know when to fold them. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1431.0s)]
*  Yeah, what goes into what goes into your calculus when when it's when it's time to fold? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1435.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's a simple answer. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1441.0s)]
*  I know I have a tendency. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1444.0s)]
*  No, but it's funny because I'm actually exploring this in a book I'm reading. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1447.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've come across quit the power of knowing when to walk away by any dukes. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1452.0s)]
*  It's an interesting exploration of how we decide to persevere or when to quit or any dukes actually was a professional poker player. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1459.0s)]
*  So, you know, she uses the term when to know when to fold them as as you've referred to the Kenny Rogers analogy of play. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1469.0s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1476.0s)]
*  And you know, here's the other thing she explores. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1478.0s)]
*  And I think it's really interesting. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1480.0s)]
*  I would encourage anybody to read it. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1481.0s)]
*  And it would make my my executive assistant really nervous when I ordered the book, because she's like, are you quitting? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1483.0s)]
*  I said, no, I'm just trying to understand when it's the right time to quit. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1489.0s)]
*  And I'm not talking about your job, but you can give up on a project or move on to the next thing. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1494.0s)]
*  And I think that's the genesis of your question. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1499.0s)]
*  But, you know, one of the challenges just in society, you know, quitting is looked down on. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1503.0s)]
*  You know, how many times your your coach, whatever your father, your mother in growing up, say, don't be a quitter. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1508.0s)]
*  Get back in there. Just keep going. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1516.0s)]
*  And she takes an interesting exploration into, you know, in life and in business, quitting can often be the right decision, the best decision. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1518.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'll just make it concrete for you. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1529.0s)]
*  The two couple examples that stuck with me from her book was Muhammad Ali decided to continue to keep fighting and trying to get regain the title. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1532.0s)]
*  Another is, you know, the the folks who have summited or has quested to summit Everest and decided not to turn around just to keep going, even though, you know, maybe the bad weather is coming in. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1542.0s)]
*  And ultimately, it costs them their lives. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1556.0s)]
*  So there is a good time to quit and a bad time to quit. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1559.0s)]
*  You know, in my personal experiences, I've been incredibly fortunate that, you know, in taking a step back, reflecting on the situation, being very candid and objective. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1564.0s)]
*  And part of that, as I think I mentioned earlier, it's acknowledging your mistakes. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1577.0s)]
*  You know, what's one of the hardest things I think people have is that I made a mistake. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1582.0s)]
*  And that's why we're in this situation. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1587.0s)]
*  But I can we can fix that mistake. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1590.0s)]
*  We can take another course to overcome it versus just saying, I'm going to shove this aside and hide it in the closet because I don't want to acknowledge a failure. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1593.0s)]
*  So I think the key thing is really being objective. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1603.0s)]
*  I think it's understanding the complete situation. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1606.0s)]
*  You got to do your homework. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1610.0s)]
*  I mean, I spent a tremendous amount of time reading clinical studies. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1612.0s)]
*  I'm not a scientist, but I you know, there's a tremendous amount of value. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1615.0s)]
*  I take a lot of time reading books about kind of competition and how to ultimately be successful in a variety of arenas. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1620.0s)]
*  And that probably most importantly is I talk to a lot of smart people and I listen to those smart people and get their perspectives. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1631.0s)]
*  And it's not just the winners. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1638.0s)]
*  You go out and say, I'm going to go find that winner, the guy who, you know, has never missed on a swing. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1640.0s)]
*  But those are not necessarily people that you're going to learn from that are going to benefit you when you're faced with the challenges. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1647.0s)]
*  It's, you know, look the failures in the face and learn from them. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1654.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1658.0s)]
*  When we talk about failure in biotech and biopharma in general, I think there's a general, I guess, proclivity is to talk about clinical failure. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1659.0s)]
*  But in recent years, we've seen some multibillion dollar post-commercial failures, right? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1670.0s)]
*  Like multibillions of dollars in sales projections and the product just fizzles after it's been approved. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1677.0s)]
*  After that, you know, that that quote unquote finish line has been realized. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1683.0s)]
*  You've had experience with multiple commercial successes. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1689.0s)]
*  So I guess the question I want to get at there is like post-commercial failure. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1695.0s)]
*  And, you know, there are case studies upon case studies written about what went wrong, you know, when everything was going right, what went wrong once the commercial finish line was achieved. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1701.0s)]
*  In your experience, what are what are some of the factors that go into the post-commercial winner loss, you know, conquering a market versus falling apart after billions of dollars were invested in billions of dollars in sales were projected? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1712.0s)]
*  And how do you obviate? How do you obviate for a post-commercial, you know, a post-approval meltdown? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1727.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, let me just start by saying commercial launches are incredibly complex. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1734.0s)]
*  And I think you have to have an appreciation for the challenges and the complexity of that. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1740.0s)]
*  You know, I'll go back to my impound days. I remember first presenting my strategic plan to, you know, basically the board, which is largely scientific folks. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1747.0s)]
*  And, you know, I think the feeling was, oh, this is a great drug. It's going to sell itself. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1757.0s)]
*  And, you know, we talk about issues and, you know, reimbursement, you know, awareness, education, just to name a few kind of common issues that you have to overcome. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1763.0s)]
*  And I remember having to change the way I presented the issues, you know, and I started everything. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1774.0s)]
*  The drug will sell itself if it get if the physicians and patients get reimbursed. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1780.0s)]
*  The drug will sell itself if the physicians are fully aware of the data. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1785.0s)]
*  The drug will sell itself if we are positioned distinctly from our competition. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1789.0s)]
*  And it was just that nuance. And it's true. I mean, if you've got a good drug, people are aware of it. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1794.0s)]
*  They can get access to it. It's, you know, people and providing an advantage. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1800.0s)]
*  I think there's a certain momentum that goes along with that. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1805.0s)]
*  But all those other things you can't take for granted. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1808.0s)]
*  And one of the things again, it goes back to, you know, know the data, know the risks, know the science. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1812.0s)]
*  And it's, you know, as a commercial person, one of the things we pride our group on is that we know the data cold and, you know, not just our data, but we know the competition's data. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1819.0s)]
*  And that's critical to be able to find those little opportunities to distinguish yourself and then ultimately match that up with a patient population that can benefit the most from it. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1830.0s)]
*  And, you know, that that to me is how you sell. It's it's utilizing evidence based medicine, utilizing the data, utilizing the science. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1840.0s)]
*  But the other important thing that I think people don't consider enough is just the changing clinical scientific landscape. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1850.0s)]
*  You need to be looking 10 years down the road because if you need to take a turn or make a shift or an adjustment in your development program, it's going to take you three to five years to be able to do that. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1861.0s)]
*  It's like turning a battleship. You can't just, you know, tomorrow say, OK, now this is our new position. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1874.0s)]
*  It just doesn't work. You have to, you know, I firmly believe you have to support that with the evidence based medicine. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1881.0s)]
*  So, you know, again, being a student of the markets, being a student of the science again goes back to talk to people who are creating the future and understand where it's going to go and anticipate. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1888.0s)]
*  So many of the failures that you see in the marketplace are just some, you know, are situations in many cases that they just didn't anticipate that the world was going to change. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1902.0s)]
*  You know, it goes back to the Xerox kind of story. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1915.0s)]
*  I know not to, but just to make it concrete that, you know, they didn't anticipate the change in the world. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1919.0s)]
*  And, you know, that applies for pharmaceutical biotech marketing, too. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1926.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. We tend to use the word you're talking about turning around a battleship. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1931.0s)]
*  It's convenient to use the word pivot, but there's really no pivot. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1936.0s)]
*  Like pivot implies we're going to make an about face and instantly be moving in a different direction. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1941.0s)]
*  That doesn't work that way. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1946.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things I mean, we're doing combination studies. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1948.0s)]
*  And so, you know, part of that turning that battleship has to do with, you know, engaging with the rest of the oncology community. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1953.0s)]
*  No company has all the products that could be combined in the future to define the new standard of care. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1963.0s)]
*  So one of the key elements of, I think, success is to actively be out there looking for collaborations with the other companies who have innovative science. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1970.0s)]
*  Yeah. All right. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1984.0s)]
*  All right. One last one last question about about losing. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1986.0s)]
*  And then we'll talk about winning. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1989.0s)]
*  We'll get you know, turn it into a happier conversation. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1991.0s)]
*  When you when you do have to fold when you do have to lose. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1994.0s)]
*  What's what's your best advice on doing that smartly? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=1997.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, there's there's a right way to do it in the wrong way. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2001.0s)]
*  There's probably a whole lot of in between. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2005.0s)]
*  But what's your advice? Yeah, no, you know, three things come to kind of come to mind. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2007.0s)]
*  And I think about, you know, losing smartly. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2011.0s)]
*  First one is fail fast. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2015.0s)]
*  Time is money. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2018.0s)]
*  One of my favorite bands, Rush, Gettys, Lee said, if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2020.0s)]
*  And, you know, I've seen a lot of companies kind of get into an Alice paralysis or just afraid to, again, kill a program that they kind of start to acknowledge may not have a future. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2026.0s)]
*  And the longer it takes to make that decision, the more it costs and not just financially, but from a distraction for the company. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2040.0s)]
*  I mean, that that that is an important thing. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2048.0s)]
*  The second thing I'll say is do the right thing. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2052.0s)]
*  And again, if you want to fail smartly, act with integrity, because when you fail, it's always better if you did the right thing versus failing at trying to do something that you shouldn't. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2056.0s)]
*  And I'll just give you a very practical example of that. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2069.0s)]
*  Whenever we get to an impasse, and these are business impasses, what do we do in this situation? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2072.0s)]
*  And, you know, there's one what may cost more money when they take more time. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2079.0s)]
*  Well, I was asked my team to step back and ask the simple question again, this is going back to that mission focus. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2084.0s)]
*  What's in the best interest of the patients? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2091.0s)]
*  And it is remarkable how clarifying that statement or that question is in making these decisions. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2094.0s)]
*  Now, you know, it's not a guarantee that if you make the decision that's in the best interest of the patient, that it's going to come out the way you hoped it would. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2102.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you, as I said, I would much rather have made that decision and be able to sleep at night by saying we did the right thing. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2112.0s)]
*  We did it for the right reasons. That's really, I think, important. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2122.0s)]
*  And then the last thing, and this is kind of we just have a situation like this that I don't know how often this comes up. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2126.0s)]
*  But if you can design a win-win, then you win, you know, either way this thing goes. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2133.0s)]
*  And I'll give you the example of what I'm talking about. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2139.0s)]
*  And again, I don't know how often these come up. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2142.0s)]
*  I've seen it once or twice in my career where there's real opportunity to do this. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2145.0s)]
*  But for us, we took the Tavosinib and we wanted to move into the second line following I.O. combinations. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2149.0s)]
*  Right. So one of the big questions that was being asked in the scientific community is can you keep I.O. on board? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2156.0s)]
*  If you had prior I.O., would you is it OK to then treat again with I.O. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2164.0s)]
*  And in this case, in combination with a VEGF TKI, in our case, Tebo. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2169.0s)]
*  So we set out on a phase three study. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2174.0s)]
*  We call it Tenevo 2 study. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2177.0s)]
*  And this study, the way we designed it was again, the question was adding a PD-1 to a TKI. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2180.0s)]
*  Does that actually add additional value? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2187.0s)]
*  So the study design we did is we put our drug in both arms. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2191.0s)]
*  So it's Fetivda versus Fetivda plus Nivolumab, which is BMS's drug. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2195.0s)]
*  We did a clinical collaboration following a PD-1 combination. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2201.0s)]
*  So, you know, one of the questions is, does Nevo add anything on top of Tebo? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2205.0s)]
*  But the other side of that win is we get a great data set, evidence based medicine that we've been looking for as a single agent [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2211.0s)]
*  following I.O. combinations, which is the new standard of care in first line. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2221.0s)]
*  So you design a win-win. One could say if the study doesn't work out, you say that it failed. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2225.0s)]
*  But you failed very smartly because you had the results from the control arm. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2230.0s)]
*  So that one, like I said, I don't know if that's out there all the time for everybody to take advantage of. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2235.0s)]
*  But, you know, be creative and try to think out of the box. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2242.0s)]
*  Thinking of win-wins is a lovely place to be. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2246.0s)]
*  Yeah. Engineer yourself into it. Design yourself into a win, in other words. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2250.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2256.0s)]
*  Yeah. Very cool. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2257.0s)]
*  Yeah. Now, we'll turn the tide here and talk about winning. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2259.0s)]
*  We just talked about commercial failures and some of the things that caused them. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2263.0s)]
*  The last time you and I had a chance to catch up, I remember you telling me that you do not like to follow the quote unquote commercial playbook. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2269.0s)]
*  You know, like if you went to Bill Belichick and you said, you know, you don't need that. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2278.0s)]
*  You don't need that playbook. You know, throw that out the window. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2282.0s)]
*  Let's just play football. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2284.0s)]
*  You know, he'd look at you like he had three heads. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2285.0s)]
*  So I'm going to give you the opportunity to explain what you mean by that. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2288.0s)]
*  Sure. So just to familiarize listeners, commercial playbook is literally you can buy them from consulting groups and they're about four inches thick. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2291.0s)]
*  And they have every single thing you're supposed to do when you launch a book. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2300.0s)]
*  It's very prescribed when you launch a drug. It's very prescribed. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2303.0s)]
*  I believe personally that the commercial playbook has become a bit bloated. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2307.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's almost the 80-20. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2312.0s)]
*  You know, you're going to have certain things that are going to give you huge return on investment or huge bang for the buck. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2315.0s)]
*  And then it's going to just continue to get diminishing returns as you continue to spend money. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2321.0s)]
*  And I honestly think one of the things at least what we've kind of tried to embrace in a small biotech is let's be as efficient with our spend. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2326.0s)]
*  So, again, just spending towards the whole commercial playbook, probably not going to be able to afford it. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2337.0s)]
*  And you're going to certainly waste quite a bit of money. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2343.0s)]
*  And I think that's one of the challenges that some of the pharma companies have is that they end up spending because that's the way we've always done it. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2345.0s)]
*  I firmly believe that every situation is unique. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2354.0s)]
*  And as such, launch situation as such, it requires a tailored approach. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2358.0s)]
*  You know, perfect example, going back to Fatimta and COVID. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2363.0s)]
*  I mean, throw the playbook out the window. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2367.0s)]
*  How do you launch a product when you can't actually get in contact in person with your customers? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2370.0s)]
*  And that's been the model for, you know, 100 years. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2378.0s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, there's no personal contact with your customer. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2382.0s)]
*  What do you do that? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2387.0s)]
*  Well, you know, look, we had already had this kind of mindset that every situation is unique. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2389.0s)]
*  So as we were faced with that, we found it kind of second nature to say, let's build a tailored plan to launch in COVID. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2394.0s)]
*  And I think that served as well as evidence by the recognition we got as one of the best launches of the year. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2403.0s)]
*  So, you know, that's what I mean by don't, you know, the playbook is not something that you want to rely on. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2411.0s)]
*  But now let me just say this. I don't want to completely dismiss the value of a launch playbook because I will tell you personally, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2419.0s)]
*  and I expect this of my teams, is to look through the playbook and make sure you're not missing something. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2425.0s)]
*  To me, the value of the playbook is, again, I mentioned it's incredibly complex launching in pharmaceutical in the US in particular. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2432.0s)]
*  And if you miss a critical item, you will pay for that down the road. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2443.0s)]
*  So the playbook is not the here's all we're going to do, but let's make sure we're doing the stuff we're supposed to do. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2448.0s)]
*  That's the way I look at it. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2455.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. In keeping with my probably bad football analogy, I dropped Bill Belichick's name. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2456.0s)]
*  I don't even know what he's doing these days, right? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2464.0s)]
*  But in keeping with that analogy nonetheless, can you give any other examples of times where you and your team have called audibles to adjust, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2467.0s)]
*  to make an adjustment in the face of adversity like the COVID example you gave? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2480.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the COVID is just such a wealth of experience and I feel very privileged to have gone through it and then more privileged to have been successful. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2484.0s)]
*  But it's probably one of the biggest high stakes audibles you could call because, gosh, we were deciding whether we were going to launch this product ourselves. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2497.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, that was an important decision and it certainly would have been easier just to hand it off to a big pharma company. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2508.0s)]
*  But, you know, we were committed to building a world class oncology organization in order to do that. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2515.0s)]
*  You get to launch products. But I'll just give you some examples. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2521.0s)]
*  So we were starting to build the sales force around that the time when COVID started to set in. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2525.0s)]
*  We sat down and we said, OK, you're not going to be able to access your customers in person. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2532.0s)]
*  So you can't just have salespeople that have a successful track record, but rather you also have to have people that have relationships because, you know, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2537.0s)]
*  recognizing you're going to have to make a phone call, do an email, and you don't know that person, you're not picking up the phone call, you're not answering the email. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2548.0s)]
*  So you have to have these relationships. And so, you know, we're going into launch. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2558.0s)]
*  We don't have tons of money, but we said this is worth spending the money. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2562.0s)]
*  So, you know, we had to pay a premium to get those people. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2567.0s)]
*  But we felt it was that important to make sure that we had not only, you know, the top performing salespeople, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2570.0s)]
*  but also people with those kind of relationships that can open the door. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2579.0s)]
*  And it was very successful. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2584.0s)]
*  The other thing was, you know, everybody's done non-personal promotion. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2586.0s)]
*  You do speakers programs, you do these kind of things. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2591.0s)]
*  But this was a whole other dimension. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2593.0s)]
*  What do we do now that, you know, we've got to compete for this kind of non-personal promotion that's, quote unquote, omni-channel type access to our customers. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2596.0s)]
*  So, you know, we worked very quickly and lock up key channels on that, recognizing that this is going to be more competitive. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2607.0s)]
*  The further we go into this pandemic, and we were very successful in doing that. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2615.0s)]
*  And I think we got our message across to our customers, which ended up helping them make the right decisions for their patients. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2621.0s)]
*  Now, I will tell you, this doesn't stop after COVID. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2628.0s)]
*  If you truly believe what I believe, which is this idea that every situation is a, you know, is a unique situation that requires a tailored solution, then you got to continue this. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2634.0s)]
*  It's kind of a, we're hardwired to say what's the next thing. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2647.0s)]
*  So stay tuned. AI is going to be incredibly cool. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2652.0s)]
*  As we get into commercialization, we're already using some AI techniques and, you know, artificial intelligence is one of the core competencies of our parent company, LG. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2657.0s)]
*  They have the ABCs, artificial intelligence, biotech, and then clean energy. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2668.0s)]
*  So we straighten their sweet spot. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2674.0s)]
*  And I think that gives us, again, an advantage over some of our contemporaries in the industry. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2676.0s)]
*  Hmm. That's, well, you just cracked open a can of worms that we don't have time to dig into. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2683.0s)]
*  I mean, the AI angle, specifically your mention of AI in the context of, you know, pre and commercial activity. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2689.0s)]
*  I mean, that's super interesting to me. Can you give us, and I don't want to put you in a position. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2699.0s)]
*  No, I'll give you a great example. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2702.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2704.0s)]
*  We can, through the big database, you know, claims databases, you can watch, quote unquote, watch, you know, the systems can allow you to understand what, you know, based on certain activities and prescriptions, supportive care, you know, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2705.0s)]
*  And so, you know, if you have a huge amount of data, you can identify when a patient is going to progress and then need a next line of therapy. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2728.0s)]
*  We can send a, we can send a kind of a flag to our salespeople and say, Dr. Smith has a second line patient, kidney cancer patient, who's received X, Y, Z before and is likely to progress based on this artificial intelligence algorithm. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2736.0s)]
*  It's not perfect, but it's cool. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2758.0s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, not perfect, but data that's more readily available thanks to the tool than it otherwise would have been. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2761.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we're getting a pretty good success rate on that. And, you know, look, that's the, it's like going fishing often, you know, if you don't have that kind of sonar to be able to see that there's actually fish around, you can sit and fish in a place that there's no fish for a really long time. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2770.0s)]
*  So we're sending our people to fish in a place where, you know, we can see that there's a need for what they're bringing to the table. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2789.0s)]
*  Well, you got to, yeah, now I'm going to tag on to your fishing analogy real quick. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2799.0s)]
*  You got to trust the technology though, because you bring that up and it makes me recollect the story. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2804.0s)]
*  I used to spend a lot of time fishing with an old timer who, when we started using, you know, fish finders, he would scoff at them and say, those things are programmed at the factory. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2810.0s)]
*  You know, they're showing you fish that programmed at the factory. But it's an important point because you do, there are a lot of folks out there in our space who don't necessarily trust the technology. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2821.0s)]
*  You've got to know where the data is coming from and trust that it's doing its job. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2830.0s)]
*  And look, you got to be willing to be a pioneer. That's it. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2833.0s)]
*  I mean, it's, you know, it's not going to work all the time. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2837.0s)]
*  And there's, you know, there's definitely a learning that goes along with the artificial intelligence. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2840.0s)]
*  So, you know, we keep feeding back information that they keep spitting it out. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2847.0s)]
*  And, you know, hopefully we get to a point where we can really be in a place to, again, provide solutions to patients when they most need it. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2852.0s)]
*  Yeah, very good. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2860.0s)]
*  Very good. We are, we're running short on time. Michael, I feel like I could talk to you all afternoon. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2861.0s)]
*  So I'm going to ask you a few more questions and wrap things up here. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2866.0s)]
*  I want to make sure I give you an opportunity to tell us what's coming down the pipeline there at Aveil. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2870.0s)]
*  So tell us about what's in the pipeline, like what's coming down the pike here and how you're, I guess, maybe share some strategy around how you're navigating them towards more Ws in the W column. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2876.0s)]
*  Yeah, so just kind of recap that the Tenevo 2 study, we hope to be presenting the results of that. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2889.0s)]
*  Again, a phase three study with Tvozinib in combination with Novolymab versus Tvozinib in kidney cancer following prior IO systemic therapy. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2895.0s)]
*  So that's hopefully going to be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2906.0s)]
*  I mentioned a little bit about the importance of the LG collaboration and the support that they've given us to allow us to move forward with our second most advanced program, which is Ficlatuzumab, which is a HDFC med inhibitor. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2912.0s)]
*  We're studying that in combination with my old friend, Erbitux in head and neck cancer. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2930.0s)]
*  So I'm probably one of the oldest commercial people in head and neck cancer. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2934.0s)]
*  I've been about 20 years, but we're really excited. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2939.0s)]
*  An incredible amount of unmet need. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2942.0s)]
*  These patients are in dire need of effective therapies. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2944.0s)]
*  So we're running a phase three study in HPV negative patients, which is a poor prognosis subset of the overall head and neck population. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2948.0s)]
*  And then behind that, we've got AV380. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2958.0s)]
*  This is our anti-GDF15 antibody, which we're studying that for cachexia, which is a muscle wasting that's associated often with cancer. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2962.0s)]
*  And, you know, if you think about Steve Jobs and, you know, near the end of his life, he had really lost a lot of weight. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2972.0s)]
*  He probably didn't die of his cancer. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2979.0s)]
*  He probably died of his cachexia. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2981.0s)]
*  There's no effective treatments. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2983.0s)]
*  So this is a kind of first in class antibody that was developed internally. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2985.0s)]
*  We're really excited to be moving that forward to try to tackle that significant unmet need. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2991.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, good luck on those programs. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=2997.0s)]
*  Great, great progress. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3000.0s)]
*  And I'm kind of bookending this with with stuff that I normally do up front. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3003.0s)]
*  You know, these episodes usually sort of follow an arc of like, let's get to know Michael and let's get to know what excites him and what makes him tick. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3007.0s)]
*  And then let's learn his pipeline. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3016.0s)]
*  I'm going to ask you this question here towards the end, because whenever I look at my guests, you know, educational backgrounds and career trajectories, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3017.0s)]
*  I always pick out questions where I see interesting inflection points or where questions or gaps remain. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3026.0s)]
*  And when I look at yours, like going way back to to your undergrad, psychology and economics and then an MBA in international marketing, which, you know, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3033.0s)]
*  I mean, the biotech leaders that I've interviewed come from every walk of life you can imagine. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3043.0s)]
*  But this one in particular doesn't scream, you know, this guy's destined for a career in biofarm and leading biotechs. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3049.0s)]
*  So so I just got to hear at least a short version of the story that got you into biotech in biofarm, as it were, in the first place. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3056.0s)]
*  First of all, I'll acknowledge I'm definitely a unique individual. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3066.0s)]
*  I get told that all the time. So I'm not exactly your your typical CEO pedigree or or, you know, et cetera. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3070.0s)]
*  But look, it is interesting. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3079.0s)]
*  And unlike my kids now who seem to be laser focused on what they want to do in their lives, I did a little more meandering in my my career choice. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3082.0s)]
*  In fact, my father was a lifetime research scientist, so I've been exposed to the pharmaceutical industry through my entire upbringing. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3093.0s)]
*  And he was always very proud of what he had accomplished when he'd come home. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3101.0s)]
*  And that was exciting for me to see that I so I started to have a love for science. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3106.0s)]
*  And I actually started my career in my college career wanting to be a doctor. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3111.0s)]
*  That's how I set it out. But, you know, this was in the 80s. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3117.0s)]
*  And if you remember the culture in the 80s, you know, read is good. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3122.0s)]
*  The green of the 80s really kind of directed me towards finance and and Wall Street and that kind of stuff. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3127.0s)]
*  So I pursued that did that for a couple of years and frankly found that I was kind of missing felt like I was missing something. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3133.0s)]
*  I missed the science. I felt like I could do more to feel good about what I did every day. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3142.0s)]
*  You know, my example before I would have just had I can make money or this be good for my career. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3149.0s)]
*  I didn't really have that patient as the that that focus to keep you going when you had bad days. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3154.0s)]
*  So I went back to school really to follow my father's footsteps to go get my MBA and pursue a career in drug development. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3162.0s)]
*  But I, you know, recognize that drug development is not just science. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3172.0s)]
*  It's also the business. And so I felt like that I could I could bring that part of the equation to the table. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3177.0s)]
*  I was very fortunate to have an opportunity to work in London while getting my MBA and at Smith Klein Beach and as an intern. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3185.0s)]
*  And then was able to parlay that into a job at Smith Klein Beach. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3195.0s)]
*  I'm coming out and it was a very fortunate time. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3201.0s)]
*  Jericho Bellis had started this kind of innovative, if you will, very high profile management development program. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3204.0s)]
*  We had two people in each class. The other guy was Ron Square went on to run a race. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3214.0s)]
*  That company, Defizer, for eleven billion dollars. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3220.0s)]
*  But he and I went through this program, spent about five years, and we got the opportunity, really privileged to be rotated around to a variety of different things. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3225.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, got right out of business school, launching the product I mentioned earlier, working on flagship products, getting an opportunity to go out in the field, working on managed markets. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3234.0s)]
*  It was all all very exciting. And, you know, I'm very fortunate to have had a mentor like Jericho Bellis to give me that opportunity. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3246.0s)]
*  And then the rest is just history. Yeah. Well, we're fortunate that that's the path that you went down. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3255.0s)]
*  I mean, you're doing great work, have done great work, continue to do great work. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3262.0s)]
*  And I appreciate you coming on the show. I'm going to ask you to wrap things up with some advice for the guy or gal who's in the shoes you were in back in the early 90s and maybe has some opportunity like you did to to pursue a path in biotech, but isn't sure which path to pursue or how to pursue it. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3266.0s)]
*  What advice would you offer? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3288.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's more common than than you think. And I think, you know, people come into the industry. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3289.0s)]
*  And one of the things, the beauty of being in a biotech is you get that exposure to a lot of different things. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3296.0s)]
*  And we've given the opportunity for people in our organization to come in in one role and then want to switch to another. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3302.0s)]
*  So that that I think is a great opportunity. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3308.0s)]
*  But the key thing here is get as much out of all those experiences you possibly can. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3311.0s)]
*  Said another way, don't take any shortcuts. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3318.0s)]
*  I see a lot of people who feel like they're they need to be progressing faster than they're progressing. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3322.0s)]
*  And, you know, I think you can miss out on some great experiences, bringing things to conclusion. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3327.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, doing some for six months and then saying, I checked that box is is very different from actually, you know, doing it for two years and, you know, having that complete experience. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3333.0s)]
*  But I think I shared with you the lifelong friend is now an executive coach, a guy named Gerald Mosley. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3344.0s)]
*  He put it he defined it as the five E's of life and career. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3352.0s)]
*  So I actually gave him the fifth one. This one teens are for excitement. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3356.0s)]
*  So it doesn't really have a lot to do here. Career. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3361.0s)]
*  But it has to do with having fun throughout your life. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3364.0s)]
*  20s are for education. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3367.0s)]
*  30s are for experience. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3370.0s)]
*  40s are for equity and 50s are for enjoyment. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3372.0s)]
*  And if you play your cards right, you can follow that continuum. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3375.0s)]
*  But again, I see lots of folks in their 30s saying, I have made, you know, millions of dollars. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3379.0s)]
*  I haven't had the big win. I haven't, you know, gotten a senior vice president title. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3385.0s)]
*  Just take your time, get the experiences, build a foundation, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3390.0s)]
*  and then you can stand on top of that foundation into your 50s and 60s and really enjoy it. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3395.0s)]
*  I personally am 58. I'm having the time of my life. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3401.0s)]
*  I'm really enjoying what we're doing. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3407.0s)]
*  And, you know, I think I can say that because I've had a lot of experiences. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3410.0s)]
*  I'm not afraid of failure. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3415.0s)]
*  You know, there's very few things and I'm knocking out wood right now. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3418.0s)]
*  There's very few things I haven't seen, but I'm sure there's more in store. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3421.0s)]
*  So stay tuned. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3424.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's fantastic. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3426.0s)]
*  Some of the most transparent, genuine and valuable insight. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3428.0s)]
*  I think that we've entertained on the business of biotech. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4egYLsK1JIE&t=3433.0s)]
