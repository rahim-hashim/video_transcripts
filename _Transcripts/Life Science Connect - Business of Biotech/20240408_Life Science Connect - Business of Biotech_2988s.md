Video Description: Ampersand Biomedicines CEO Jason Gardner, Ph.D. first took the leap from a global pharmaceutical giant to a startup at the forefront of transplant medicine innovation. Since that time, he's seen most of the ups and the downs that come with biotech leadership, and in his latest venture with the Flagship Pioneering-backed Ampersand, he's putting all those hard-fought lessons to good use. On this episode of the Business of Biotech -- the final (finally!) of several recorded at the JPM Healthcare Conference in January -- Gardner shares how and why he's applying his experience to the buildout of a precision medicine platform company, his thoughts on how big data and AI are influencing the precision medicine space and putting the "tech" in "techbio," his company's acquisition strategy, most recently demonstrated by Ampersand's acquisition of AbCheck, why "paranoid optimism" is central to his company's culture, and much, much more.

# Precision Drug Delivery with Ampersand Biomedicines' Jason Gardner, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU)
*  I'm Matt Piller, host of the Business of Biotech podcast, and if you're listening to my voice right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=0.0s)]
*  now but not seeing my face, maybe you haven't heard that we've launched a new Business of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=4.64s)]
*  Biotech video cast page under the Listen and Watch tab at bioprocessonline.com. There you'll [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  find hundreds of videos of my interviews with biotech builders, categorized by topic like [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=15.84s)]
*  finance and capital markets, regulatory, discovery, and manufacturing. Don't try it if you listen while [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=21.2s)]
*  driving, but be sure to check it out when you get where you're going. Go to bioprocessonline.com, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=28.0s)]
*  hit the Listen and Watch tab, and choose Business of Biotech in the drop down. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=33.12s)]
*  I'm not shy about my admiration for the flagship pioneering community. It's a veritable breeding [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=41.36s)]
*  ground for biotech innovation, and the organization has given us generous access to its partner CEOs, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=47.68s)]
*  itself a who's who of biotech entrepreneurship. Less than a year into his role as CEO at [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=54.16s)]
*  Ampersand Biomedicines, Jason Gardner offers a case in point. He joined Ampersand on the heels of his [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  leadership of the rise and ultimate wind down of magenta therapeutics, that tenure preceded by a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=68.24s)]
*  lengthy career that started at Chiron and saw a long stay at GSK. Jason's seen some things, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=74.8s)]
*  experienced the highs and the lows, and come back for more, demonstrating the kind of fortitude [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=82.16s)]
*  required of a leader in this tough business. At Ampersand, he's working on a tech-driven platform [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=87.2s)]
*  that aims to redefine how we identify local precision medicine targets and develop navigable [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  therapeutics to address those targets. I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business of Biotech, and I [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=100.32s)]
*  was honored to sit down with Jason in San Francisco to discuss this heady stuff and a whole lot more. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=105.84s)]
*  Let's give it a listen. Jason Gardner, CEO at Ampersand. Before we get into learning about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=111.68s)]
*  Ampersand, I want to rewind a little bit and get to know you. It's always interesting to me when [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=118.4s)]
*  an exec leaves the at least perceived comforts of a company like GSK, where you were for 11 years, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  to jump into sort of a biotechnique. You did that, notably, leading to the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=134.32s)]
*  genetotherapeutics after 11 years at GSK. The funnest question is, what motivated you to make that move? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  Yes. First of all, Matt, thanks for having me. No, my pleasure. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=147.92s)]
*  Reflecting back at that time and that decision, there were really three memories behind that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=153.12s)]
*  First, the science. The science of transplant medicine was really coming together with a number [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=159.84s)]
*  of academic labs and new programs coming out. It was a great opportunity to build a company around [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=167.68s)]
*  it. Second was the impact of the disease. Transplants are curative. Transplants are really [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=173.6s)]
*  not done as widely as they could be because it's quite hard for patients to go through it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=183.28s)]
*  Initially, it was about non-swap, but we gently built to solve with this new science. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=188.16s)]
*  And the third was the people. One of the people who was co-founded with me was my [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=193.04s)]
*  born postdoc, a Harvard-Denis Gatton. And then both Atlas and Third Rock ventures were interested [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=198.56s)]
*  in the science in building setter companies. And so we were able to bring them together [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=207.92s)]
*  and build one company. And that became Magenta. So that combination, and we'll talk a bit more [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=214.56s)]
*  about that, it's a future decision. The science, the impact on patients and the people, to me, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=220.88s)]
*  was very important. And so even though I wasn't looking to leave GST, that was the scream works [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=227.76s)]
*  of motivation. There's got to be, and I ask this question often, and sometimes I get on a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=233.44s)]
*  street. I don't. There's got to be at least some degree of trepidation when you make a move like [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  that. I mean, people spend their entire careers at companies like GSK comfortably, especially in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=247.6s)]
*  leadership positions like you are in. It wasn't like there was the end of a career trajectory [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=252.88s)]
*  there. So walk me through that. Speaking to folks who may be considering making such a move, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=258.32s)]
*  how do you rationalize it? And how do your wife take it, Jason? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  So I'd been in biotech before GSK. I spent eight years first here at the Chiron as a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=271.2s)]
*  genius scientist and then at Bridges House in New York as a most senior scientist. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=278.56s)]
*  So I knew a bit about biotech and life in a smaller company. And again, I'd be very happy [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  and I had great opportunities at GSK. But this was the moment for me to really look at [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  those three principles, the science, the impact on patients and the team. And I just felt [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  doing that in a new company startup environment would be impactful and also a challenge to me [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  personally in the next chapter of my career. So that dinner table conversation with my wife was [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=307.28s)]
*  very interesting and I got very clear feedback that if this was the moment, this is what I should [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=316.56s)]
*  do. Yeah, so yeah, the support is fundamental. And you're incredibly, can I just double click [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  on that? So when I was building Magenta and then similarly now at AppDocent, I talk about that with [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=332.16s)]
*  our employees, our employees, families and their friends and their networks are really parts of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=338.24s)]
*  our extended team. And we rely on them sometimes. When the days are long and there are ups and downs [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=344.48s)]
*  and twists and turns in our industry and our work, it's often our families and our friends [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=351.68s)]
*  should provide that support. So I always thank our team members to ensure and ensure the big [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=356.56s)]
*  pass on that thanks to that team, that extended team. That's very important. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=362.08s)]
*  Yeah. Another transition that I wanted to get your perspective on would be, I mean, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=366.16s)]
*  you mentioned that you started out as a research scientist. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=372.48s)]
*  At what point along the road did you begin to develop an interest in leadership and business [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=378.0s)]
*  development? Yeah, so basically I went into biotech and into the industry principally because I [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  loved science, but I really wanted to make medicines. And then I just thought that was the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=393.36s)]
*  best way to do that. And so learning the science of the industry, which is really the foundation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=397.84s)]
*  of our industry was terrific. I worked on programs that became medicines. So I'm very [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=404.56s)]
*  fortunate in that I worked with great teams. And then naturally I was fortunate to get leadership [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=410.56s)]
*  opportunities, leading projects first and then leading teams and then building teams and then [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=415.28s)]
*  building units over the years. And then the business side just came along the side, setting [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  up budgets, setting up partnerships, knowing how to do that, learning, adapting and thinking [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=426.0s)]
*  strategically. And then I learned a lot of the business from people who I worked with from by [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=432.56s)]
*  doing and delivering. And I think that's a very important way to learn a lot in school and a lot [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=438.24s)]
*  both on the science and the business side, but doing that to practice and doing that with great [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=445.2s)]
*  people. You can learn from being humble, being humble and also knowing that everything we do [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=450.16s)]
*  here in the industry is as a team and being able to communicate well and listen and learn fast. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=455.76000000000005s)]
*  It's been, I think I've been very lucky to have those opportunities and I'm not exactly [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=463.44000000000005s)]
*  all doing that. I'm just not. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Was there a particular point where, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, as you assume those responsibilities, those leadership responsibilities, was there a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=475.52s)]
*  particular point where, well, was it, you know, a light bulb moment? Like I want to run the show. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=480.96s)]
*  Yeah. So that's an interesting question. I believe in, you know, my values will mainly be around [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=487.52s)]
*  in acting patients and if I was using science to do that in a leadership role, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=498.88s)]
*  that is in battle and then to me, but if I could make more of that. And then I woke up one day and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=503.52s)]
*  thought, it has to be a CEO. I want to be a CEO. It was more of a natural progression. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=510.64s)]
*  I was also very fortunate to have a number of influential mentors and still do it in my career. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=518.8s)]
*  Both at GSK, both beyond GSK and until today in the venture world and in the biotech world. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=527.28s)]
*  And I think, I believe firmly that those types of experienced mentors, those folks who have been [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=534.0s)]
*  CEOs or being leaders, provide a huge amount of feedback into our system. Even though that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=540.4s)]
*  has those operational roles. Yeah. That's incredibly important. You look at the diaspora, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=547.52s)]
*  certainly in the Boston biotech community of companies that have become great companies [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  and team members who have gone on to do great things in other companies and then beyond. It's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  an amazing network. Yeah. And it's one of the reasons I believe the venture firms and the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=564.8s)]
*  investors like flagship have, you know, town-based the networks to be able to access and tap into [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=571.68s)]
*  that. And so as a CEO, I remember one of my mentors, right? This took the role of [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=578.72s)]
*  what we created in Fairfax and Magenta told me the CEO is the loneliest job in the world. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=588.0s)]
*  And it is the time where you find out how you can actually make hard decisions, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=593.84s)]
*  but it doesn't need to be. You often experience bored, a team around you, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=600.32s)]
*  those networks can be very helpful. Yeah. Did you take advantage of any formalized [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=606.0s)]
*  network opportunities? Or was it more of an informal? Oh, no, it's more informal. And I [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=612.4s)]
*  would say, you know, I think folks have been very generous with that sign, which we're the other [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=620.88s)]
*  years. And I also like some sort of network where people as well share experiences. And in today's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=625.36s)]
*  flagship world as well, there is a very vibrant cross CEO and cross company and within the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=631.9200000000001s)]
*  flagship, right? Start ecosystem, right? A lot of sharing of experiences and ideas as well. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=638.88s)]
*  It's a great model. What's all more about is company creation. It's also a great model of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=649.28s)]
*  network for company building and company execution as well that interplay. Sure. It's [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  those experiences. So I think networking and the networking skills, and I tell my [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=660.0s)]
*  children who are teenagers about that and what you learn in college is going to be important. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=664.16s)]
*  What you then do with that is going to be important in your careers. But true, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  and how you work and building those networks over the years has gone to be important for whatever [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=672.4799999999999s)]
*  career choice you've made, particularly in the empire. Entirely. I mean, I could go long on [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  stories about this. My son just started college this past fall, and he's of this mindset where [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=684.24s)]
*  he just thinks he has to have everything mapped out. And I'm like, but you can map it out all you [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=690.96s)]
*  want. It's not going to play out the way you, but it's who, what, and how, right? You interact. So [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=695.2s)]
*  I want to get the story behind your arrival on the scene at flagship. So you're only six or so [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=702.96s)]
*  months on the scene right now? Five. Five. Okay. So not even six yet. Yeah. So new there, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=710.24s)]
*  you joined flagship sort of on the heels of magenta, wind down. That would be the appropriate [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=716.8s)]
*  way to put it. So how did that come to pass? Yeah. So basically I was thinking about my next role [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=722.4s)]
*  and the way I could impact patients and science and really very much serious about an organization. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=729.84s)]
*  So I got to know the flagship team. We had several members there already to pull beyond the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=737.28s)]
*  medical teams, the repurposed teams, and we started a conversation about, you know, what [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=744.0s)]
*  could be an international opportunity. So we had to dive in on it. Then I got to know [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=753.04s)]
*  back and the ampersand team. And I went on the CDA. I'd read the website and I listened to a [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=759.84s)]
*  lot of flagship interviews on YouTube as well. So it really got to understand what it's like to work [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=770.64s)]
*  with the goody diligence as folks speak. But I went on the CDA and I went and saw the ampersand [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  data, the science, and I was blown away. So I thought this is what I have to do next. I'm [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=786.24s)]
*  going to talk a bit about what the company's doing on the platform. But I really wanted to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=791.52s)]
*  build a platform company, just the business option I see. I think the opportunities and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=796.48s)]
*  partnerships we're talking about that in this current capital markets. It's very powerful. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=802.4s)]
*  I like the impact of this platform on patients, the flagship, and then the team. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=810.24s)]
*  So the team was Trichard and the flagship Loggle and the expertise the flagship raised. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=816.24s)]
*  So it checked those three boxes for me. And so it was a very, in the end, straightforward decision. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=821.04s)]
*  I'm about to say the dinner table conversation this time. I have it on my wife. It was very [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=828.24s)]
*  straightforward. Yeah, very nice. Yeah, ampersand formed up officially in 21. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=834.0s)]
*  Yes. So obviously, as before your arrival on the scene, but give me a little bit of the backstory [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=841.04s)]
*  into how and why. Yeah. So this is really, I think, very important about the flagship model. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=849.04s)]
*  So the science comes from flagship explorations into emerging areas of [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=856.64s)]
*  big breaking science. So three years ago, he went a lot back, which really went big biology, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=863.84s)]
*  big data, AI was starting to emerge on to the biotech scene. So flagship creates companies around [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=871.28s)]
*  audacious questions, questions that other investors would look at and ask why we've [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=880.32s)]
*  asked that question. Right. Right. So that can be incredibly powerful [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=888.56s)]
*  thinking about what could happen next. And the question for ampersand basically was, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=897.68s)]
*  what if we could program smarter medicines to act and work only where they're needed in the body? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=902.4s)]
*  So this is a question that has challenged the industry since the start. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=911.92s)]
*  We make many medicines that work and we give them to patients. The vast majority of them [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=918.64s)]
*  do not specifically target exactly where they need to be. So I'll give you an example. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  Steroids. Steroids widely is a neutral information. Steroids work across lots of tissues, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  it causes lots of side effects and we wish we could just target them specifically to where they're [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=939.5999999999999s)]
*  needed. So there's lots of other types of medicines that could also apply that to them. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=943.68s)]
*  So with that question, how do you do that? Well, with big data and AI starting to emerge three [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=949.04s)]
*  years ago, basically they built a country around this challenge of creating an addressed map, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=955.5999999999999s)]
*  molecular anatomy of the human body, tissue, cellular and protein level, you know, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=962.2399999999999s)]
*  understanding all the potential targets that you could then use to send medicines exactly [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=969.8399999999999s)]
*  to where they're needed. It programmed biologics. So basically, take the midrash and say it's in the [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=976.9599999999999s)]
*  kidney and then make an antibody just to bind to that address and then attach the antibody to [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=984.0799999999999s)]
*  an active drug that you then send to the kidney and it only works in the kidney. Now you already [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=991.52s)]
*  know the drug's active, maybe an approved drug, right? But it could be a drug that's already been [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=997.28s)]
*  done something but didn't work out because it didn't have the right pulmonary levels or it had [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1001.76s)]
*  safety effects. But you can then apply this address map, proxperited different tissues and diseases [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1005.6s)]
*  as a platform. So that was three years ago in the first year, starting to assemble all these [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1013.12s)]
*  publicly available data sets, start learning algorithms to protect the targets and then over [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1019.12s)]
*  the next two years developed even bigger data sets, both public as well as proprietary data sets [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1024.96s)]
*  over there in the flagship ecosystem and then started to generate data because the algorithms [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1032.24s)]
*  and the machine learning can actually design the molecules on the computer. So you can then test [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1038.48s)]
*  the one on the computer in the machine learning and then you can test a handful in the lab [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1045.2s)]
*  and you can do that within months, which would normally take years and frankly would still have [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  high risk whether the biology would work. And I'll just take a step back. Today, at the start of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1059.12s)]
*  clinical development, 90% of the drugs start clinical development. So imagine if you're a [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1067.12s)]
*  sports player, you're a 90% or 10% batting average of the baseball player, it just wouldn't work. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1076.5600000000002s)]
*  So one of the reasons that that number is so high at the federal level is because our ability to [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1084.5600000000002s)]
*  select the targets and send drugs to the right places, the bio-distribution of our citizens [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1090.3200000000002s)]
*  has never been possible to make it precise to program without this type of platform. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1094.64s)]
*  So that was the foundational science in this platform, the address map, machine learning, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1101.6000000000001s)]
*  the algorithms, the ability to get started with drugs within months, not years. And then I started [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1109.44s)]
*  to look at the data and the early progress and talk about some of them. It was really exciting. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1114.48s)]
*  And so I knew this would be a big story. Yeah, the vision and the vision that you could actually show [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1121.2800000000002s)]
*  and understand that it was working very quickly, even in critical hypostatics. And then the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1127.04s)]
*  opportunities across all sets of diseases, the opportunities for partnerships, and I think the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1132.0s)]
*  opportunities to make a massive impact that would not have been possible before. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1137.28s)]
*  Yeah. When you started talking about sort of the idea and you said the investment community, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1141.44s)]
*  the traditional investment community might look at that wide-eyed, right? Raise an eyebrow, perhaps. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1150.0s)]
*  Black Ship Strikes Me is interesting in its commitment to the exploratory. I don't know, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1156.64s)]
*  there's probably a more eloquent way of saying that, but it's unique. And I wonder how [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1163.6s)]
*  it's rationalized. What's your perception on that? How do you rationalize funding, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1167.92s)]
*  especially in this economy when there are so many VCs or tranching deals based on outcomes, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1176.48s)]
*  specific milestones, and if it doesn't happen, it's over. You're talking about putting [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1186.4s)]
*  significant resources behind big concepts. I'm just curious how would you rationalize that? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1192.5600000000002s)]
*  So it's a great question. And from my perspective, it really is best answered [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1199.8400000000001s)]
*  through the lens of the platform. Do you really believe you have a platform and you're building [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1207.92s)]
*  a platform company? Or are you really interested in building an asset in a company with one or [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1212.24s)]
*  two assets? So in order to have a platform, I believe as a business, you'd have to set out [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1218.72s)]
*  milestones to demonstrate that you have a platform. So what does it take to build a platform? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1227.68s)]
*  And this was interesting as I got to Netflix here and got on the CDA. And I remember visiting [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1232.8s)]
*  Ampsand and talking to some of the scientists. It was really great, very exciting. And that night, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1238.1599999999999s)]
*  one of the flagship recruitments said, could you come into Flagship tomorrow? I would like [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1245.9199999999998s)]
*  to give a presentation on the vision. The concocting will talk about platform building. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1250.3999999999999s)]
*  So in the CEO world, you have to be ready to hustle and respond and react. So we had that [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  conversation I remember talking about. And Flagship, the Flagship partnership, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1263.6s)]
*  are one of the ultimate platform building company groups. So showing that you have a platform that [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1269.36s)]
*  you can do this multiple times, that you can do it on demand, and you really can do something [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1276.56s)]
*  that's not been done before. And then if you really, that's principle one. Are you building [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1283.84s)]
*  a platform company? Show that you can do it multiple times. From a preclinical perspective, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1291.84s)]
*  do you have the right data set? Then you can pick projects that can become your portfolio. You can [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1296.72s)]
*  pick projects that you can partner with potential partner companies as well. But if you really take [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1302.8s)]
*  the time and the emphasis and the investment into knowing that you've got a platform and you're [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1310.9599999999998s)]
*  recruiting people who want to build platform companies versus just saying, yeah, of course, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1316.24s)]
*  we want to get to that site. Yes, of course, we want to do it. But spending the time to ensure [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1321.36s)]
*  that that mindset and that culture is built in, it starts to come back. It's incredibly important. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1327.12s)]
*  So it's not just from an investor perspective, it's also from a team. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1333.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. When you stepped into the role at Ampersand, what, five months ago, you're well aware [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1337.0400000000002s)]
*  of the environment, the financial environment when you take that position. How did you personally [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1350.72s)]
*  rationalize that? Like stepping into a startup in a pretty rocky time? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1360.8s)]
*  The capital market's been turbulent as you're living to for some time, both in the private as [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1371.3600000000001s)]
*  well as public markets and sector, macro forces and sector-specific forces. And having learned a [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1377.68s)]
*  lot from the Magentra experience as a private company CEO and a public company CEO was very [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1386.48s)]
*  helpful to me to rationalize that. But in my opinion, at the time, my view was that that type [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1392.64s)]
*  of turbulence actually selects to the best science and it selects to the best opportunities and the [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1401.44s)]
*  best teams. And so I found it relatively in my opinion straightforward to filter and think about [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1408.8s)]
*  that. And so where I got to know Ampersand was a blow away, like amazing opportunity. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1416.8799999999999s)]
*  So the world around became very still. And I think you've all referred to it as the poly crisis. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  Because the drives innovation, it drives opportunity. And for me, it was actually [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1433.36s)]
*  relatively straightforward. Seeing the science and those principles, I talked about the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1439.92s)]
*  opportunities in the team. Yeah. All right. So let's talk about the team, the science, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1446.24s)]
*  those were probably the first and easiest boxes to check. The patient impact, I want to have a [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1454.24s)]
*  conversation around the platform. Dig into the platform and then translate that to the, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1461.84s)]
*  she clicks away, but that's the intended patient impact. You talked briefly about the [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1470.48s)]
*  address now, the determinant, and trademarked and platform. Give us a little more color on that. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1477.04s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. So basically the three pillars to platform, the address, that first, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1486.32s)]
*  so that's that big data set. They were constantly curating, constantly updating and increasing. So [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  we have lots of data, over a terabyte in data, which is over a hundred billion data points. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1498.6399999999999s)]
*  Across disease, across different OX, across different proteins, and so mapping tissues and [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1507.84s)]
*  cells that exquisite well, together with an algorithm you can use to predict addresses [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1514.96s)]
*  as constantly being updated in a team of computational biologists and a team of [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1521.52s)]
*  scientists who work very closely within the flagship primary intelligence team of the cloud [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1526.08s)]
*  system. So lots of really heavy duty data and scientists. So then the second pillar is the [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1531.3600000000001s)]
*  navigator. So building these molecules in silico, which I think is really being a massive [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1540.24s)]
*  step forward for the industry over the last several years. And the goal is to do that and [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1545.84s)]
*  basically what it takes in years, in two months to design molecules and fine tune them. So in [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1552.8s)]
*  the case we've got antibodies and an active drug, we can fine tune those in silico. So we can take [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1558.96s)]
*  an approved drug and make it better, not just by telling it to the right place, but by optimizing [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1567.76s)]
*  it. And then the determinant piece, which is when we make a couple of these molecules, we can test [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1572.96s)]
*  them in the lab. So we have lab-based scientists who run these studies and then the data that [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1580.96s)]
*  come out of these studies very quickly feed back into the platform through machine learning. And [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1587.44s)]
*  the platform becomes even more powerful and more active. So that's the trick. Last week announced [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1592.72s)]
*  we acquired an antibody discovery platform company in York. So the reason we did that was because [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  we were starting to see the science emerge from the platform and we knew that we would need to [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1614.16s)]
*  make antibody binding. And Abcheck had the experience, the capabilities to be able to do that [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1620.16s)]
*  with full stack discovery technologies in the lab, including cutting-edge technologies like [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1629.68s)]
*  microslobics and functional antibody screening. So you can go end to end to generate [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1637.92s)]
*  sample-grade antibodies. They have a huge amount of experience. So on day one, we became an [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1643.84s)]
*  integrated antibody discovery company. We can now take a really cool platform, early science, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1650.24s)]
*  and start to make medicines and then to the clinic. Very different. So we basically not only [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1656.24s)]
*  doubled the size of the company, but we became a different company because of that and really [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1661.84s)]
*  accelerated the development. So it's somewhat unusual for a startup company to be acquiring a [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1666.56s)]
*  platform company. Often happens. I give lots of credit to Flagship and the Amcos-Amnabic [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1673.44s)]
*  ships together going through that. It's going to be exciting for the future of this ship. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1683.1200000000001s)]
*  A bunch of follow-up questions there, but I want to start with one of the boxes that you had to [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1692.24s)]
*  check and that was the people. In a company such as you're describing, it's a common refrain that [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1695.6000000000001s)]
*  the marriage, and I see it getting better. I want your perspective on it. The marriage of [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1703.76s)]
*  computational biology and computational anything, right? The tech folks and the science folks, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1708.64s)]
*  it's a difficult one to officiate. So I've heard multiple approaches. I've talked to biotech CEOs [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1717.28s)]
*  who are in this space and the AI space who've talked about throwing them in a room together, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1727.04s)]
*  making sure they're in close proximity and they start speaking the same language as a starting [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1733.04s)]
*  point. What are your thoughts on that? How are you making sure that that box, those people, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1737.52s)]
*  are the rare breed that can walk both sides of that line, right? Or at least work together on [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1744.8799999999999s)]
*  other things? Yes. So we start with the business. So we have one company, right? I've been down to [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1753.12s)]
*  share vision and so on. And so, you know, having our team onsite, we now have two sites, right? But [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1760.08s)]
*  certainly together in the same room talking about the science, but also it works both ways, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1768.0s)]
*  this communication dialogue. So it's also about the computational biology team sharing what they're [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1773.76s)]
*  doing and our lab-based scientists sharing what they're doing and listening to each other, you [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1780.0s)]
*  know, those two different sides. But I think you're right in terms of alluding to the different [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1784.48s)]
*  backgrounds and different cultures. If you're in front of the computer doing all your work on the [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1790.0s)]
*  computer every day, yeah, if you're a scientist in the lab, it's almost two different levels. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1794.48s)]
*  Right. I think it's part of my job, part of the leadership's job, to make sure that we are able [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1801.04s)]
*  to communicate within the company as well and share that knowledge and share that culture together. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1807.6s)]
*  I think another thing you have to put on the table and say, look, this could be a challenge. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1815.28s)]
*  So let's A, recognize that, B, think about how we continue to communicate transparently and share [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1820.24s)]
*  information. Yeah. When you look at the talent pool that's available to you to serve those needs, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1826.96s)]
*  are you seeing change there in terms of like what academia is putting out, you know, people who are [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1833.44s)]
*  well-versed in both languages, understanding the value of computational, you know, coming [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1839.84s)]
*  in outside side and vice versa. Like, do you, you know, I mean, when the concept began, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1844.72s)]
*  there really wasn't, I'm assuming, in academia, an academic path toward being a computational [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1850.3999999999999s)]
*  biologist. Yes. So I think what we're seeing now, my sense, John's sense, is we're actually seeing [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1858.8s)]
*  folks on the biologist side moving into their second or third roles in industry. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1866.24s)]
*  So I think people join earlier stage companies, bringing more experience now from within the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1873.1200000000001s)]
*  industry together with the academic track of what kind of roles. And so I think there's a [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1878.32s)]
*  very interesting maturation of the talent pool happening right now very quickly. And I think [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1884.24s)]
*  so that's being accelerated as well by a number of the company changes that we've seen in the [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1891.44s)]
*  sector the last year. So that's also happening in the biology side as well. And I think that's [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1899.44s)]
*  helping, right? In terms of how we're improving and think about talent and developing. Yeah. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1907.92s)]
*  Another common refrain around AI and ML is that like, you know, there are obvious benefits and [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1914.32s)]
*  applications happening in terms of speed of discovery and speed of design efficiency. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1922.4s)]
*  But a question that comes up often in my conversation is what the next application [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1928.8s)]
*  for these technologies is when you enter the clinic. Like, because that's where the expenses [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1934.48s)]
*  amount, that's where failure happens quickly. Sometimes not so quickly. Failure happens after [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1942.48s)]
*  a lot of money is invested. Do you have any thoughts on that? Like where a company like Ampersand, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1950.72s)]
*  as it continues out sort of the clinical continuum, where it might be able to leverage some of these [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1956.64s)]
*  technologies to improve efficiencies beyond discovery and design? Yeah. So I think there's [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1962.56s)]
*  a couple of areas. It's a great question. And I do think it's a very important question for us [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1969.28s)]
*  in the industry. Going back to that 90% failure rate number. Yeah. So how do we take clinical [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  data, early translational medicine data and feedback into our use of data? It's almost like [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1980.8s)]
*  a continuum of our lab-based data. How can we learn quickly from our medicines early in the [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1986.96s)]
*  clinic versus late in development? And so I see a natural opportunity to start applying MSR, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=1994.8799999999999s)]
*  ARTEP platform, Ampersand, machine learning with more molecules. And we're definitely [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2001.76s)]
*  intent to do that. I mean, I'm an adult within flagship ecosystem that pioneered [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2008.0s)]
*  IntelliJ, it's so essential. Being an AI machine learning team within flagship and across flagship, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2014.1599999999999s)]
*  that is a huge area. The announcement this week with the Samsung partnership, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2020.8s)]
*  flagship, there's some of that element within that partnership and clinical trial centers. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2029.52s)]
*  Yeah. Can you share anything in terms of like what a pipeline development plan might look like? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2036.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. So that is very exciting. So as I mentioned, building out a platform [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2044.6399999999999s)]
*  versus only out of the platform. And then we have projects that Ampersand ongoing. We have [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2049.44s)]
*  around a dozen active projects going out across different diseases. What I will tell you, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2058.64s)]
*  first of all, is all of those projects have big and apophonic propositions clinically. So we've [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2064.48s)]
*  really directed the platform early on. Hard, hard problems. Not easy, small step changes, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2070.48s)]
*  modified of molecules safety, but can we improve both policy and safety with the same type [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2079.28s)]
*  that in molecules that have failed, red ball molecules on new drugs are not being used [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2086.08s)]
*  in a broader patient population as possible. So I will say at this point, we are seeing some [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2091.92s)]
*  really nice data in autoimmune, immunocollegic. Can we target tumors more effectively? Wow. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2099.6s)]
*  Avoiding side effects of some very powerful mechanisms. So we're seeing some very nice [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2109.8399999999997s)]
*  data there. So we'll talk more about the portfolio as it evolves, but we think about it from our own [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2113.68s)]
*  core portfolio. And then also what we do partnerships. There are some areas, disease areas, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2120.96s)]
*  where it would be incredibly synergistic to apply the Ampersand platform and for Ampersand to [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2126.88s)]
*  develop into those areas with a partner that brings up expertise. Potentially brings drugs [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2133.6800000000003s)]
*  that they want to optimize and send to the right place. So it would be easy and natural. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2139.52s)]
*  Areas that would allow the interest worry, addicts and vassals discussions [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2144.48s)]
*  to work during this week in changing more. Yeah, that's part of our vision. Meeting, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2147.76s)]
*  so it seems a lot more excitement. A platform company has all sorts of optionality in terms [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2153.84s)]
*  of partnerships, exits, mergers, optionality is like the name of that game. Do you run sort of, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2159.6s)]
*  obviously you're in early, but looking forward, are you running kind of fast and loose and looking [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2170.88s)]
*  for opportunities like wherever they might present themselves? Or do you have some sort [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2177.04s)]
*  of an idea like, this is a platform that we could outsource or this is a platform that we could [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2180.24s)]
*  handily stick around forever spinning off products that we then sell or is it, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2185.3599999999997s)]
*  opportunity presents itself when you realize it, when you see it. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2192.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So it's a, you spend a lot of time thinking about on our ships and initial partnership, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2195.68s)]
*  early partnerships for a platform company are very important. First of all, because they have the [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2204.7999999999997s)]
*  opportunity to validate the work. And then second is to build out projects, programs that potentially [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2210.3199999999997s)]
*  wouldn't do, they are a cataclysm company. So we spend a lot of time planning through the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2217.6s)]
*  storage how they could look so that we are, I would say, ready and prepared for opportunities, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2223.68s)]
*  right? Versus being loose and unprepared. I should have known the response I was going to [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2232.32s)]
*  get to that. But maximizing optionality. I would say there's no type of partnership, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2237.76s)]
*  there's no type of deal structure or therapy scenario that we would not consider because [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2246.0s)]
*  platforms are bored down to the same. The question is really in terms of our quantity and quality, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2252.2400000000002s)]
*  what we decide to do internally and that makes sense. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2258.64s)]
*  Is there a, all indicators, not all indicators, but many indicators are kind of pointing to [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2263.2s)]
*  a return of the markets, right? Like things are starting to look better. In a situation like yours, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2270.16s)]
*  when you're looking for an open to early deals, early platform deals, is there a more ideal sort [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2275.8399999999997s)]
*  of market condition for that kind of thing and a less ideal market condition? Like would it be a [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2283.52s)]
*  scenario where you might go, you know what, like we're ready, but we could probably strike some [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2288.48s)]
*  better deals if it's six months from now and some of these indicators like inflation and, you know, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2293.76s)]
*  the merger M&A markets continue to look good and deals are looking better. We're going to kind of [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2300.8s)]
*  hold our cards a little bit. Right. Is that a fair question to ask? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2306.32s)]
*  Well, I think it's a cool way. I mean, I look at it a different way, Matt, which is, you know, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2311.44s)]
*  what do you control and what do you not control? So we all control the market forces into the [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2315.52s)]
*  right thing to market in places where we do control the market. So you think about these [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2321.7599999999998s)]
*  types of partnerships, when and how it probably creates such a big transport. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2328.0s)]
*  But I would like to take a step back because as we think about this platform, you must be following, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2333.52s)]
*  I've seen the explosion of antibody drug conjugate, you know, on shirts, approvals, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2339.6s)]
*  M&A acquisition. Antibody drug conjugates are really the core starting point of what we do at [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2347.44s)]
*  Amverson. Except we're not just working on tumors. Using three classes of payloads, toxic payloads [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2354.16s)]
*  and 11 tumor targets, we're actually able to deliver different types of molecules, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2361.68s)]
*  active drugs to multiple tissues. Right. So this is like the next generation of antibody drug [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2366.88s)]
*  conjugates. So this whole concept of targeting drugs to the right places where they're needed, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2373.6s)]
*  we see ADTC as being a food principle at that. But in a very small target space, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2378.7200000000003s)]
*  that in targets. So we have close to 700 targets across different tissues. Yeah, that can be [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2385.84s)]
*  troubleful. So when you think about, you know, the weight of interest in ADCs, the types of [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2392.4s)]
*  market conditions, I find that very interesting from a micro sector perspective within biotech, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2399.76s)]
*  that obviously is very different from macro forces. I think we could talk about high-rate [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2405.52s)]
*  pressure, and how them play a role in the industry at writ large, and how innovation, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2411.52s)]
*  truth, you know, high quality science and much patient impact with platform complex [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2419.52s)]
*  are incredibly powerful. Yeah. What's the next big step for Amberson? Like what's your, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2425.6800000000003s)]
*  obviously you're here, that's a big step in a busy week. When you get back to your day to day, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2434.0s)]
*  like what's the next step? So this year is going to be exciting. We're going to see more science [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2440.7200000000003s)]
*  emerge from the platform, selecting our first set of lead projects to move forward to develop [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2445.76s)]
*  candidates. And there's a complete milestone. And then executing on partnerships. We have a lot to [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2452.48s)]
*  do this year. We just acquired a company, obviously did that last week. So building out the [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  antibody discovery capabilities, and lots of execution. We are in discussions with both [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2464.2400000000002s)]
*  partners and investors about the next chapter. It's all built on science and the story and [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2470.32s)]
*  antibody proposition. There's a lot going on. It's just great. Yeah, it is a lot. Your plate is full. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2474.72s)]
*  Another question about that acquisition. Whenever you acquire a company, obviously it's disruptive. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2483.12s)]
*  It's good. I mean, there's value, but it's also disruptive, you know, to the mission you were on [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2491.2s)]
*  prior to the acquisition. So give us some color on how you're sort of managing through the integration [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2498.96s)]
*  of this company. Maybe even some illustration of what that integration is going to look like in [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  terms of like, you know, physical space and interviewing people. Sure. So we had a head start [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2509.28s)]
*  with Amtrak because we had already been working with them. I forgot to get the story. So we had [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2515.92s)]
*  that relationship last year. And then we were already planning for success. So we were already [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2523.04s)]
*  partnering to get the antibody together. So both groups working together to issue about, you know, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2529.68s)]
*  decision-making communication. So that basically the Czech Republic, you know, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2535.36s)]
*  so it's time to do a good job. They are used to, we are used to working across time zones, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2539.2s)]
*  working by video conferences, but you know, really playing that forward and can be overly [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2545.52s)]
*  communicative. And so started to lay out objectives and plans. And it's actually, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2551.6s)]
*  you know, it's early days, it's going well so far, but planning for, you know, what could go wrong [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2560.24s)]
*  before it happens. And then being able to communicate, I think is incredibly important [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2566.64s)]
*  from a culture perspective, you know. And so that's something that we're working on [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2572.24s)]
*  together. Yeah. Preparing for this year and beyond. And also that within the flagship ecosystem, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2578.24s)]
*  that capability is also very powerful. Being able to generate our antibodies, not just at Amtrak, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2584.72s)]
*  together with other flagship companies as well. We're going to see this platform [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2591.44s)]
*  really accelerate the next year. It's outstanding. What haven't I covered? Like what, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2599.36s)]
*  if I were a better interviewer, what should I imagine you that I didn't? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2605.44s)]
*  I think we covered the full landscape here. Yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2609.36s)]
*  You either have nothing great or you're waiting whether why you go without. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2620.32s)]
*  Yeah. And then I get asked a lot is what keeps you awake at night? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2624.16s)]
*  It's a good question. Yeah. It's always a combination of data and people. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2630.16s)]
*  Data and people keep you up at night? It's all constantly. Yeah. We're thinking about [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2634.08s)]
*  what will the dates look like, how to recruit for the best talent, right? How do we compete? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2639.7599999999998s)]
*  How do we build company? The combination of that is [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2645.7599999999998s)]
*  any co-occurrency or it's thinking about that. Yeah. I'm not going to tell you that. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2651.6s)]
*  When you say data, the data that keeps you awake, be more specific. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2658.08s)]
*  Oh, about data. What's the next data set looks like over Amtrak? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2662.08s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Not the machine learning, not the data sets that you're using in the applications. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2666.48s)]
*  You're talking about the data sets for machine learning. Actually, when we see the data in the [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2671.84s)]
*  lab on these molecules that come out of the M% platform, we almost cannot lose because on the [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2675.68s)]
*  one hand, the data from the lab experiments could be positive, right? The molecules work. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2682.16s)]
*  If they're being designed, that's cool. That's great. If they're built for the platform, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2688.56s)]
*  for example, the potential partner, they don't work. So it's hugely valuable because that's [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2693.04s)]
*  its platform. And the machine like that uses training data sets. They're like gold, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2699.04s)]
*  both positive and negative. So as a machine learning platform, your platform gets stronger [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2704.24s)]
*  on the positive and negative data. It results in experiments that you can run with the right [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2708.24s)]
*  controls. Yeah. That negative data, the failure data, the stuff that doesn't work, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2712.64s)]
*  is that largely proprietary? Oh, you're talking about the complexity. Yeah. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2718.24s)]
*  Purposefully? Yeah. Yeah. We actually like to make a couple molecules that [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2723.52s)]
*  we think are not going to work as well to test the negatives and all hypotheses. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2728.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Other than just having a no treatment, if you like, control, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2732.9599999999996s)]
*  you have to make a molecule that is designed not to work as well. That's interesting. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2737.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I was talking to someone earlier today who was talking about a panel presentation here at [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2743.3599999999997s)]
*  this event that addressed that issue that in the public domain, there's plenty of success data, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2748.64s)]
*  right? Yes. To pull from, but there's very little in the way of deep failure data. And that was [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2756.0s)]
*  acknowledged as a problem as AI and ML become more pervasive in the process. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2761.76s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I think the under reports in negative data has been with us as an industry [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2768.32s)]
*  for a long time. I think from a culture perspective, in terms of building a company, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2776.0s)]
*  recognizing the importance of getting to know the Syshe products through negative data is really [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2781.5200000000004s)]
*  up. Yeah. I think the best companies are able to recognize and celebrate that. I understand how [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2787.36s)]
*  that could be of high quality and very impactful piece. But now, to go back to the platform, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2793.76s)]
*  machine learning is incredibly important. High quality data starts bleeding back in, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2798.6400000000003s)]
*  and then no out occurs with that anymore. You framed that question that I should have asked as [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2803.6s)]
*  what keeps me up at night, which has sort of a negative intonation, like a concerned intonation. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2809.52s)]
*  Are the things that keep you up at night in a concerned way the same things that excite you? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2816.48s)]
*  Oh, sure. Yeah, absolutely. And so, just to go back to this piece of living without unity [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2822.08s)]
*  and optionality can actually drive, I think, great innovation, confidence, finding solutions quickly. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2830.48s)]
*  And flagship, this is called paranoid optimism. Avert the turn. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2838.48s)]
*  So it exists on a daily basis, packaging the CEO world. And it comes to that point, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2845.44s)]
*  there was just Renstein, he had to be able to, I don't know about mentors over the years, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2851.52s)]
*  telling me spend time predicting the future. Because if you're not as a CEO, nobody else [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2857.44s)]
*  can do that effectively. And trying to do that and also be a paranoid, both optimistic in the role [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2864.32s)]
*  is very challenging, super exciting. And so sometimes we get exciting data and positive [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2872.64s)]
*  data when we least expect it, and the opposite can be true as well in the industry. But early [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2880.24s)]
*  discovery platform companies at this time, and I think within the flagship ecosystem, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2885.04s)]
*  is a great place to be. Yeah, that's terrific. All right, so personal question, because paranoia [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2891.44s)]
*  and optimism can both be unhealthy. If taken to too large a dose, what do you do to, personally, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2896.2400000000002s)]
*  like what do you do to decompress to make sure that you're not taking your paranoia and your [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2904.4s)]
*  height home with you and to keep your sanity? Yeah, simple, turn up left, right and good, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2911.68s)]
*  yeah. Stop that, and then else is straightforward. Very good. Yeah. Well, I appreciate the time. This [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2919.36s)]
*  has been very insightful and I enjoyed meeting with you. I thank you for spending, I know it's a, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2926.48s)]

*  No question, Matt. Yeah, I enjoyed it. Thank you. Good to meet you. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfZAD35q1zU&t=2934.88s)]
