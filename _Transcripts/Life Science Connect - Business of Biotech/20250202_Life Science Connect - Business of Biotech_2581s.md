# BoB@JPM: Stefan Scherer, M.D., Ph.D., 3T Bioscience
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg)
*  Welcome back to the Business of Biotech JP Morgan edition. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm here in San Francisco with Dr. Stefan Scherer. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=8.44s)]
*  The last time I talked with Dr. Scherer, he was traversing the Swiss Alps and it was just [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=12.32s)]
*  last week if I'm not mistaken. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=18.0s)]
*  We started a conversation about a biotech's transition from the research phase to clinical [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=20.68s)]
*  phase. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=27.72s)]
*  Today in San Francisco at JPM, we're going to carry that conversation on. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  Dr. Scherer, it's a pleasure to have you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=33.08s)]
*  Thank you for joining me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=35.28s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=36.28s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here and a pleasure to talk to you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=37.8s)]
*  The pleasure is all mine. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=40.56s)]
*  I want to start the conversation with some background on you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=42.76s)]
*  So you're a PhD, MD-PhD. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=45.72s)]
*  You've got experience in internal medicine and molecular oncology. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=48.56s)]
*  And whenever I have the opportunity to interview an MD who did some clinical work, I'm always [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=54.2s)]
*  curious about why they chose the pharma path. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=58.32s)]
*  So take us back to that inflection point in your life when you decided you were going [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=61.92s)]
*  to move into pharma. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=66.64s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=68.12s)]
*  I was always interested basically in medicine and this was one of the careers I was early [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=69.92s)]
*  on in my school thinking about to go in medicine or bio life sciences, so to say. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=74.56s)]
*  So at that time basically then I actually got a place in med school. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=81.12s)]
*  I started it, liked it, became MD and was treating patients. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  And that was very rewarding and this is a very nice job. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  I really liked it, enjoyed it, to help patients, to treat patients and see basically the success, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=98.28s)]
*  so to say you have. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=103.12s)]
*  What I was missing there a little bit was the deeper science. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=104.12s)]
*  I always wanted to understand not only how to treat patients, how to diagnose patients [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=108.12s)]
*  and I also wanted to understand what is the cause of the disease. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  What drives the disease? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=116.64s)]
*  What makes the cancer basically cancer? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=117.76s)]
*  Why does it come to a situation that cells mutate and proliferate and don't stop? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=120.12s)]
*  And that was a piece which was at the time when I studied, so to say, not so much a part [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=126.56s)]
*  of the curriculum. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=130.96s)]
*  So and then I decided at that time to branch out basically into a separate PhD. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=132.32s)]
*  And after that I spent some time in Albert Einstein doing research and then actually [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=137.68s)]
*  became the inflection point, so to say what to do in a way, how to combine one and the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=143.08s)]
*  other in medicine and science the best way. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=147.56s)]
*  And that's kind of what drove me to industry where I saw basically drug development is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  a piece where medicine, clinical experience, but also basically science and scientific [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=156.24s)]
*  input how to develop the drugs, which kind of mutations, which kind of disease, which [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  kind of conditions to treat kind of matches. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=165.44s)]
*  And this is the moment where I sort of get right out and give it a shot and then started [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=169.72s)]
*  in industry and enjoyed actually the complexity, enjoyed also the interaction with basically [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=175.0s)]
*  as I said patients on one hand, still science on the other, but also basically the business [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=181.96s)]
*  aspect came in and I found a fascinating triangle, the medicine, the science and the business. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=187.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah that business experience is interesting to me too. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=192.8s)]
*  When and where did that come into your sort of circle of influence? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=197.44s)]
*  Was it at Westlake Partners? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=202.28s)]
*  No, I was earlier basically in Big Pharma because you learn there basically that not [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=203.6s)]
*  only to develop a medicine matters, it also matters basically can the medicine come to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=208.56s)]
*  the market, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=214.36s)]
*  So what's the business aspect because at the end of the day in order to keep innovation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=215.44s)]
*  going in order to develop the next drug, you need to return some of the investment, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=219.52s)]
*  So means the truck needs to be successful in the market and in order to get there you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=224.6s)]
*  learn early on that it's not only about science and medicine, it's basically also you need [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  to serve the patient and the shareholders. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  And in this business aspect you learn gradually in the process of being in Big Pharma and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=239.12s)]
*  drug development. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=245.84s)]
*  Certainly it's amplified if you work with venture partners or in VCs like what I did [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=246.84s)]
*  as an EII in Westlake and later on that's certainly amplified because this is kind of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=253.14s)]
*  not only to help one company and one truck to come to the market you want to amplify [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=258.06s)]
*  that and do this 10, 20, 50 whatever the capacity of the fund is. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, did you readily embrace that coming from a scientific background treating patients [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=268.14s)]
*  working on the development of medicine? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=274.02s)]
*  Did you embrace the business aspect? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=277.26s)]
*  I mean in the beginning it was a learning curve, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean in the beginning you come very much with a scientific mind and a scientific or [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=281.62s)]
*  medical head so to say and it's more about science and medicine but it evolves over time, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=285.78s)]
*  right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=292.58s)]
*  Over time you learn that the business aspect is I would say equally important than science [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=293.58s)]
*  and medicine on the other side and this is something which you kind of when you want [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=298.54s)]
*  to bring a truck to the market you need to understand what's the competition, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=303.5s)]
*  Can I enter the market? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=307.2s)]
*  Under which condition can I enter the market? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=308.2s)]
*  What's the pricing and the scheme looking like? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=310.66s)]
*  What will be access? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=312.42s)]
*  How can I even make it possible that patient can get to the truck, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=313.42s)]
*  And there is this is in the globally speaking very diverse and in this aspect basically [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=317.42s)]
*  you learned this very early on in a way that business and commercial parts matter equally [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  as much. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  Tell us about the entrepreneur in residence position at Westlake. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=332.62s)]
*  It's an interesting, I imagine that had to be a very interesting position for you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=336.38s)]
*  Tell us what that entails. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=340.58s)]
*  Yeah, Westlake has a very interesting model actually. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=341.58s)]
*  So then they look for people who come with relevant experience in the field of medicine, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=345.06s)]
*  translational medicine, biomarkers but also basically the commercial and business aspects [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=351.34s)]
*  of truck development and with that basically they give you the opportunity to basically [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=357.78s)]
*  look a year in a way prospecting. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=364.38s)]
*  So what kind of company you want to work with or you want to build actually with Westlake [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=366.9s)]
*  as a in the background so to say. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  And this is really a year where you spend time looking at tons and tons of opportunities [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=375.38s)]
*  right across the board and with the help of Westlake you also have a lot of freedom to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=381.7s)]
*  kind of branch out and talk to check transfer officers, talk to universities, basically [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  talk to pharma because they want to out license some molecules which they are off strategy, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=393.58s)]
*  they don't want to do from a development perspective. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=398.94s)]
*  So you learn a lot. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=401.78s)]
*  It's really enriching. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=403.9s)]
*  And then after a year kind of in a way for me was nine months basically I landed at 3T [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=406.06s)]
*  and was doing basically due diligence and identified the opportunity for diesel by [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=412.78s)]
*  specifics as one of which we certainly were supposed to invest at that time and this is [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=418.54s)]
*  then how I transitioned later then from Westlake into 3T Biosciences. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=424.22s)]
*  What was 3T Biosciences at the time that you joined and what capacity did you join the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=429.82s)]
*  company? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=434.74s)]
*  3T was a platform company so there's a platform we licensed out from Stanford, Chris Garcia's [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=435.74s)]
*  lab in Stanford and it's a very diverse platform. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  It's very cutting edge from a perspective of target ID and also looking into cross-reactivities [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=446.85999999999996s)]
*  and this platform was out licensed and the team was kind of trying to industrialize the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=454.14s)]
*  platform to make the platform more high throughput to make it basically a platform which is not [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=459.09999999999997s)]
*  only academic and scientific which also can kind of bring trucks to the market and bring [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=464.41999999999996s)]
*  and identify molecules at the end of the day we can treat patients. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=469.5s)]
*  And I joined this was kind of a wider portfolio of opportunities and in various directions [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=474.1s)]
*  cell based therapies, diesel by specifics etc. so it was very much a research company [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=481.46000000000004s)]
*  and then we were sitting down looking what is the best of what you can take it forward [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=486.62s)]
*  what can we really do with this platform in order to serve patients to help patients and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=490.58000000000004s)]
*  being a little bit more on the forefront of science and next generation medicines and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=495.06s)]
*  then we identified the opportunity basically that diesel by specifics could be the niche [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=499.82s)]
*  if you want right where 3T can play and which is coming in the next three four five years [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=506.98s)]
*  an important modality for treatment of patients and then we focused the company purely on [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=512.98s)]
*  diesel by specifics and solid tumors. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=518.38s)]
*  You no doubt had options right coming out of Westlake was there a specific hook about [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=521.86s)]
*  3T that compelled you to make that decision to choose 3T? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=528.54s)]
*  Yeah I mean 3T was and still is of course a very innovative company so what 3T combines [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=532.94s)]
*  is a few things first of all it really has a platform so it's not a single agent one [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=539.78s)]
*  hit wonder type of thing right so one asset and bringing it to the market and sell it [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=545.26s)]
*  it's actually a platform and has the opportunity to develop more than one drug second it has [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=550.58s)]
*  also the components of AIML in a way embedded in drug development so the complexity of the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=556.1s)]
*  platform the complexity of the data is beyond the human brain so in order to analyze this [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=563.1s)]
*  and in order to match that basically with human proteome and these things you need much [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=568.7s)]
*  more sophisticated methods and that was something basically early early days in AI right I mean [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=574.5s)]
*  now is a very different story but in this one that was fascinating for me the opportunities [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=581.06s)]
*  so to say this platform gives right and it's not only a thing we can go in oncology I mean [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=587.06s)]
*  could go into immunology autoimmune diseases you could even do vaccines so to say with [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=592.26s)]
*  cancer vaccines or for others I mean and we're not pursuing these opportunities mainly also [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=597.02s)]
*  for reasons of focus and but the diversity and the opportunity does is a new modality [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=602.7s)]
*  kind of was something which drawn me to 3T yeah it's interesting when I have conversations [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=609.26s)]
*  with biotech founders who are reflecting on sort of the partnership opportunity out there [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=614.7s)]
*  the the funding opportunity out there I get a mixed bag of reviews on whether the market [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=620.1800000000001s)]
*  is receptive right now or at any given point to platforms to you know specific targets and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=626.26s)]
*  products AI ML I mean everybody loves that if it's if it's working effectively what what's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=634.14s)]
*  your sense right now of sort of market receptivity to the platform concept versus the lead compound [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=639.78s)]
*  that you're working on yes a very interesting question and I mean when when we started or [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=645.9399999999999s)]
*  when I started with this business platform was key right at that time people invested or [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=650.9s)]
*  primarily invested in companies who had a platform I have access to a platform then all the biotech [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=657.26s)]
*  crisis came right a downturn came and all these things and this was also beginning of COVID 2020 [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=663.42s)]
*  2021 right so in this way in this case and the whole thing shifted to a much much more de-risked [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=668.86s)]
*  model so people wanted to have assets which are in the clinic phase one phase two in essence [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=676.42s)]
*  basically who kind of more de-risked than a platform early early on assets so to say yeah [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=684.5s)]
*  then you as basically as entrepreneur or CEO of a company you have to switch strategies because [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=690.18s)]
*  we invested in platform right and we wanted to have to run basically to develop a pipeline to [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=697.3s)]
*  develop a portfolio and bring it to the clinic etc and this takes years right yeah the market [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=703.82s)]
*  condition shifts in in much less than this many years right in in actually in half a year the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=709.1800000000001s)]
*  market condition was totally different so we had to refocus right and then and this is where we [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=715.58s)]
*  refocus basically the company fully on and the asset we have as a lead asset we continue to do [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=720.5s)]
*  pipeline we did some business deals with Bering Engelheim in order to kind of substantiate and [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=726.86s)]
*  access to additional resources and and this was basically where we then ended up in order to make [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=732.8199999999999s)]
*  the lead compound further successful and we're actually able to bring it to a development [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=739.74s)]
*  candidate and now in the IND phase yeah we talked now to investors basically what many want is a [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=745.1s)]
*  pipeline a portfolio and something in the clinic of course they do they want it all exactly so and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=750.38s)]
*  I mean and even now in JP Morgan we talked to companies and then in the clinic is not good [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=757.02s)]
*  enough anymore either so they want basically then clinical data yeah right so which means end of [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=762.1s)]
*  phase one phase one B phase two whatever and and this goalpost shifting setting is interesting to [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=767.3000000000001s)]
*  maneuver but it's it's from a cash runway perspective it's relatively difficult because [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=775.1800000000001s)]
*  it's almost unplanned yeah yeah all right so I want to spend some time talking about the transition [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=780.26s)]
*  from R&D to clinical but before we do that let's just spend a little bit more time talking about [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=785.98s)]
*  that transition from you know develop using AI NML developing a platform to sort of shifting [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=790.4599999999999s)]
*  the focus to the lead compound when you went through that that phase what did that mean from [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=797.0999999999999s)]
*  sort of a personnel and management standpoint for you as the leader of the company well you have to [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=802.18s)]
*  make hard decisions right in in in this time and we also had to make decisions not only on the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=809.9s)]
*  on the portfolio we also had to make the decision on personnel because if you plan for a big [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=817.38s)]
*  portfolio if you plan for a big pipeline in a way five six seven trucks to develop more or less in [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=822.78s)]
*  parallel you need a different set of scientists right in the company when you learn to need to [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=829.0600000000001s)]
*  focus basically you focus your company on on one or two what we did basically assets and but also [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=835.0600000000001s)]
*  you need to kind of in a way focus your company your hiring plan your development plan from people [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=842.14s)]
*  and resource perspective is very different you know and then you take actions on this as well [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=847.74s)]
*  right and cut down on on people you cut down on hiring plan you you really focus the company on [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=853.02s)]
*  all aspects in order to to do this and this is managerial not easy because not only it's hard [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=860.58s)]
*  decisions it's also difficult to decide so to say when you have two three compounds in the lead [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=867.1s)]
*  which one you want to process right forward and a progress forward and and that's that it was a [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=871.5799999999999s)]
*  lot of let's say strategic meetings discussions deep diving data in order to find basically the [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=878.9s)]
*  molecule we've we found we thought it's it's the one to go forward yeah yeah tell me a little bit [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=886.5799999999999s)]
*  more about that molecule so we have a molecule now basically what we do is teaser by specifics is [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=892.06s)]
*  essentially kind of an antibody format which one arm kind of in a way engages with a peptide HLA [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=897.38s)]
*  expressed on tumor cells and the other arm engages by our CD3 with the T cells so and the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=903.18s)]
*  molecule we identified comes from a patient who suffered colorectal cancer and this was a [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=909.14s)]
*  patient who had this mismatch repair stable MSS colorectal cancer and these cancers actually are [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=914.42s)]
*  generally not susceptible for IO so any I would read many names has not been successful in the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=921.38s)]
*  past and that we identified this this target so to say out of these patients was high percentage [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=929.9s)]
*  in this patient looked in how many other patients could have that and really were surprised because [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=936.54s)]
*  eighty to ninety percent of colon cancer patients have this target and and then we got a little bit [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=941.78s)]
*  lucky here if you want right in a way with this target and then we thought okay this is a big [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=949.86s)]
*  market because colorectal cancer especially MSS where I always not is not working in second and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=954.94s)]
*  third line there is not much available for these patients you know the PFS in first line is about [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=961.26s)]
*  a year the PFS in second line is six months insert line is three months yeah so it goes very much [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=966.3000000000001s)]
*  down so there's a high unmet medical need so that kind of couple of things came together we saw this [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=971.82s)]
*  is a good target right and the target is involved in DNA repair in genomic stability so it's very [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=977.38s)]
*  high expressed in tissues which proliferate so by nature tumor cancer is a high proliferating [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=985.1s)]
*  tissue high proliferating disease if you want so it's a high express target in this disease entity [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=993.46s)]
*  you know we also see it in normal tumors this target in in much much less frequency and that's [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1000.5s)]
*  basically provides us a very good therapeutic window you know so that we feel we won't have [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1007.18s)]
*  we won't hit normal to normal tissue we won't hit normal expressing tissue but we will definitely [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1012.62s)]
*  hit tumor tissue and and that's where we kind of felt like that's a target which is worthwhile to [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1018.9s)]
*  express in high proliferating tissue it's not only in two in in colorectal we also see it in [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1026.26s)]
*  triple negative breast cancer we see it in non-small scleromus and a few others and that of course is [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1031.46s)]
*  again comes back to choices right because we cannot run a phase one trial in five different [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1037.46s)]
*  indications right so that's the second time you have to make basically to make a decision what is [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1042.5s)]
*  your lead indication right and that's where we decided it's the high unmet medical need is [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1049.38s)]
*  this in many of these indications but we went for colorectal cancer so that you made that decision [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1054.42s)]
*  and your goal is to be in the clinic in 2026 is that correct yes that's correct so we are currently [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1060.94s)]
*  in the I&D enabling phase we are basically in the manufacturing part so we manufacture this this [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1067.7800000000002s)]
*  target at the moment now is the CDMO and and we'll have an I&D if everything goes okay by end of [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1073.3s)]
*  the year early next and then foresee our first patient being treated in Q2 early Q2 26 what's [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1081.18s)]
*  the what's the manufacturing environment look like for this particular molecule I'm curious [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1088.8999999999999s)]
*  about you know by specifics are pretty sexy right now if you will is the is the outsource [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1096.82s)]
*  manufacturing community is there capacity in the space there is certainly capacity the thing is [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1101.06s)]
*  on the other hand for us manufacturing become a de-risking situation right because we didn't want [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1109.4199999999998s)]
*  to go to manufacturers who have no experience in manufacturing by specifics because that's a [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1115.54s)]
*  learning curve for them and that's fine right in a way and that's all good but that that poses for [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1121.26s)]
*  us a different risk right because we work with someone who is not necessarily experienced in the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1126.22s)]
*  field so we went to the big guys right so to say and and looked at all who have done this in the [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1130.7s)]
*  past we have shown they can do it etc and and there is actually quite quite a lot of capacity [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1136.74s)]
*  available right in in general for this and and the manufacturing takes a year no matter with whom [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1144.54s)]
*  you talk right right so it's the same timelines roughly yeah yeah all right so let's talk about [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1151.18s)]
*  that management transition from from research to to manufacturing and in preparation for the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1157.58s)]
*  clinic what does that look like and I want to kind of talk talk about that from a personnel [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1164.58s)]
*  standpoint a funding standpoint and maybe partnership standpoint and whatever I mean you [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1169.02s)]
*  know you're living it so whatever other sort of dynamics or forces come into play let's unpack [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1174.9399999999998s)]
*  that a little bit yeah I know it's a great question and it's a it's a great topic because [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1180.4199999999998s)]
*  as I said when I joined 3T we transitioned the company basically from a from a research [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1184.3000000000002s)]
*  platform into a product development company right we were looking into which product we [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1190.8200000000002s)]
*  are developing now we're facing essentially the second transition into a clinical stage [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1196.26s)]
*  biopharma and the people who worked in 3T and still working in 3T and we continue to need them [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1200.74s)]
*  there's no change very much researchers right they help to develop identify the targets help [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1206.74s)]
*  to develop the targets and basically protein scientists protein engineers who really have to [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1212.6599999999999s)]
*  put this molecule the complexity of the molecule together that it can be manufactured now going [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1219.1399999999999s)]
*  in the clinic you need people with clinical development experience yeah so we have to add [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1224.3799999999999s)]
*  on skills to the company which we didn't use and we didn't need before right so now kind of the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1229.3s)]
*  company transitions again into more clinical stage part we need to hire like people with the CMO [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1235.9799999999998s)]
*  background right we need people with clinical development experience clinical operations [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1242.62s)]
*  regulatory affairs etc etc so those are the the skill sets basically we need to add on at the [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1247.02s)]
*  moment and and they're not so easy to find yeah well yeah I was gonna ask about that because all [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1253.54s)]
*  we hear about is the sort of dearth in biotech talent so what are you doing to solve that challenge [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1260.02s)]
*  so maybe we certainly do this on many we try to pursue it on many avenues right I mean we're [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1267.18s)]
*  leveraging of course as much as we can personal networks right in from previous companies we [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1274.26s)]

*  cell based therapies or anything so I need to find not the need in the high stack but you need [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1298.02s)]
*  someone who has the relevant skill set right in this one and that's not that's not so easy right [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1303.06s)]
*  because if you want someone who come in and lead and put his stamp so to say on the program I mean [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1307.38s)]
*  we need one who has a better relatively speaking short learning curve yeah yeah and and this is [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1313.78s)]

*  yeah and that I imagine that hiring up in anticipation of clinical development is sort [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1391.82s)]
*  of the tip of the spear on another inflection point and that would be funding you've got [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1398.34s)]
*  absolutely first you got to pay for these people then you're gonna have to pay for some clinical [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1403.1000000000001s)]
*  trial activity which is which is not inconsequential money so tell me about preparations for that yeah [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1407.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean the money you need for research is not is not small but it's compared to what you need [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1414.26s)]
*  for clinic it's nothing right so because I mean manufacturing is easily double-digit millions [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1419.22s)]
*  yeah and no question about it I mean clinical trial is double-digit millions and so we need [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1425.3s)]
*  to kind of make sure we resource the company adequately in order to get through the clinical [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1432.54s)]
*  trial right it doesn't help me if I have money to get into clinical trial but cannot finish it [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1437.62s)]
*  right that it's not fair to the patient as it's not fair to the investors it's not fair to the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1442.06s)]
*  company so we need to be clear that we resource the company adequately for that so we are now in [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1447.06s)]
*  the race of a B round so we targeting 80 to 100 million for that we have raised from insiders who [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1453.74s)]
*  have been investing in the company previously currently about 45 million so let's say you're [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1460.66s)]
*  halfway through yeah to to the fundraise and we're using JP Morgan and of course also post JP Morgan [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1467.9s)]
*  and the next couple of months to close the round with another 40 to 50 million yeah what's proven [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1474.78s)]
*  perhaps challenging in that effort you know I mean you could come at it from any angle receptivity [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1483.3s)]
*  to an approach that has heretofore been unsuccessful which could excite some investors could turn some [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1492.94s)]
*  investors off right the shipping goalposts you know what investors are looking for what were you [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1500.3s)]
*  I guess what what sort of the temperature of the investment community community for this move into [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1507.58s)]
*  clinicals and what maybe is standing in the way yeah I mean look I mean the teaser by specific is [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1513.14s)]
*  a relatively speaking new area but so totally new right there is previous experience for example [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1519.1s)]
*  immunocore was was able to put Kim track on the market for you will man on OMA right which is [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1525.9s)]
*  very helpful because it shows it's possible right and it shows a molecule like that can actually [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1530.82s)]
*  retreat the disease so can retreat patients right there is others in development this is more CTAs [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1536.46s)]
*  cancer test is antigens like a major form HAA also praying so these developments basically help what [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1543.5800000000002s)]
*  what is a bit like what we hear often is exactly worse I think sweetie can can shine in this way is [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1550.9s)]
*  the cross activity because the people are a little bit afraid with these molecules on side effects [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1558.54s)]
*  this these molecules are really really active so it's it's really a hot molecule if you put into [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1565.7s)]
*  the patient right so what it binds it kills you know no matter if it's normal or no matter if [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1574.66s)]
*  it's tomorrow right of course you want tomorrow you don't want the normal but what you actually [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1580.34s)]
*  target is actually a kind of a 9 10 11 amino acids it's very small peptide so the risk that [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1584.3s)]
*  you find a similar sequence or as a secret homology based thing in elsewhere in the body is not zero [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1592.82s)]
*  because it's very small right so that you find something which is equal either equal or homologic [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1603.22s)]
*  equal from a sequence or from a structural perspective these two things we need to exclude [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1609.8999999999999s)]
*  and in previous experience in the clinic you have seen really very bad side effects you know so [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1615.74s)]
*  one prominent example is made chase we yeah so people put her had a truck against major three [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1623.18s)]
*  and then they said across the activity was Titan Titan is a molecule which is expressed in [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1629.3s)]
*  cardiomyocytes so what happened actually the patients died on cardiogenic shock because the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1634.94s)]
*  molecule killed the heart and not only the tumor so and there is other molecules where basically [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1642.3s)]
*  side effects not of this magnitude but but similar side effects have been preventative of [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1648.26s)]
*  this kind of developing these these tumors further right yeah so and that's where we think the [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1655.22s)]
*  platform we have helps because we can kind of reduce these cross-reactivities in these [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1661.06s)]
*  molecules significantly compared to what has happened in the past that's not the battle right [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1667.74s)]
*  in in order to explain that to investors right as they know this data right and I've seen this [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1673.22s)]
*  data so to explain them that the molecule is relatively speaking safe you know I mean we will [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1678.38s)]
*  see side effects in the clinic right track CRS and a few other things no doubt on this and that we [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1686.9s)]
*  won't see these terrible side effects right what others have seen and and have experienced [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1692.62s)]
*  that's basically something you need to explain to investors and this is this is not easy in the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1697.78s)]
*  current market yeah yeah what about balancing platform development and pipeline and clinical [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1702.34s)]
*  progress now all sort of at the same time how are you how are you tackling that I mean the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1711.1799999999998s)]
*  focus currently our main focus is certainly bring the molecule into clinic right into the [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1717.5s)]
*  IND and this is where probably 80% of the of the funding goes to yeah we were not disregarding [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1721.8999999999999s)]
*  pipeline and certainly not disregarding platform because as I told you investors are more attracted [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1729.74s)]
*  to if you have a platform you have a pipeline and the molecule in the clinic or close to the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1735.3799999999999s)]
*  clinic right so try to fit the bill yeah and we try to make this and a situation where we kind of [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1741.02s)]
*  be kind of in the sweet spot if you want you know for investors enough if that sweet spot moves [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1747.1s)]
*  around again right which it will and then like right like tomorrow it could be like you know [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1754.06s)]
*  what forget about the platforms we need you know we need molecules in clinic we need clinical data [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1758.58s)]
*  what do you do as the leader of the company to sort of obviate for that to prepare for it and be [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1763.54s)]
*  in an agile position to shift if necessary is it even possible it is a platform company it's [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1769.82s)]
*  actually relatively easy possible kind of you can I wouldn't say you turn it down but I mean you can [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1776.26s)]
*  pause it right so the investment you're not losing the platform in a way but you can say okay we [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1782.66s)]
*  pause the target ID which we have done to a large degree in the in the part we had to focus on the [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1788.34s)]
*  lead molecule right and and now we would do similar things basically so we kind of yeah if [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1794.78s)]
*  you want putting less emphasis on the on the pipeline and on the platform certainly the highest [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1802.22s)]
*  the highest investment and resources go into development of the truck and bringing into the [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1809.1000000000001s)]
*  clinic because this is where the value is right this is where the value is in general the second [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1813.7s)]
*  piece basically would be developing trucks which are coming after you know the second and the third [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1818.3s)]
*  molecule and then the pipeline that the target ID would then kind of really pause and with the [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1822.82s)]
*  platform as I mentioned before this is not this is not too difficult and you're not destroying [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1829.3s)]
*  value directly because you keep the platform alive yeah you're not basically running it and [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1835.34s)]
*  and running hundreds and thousands of samples over it yeah what is it tabs is from a resource [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1842.78s)]
*  perspective to keep a platform alive because I mean it theoretically it makes perfect sense right [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1848.34s)]
*  we've got the platform we can always fall back to the platform go back to the platform what does [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1853.02s)]
*  it keep or what does it take to keep that platform alive and ready when called upon from a resource [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1858.5s)]
*  standpoint yeah I mean you you cannot basically let all the people go right or or thinking about [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1866.8200000000002s)]
*  of kind of stripping the company down to just clinical so this doesn't work right because [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1873.14s)]
*  rehiring and retraining the people on a complex platform takes a lot more time than you think [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1879.18s)]
*  right so in that essence you need to keep a core activity on the platform going even if you don't [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1885.14s)]
*  do it right and I mean in our case is actually relatively kind of fortunate if you want because [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1890.8600000000001s)]
*  we're using the platform not only for target ID we also using it for de-risking so in any [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1896.22s)]
*  molecule we bring to the clinic we need trace and the trace platform basically also for for [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1902.46s)]
*  identifying cross-file activities so and this this is the minimal part of the platform we would [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1909.3s)]
*  leave a life right we would not do target ID but we leave it for cross-file activities and this is [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1914.86s)]
*  just a different use of the platform but it's still the same platform so in this case we're not losing [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1920.22s)]
*  people we're not losing competencies we're not losing expertise we would just shift the resources [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1927.02s)]
*  to a different purpose of the platform. Yeah yeah what are you so as I noted we're here in [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1932.66s)]
*  in San Francisco for JP Morgan 2025 it's day two, day two of the conference. Now I'm not gonna ask [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1938.6200000000001s)]
*  for a detailed insight into into your meetings over the course of the last day or so but what [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1946.9s)]
*  is sort of a day in the life of a biotech CEO or you specifically look like here what are you [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1953.96s)]
*  looking to accomplish and how are you spending your time? So at the moment yeah I know I mean [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1960.26s)]
*  look JP Morgan is a is a good venue you know to meet people from the industry right it's a it's [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1964.26s)]
*  one of the biggest gatherings so to say from from biotech and pharma industry in the year I think [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1971.3s)]
*  the big advantage is also you meet you have easier access to senior leaders in the company [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1978.3s)]
*  right if you want to have partnering discussions and and BD business development discussions or [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1983.46s)]
*  kind of also with investors etc etc so this is easier because that the leadership the decision [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1991.46s)]
*  makers say to say are now at one place yeah right if you reach out to a company then you go through [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=1998.42s)]
*  search and evaluation you go to to BD you go to this and it takes it takes a couple of more steps [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2004.26s)]
*  right in order to reach the decision makers and to reach basically the people from development [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2010.26s)]
*  research whatever you need in order to progress the discussions you know here it's all kind of at [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2016.58s)]
*  one place and the meetings kind of happened directly with more decision makers at the at [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2022.62s)]
*  the table than it is and other things so yeah what we do at the moment is this kind of an starts at [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2028.86s)]
*  8 and ends at 11. One is every day so yeah need a bit of a vacation after that. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2034.38s)]
*  Yes, 100%. You'll be back in the Swiss Alps next week. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2040.8600000000001s)]
*  Not really but I'm thinking about it. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2045.5s)]
*  Well that brings up a question I wanted to ask you so like I said when we last spoke last week [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2049.34s)]
*  you were there but 3T is headquartered here in San Francisco is that correct? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2053.58s)]
*  It's based in South San Francisco so it's where it all started in Stanford so to say right and we [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2059.2599999999998s)]
*  kept the company and the research here we have a small base in Switzerland for talent acquisition [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2064.3799999999997s)]
*  so to say I mean Basel is a is an interesting town so from a pharma perspective right you have [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2070.54s)]
*  Roche Novartis and others and I mean as these companies are also restructuring and people [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2077.5s)]
*  looking for new opportunities etc etc not everyone can move to San Francisco not everyone can [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2083.2599999999998s)]
*  yeah can accept a US contract in a way so we made a decision if they can't come to us we come to them [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2089.66s)]
*  so and then we opened a small office in Switzerland and that enables us access to talent [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2097.8999999999996s)]
*  and so at the moment is more like development people a few they are so to say it's very small [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2104.94s)]
*  and but as we grow into clinical space we may grow this as well further yeah. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2110.54s)]
*  Is that home for you or is San Francisco? No for me it's actually a mix between Europe and here [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2116.3s)]
*  so I'm frequently here yeah and officially my home is actually in New Jersey. Oh okay so not [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2123.5800000000004s)]
*  quite splitting the difference but yeah that's where my home is yeah very nice when you talked [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2131.7400000000002s)]
*  about coming out here and spending your time you know forging partnerships and meeting with [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2139.26s)]
*  business decision makers as opposed to sort of trying to work your way past gatekeepers [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2145.5s)]
*  out there in the real world what is how much prep work goes into that like making sure that [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2150.0600000000004s)]
*  you're going to be in the right place at the right time creating meeting opportunities in advance of [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2154.6200000000003s)]
*  coming here or are you just so good you can like walk the streets and recognize all the people you [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2158.1400000000003s)]
*  want to meet with? No certainly you have over years in pharma industry and in working two three [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2164.0600000000004s)]
*  companies you have built a network because I mean people also kind of branching out right so they [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2170.38s)]
*  they're not they're moving from companies to other companies and you kind of your network grows a bit [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2175.34s)]
*  in this way naturally right so you you know former friend from Roche is now at at Gilead another one [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2180.7000000000003s)]
*  is that is at Novartis and so on so forth so you can reach out and say hey can you connect me with [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2187.34s)]
*  A B and C right who may be interested in looking at our target right and then this goes both ways [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2192.7000000000003s)]
*  right so to say and then you get connected and you get contacts to the people who are relevant [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2197.9s)]
*  in terms of BD but also basically who are relevant in terms of development and research to make a [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2204.86s)]
*  decision in order is that a molecule this company may be interested in and wants to have in that [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2210.62s)]
*  portfolio or not yeah so that's how things work right in this way and it's a lot of relationship [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2216.46s)]
*  business right and this is also why JP Morgan is good it's kind of you meet them in a [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2224.78s)]
*  biting bite let's say also quote-unquote social setting you know at various receptions and [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2229.6600000000003s)]
*  this and that and then you can you can interact and can connect and that speeds the things up [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2235.26s)]
*  hence the going until 11 p.m. exactly yeah last year at JPM the tone in virtually every [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2242.94s)]
*  conversation I had was this cautiously optimistic take that we're climbing out of a terrible you [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2251.58s)]
*  know M&A venture capital market environment I'm not sensing that as much this year yet you know [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2258.62s)]
*  I feel like the tone is a little bit more stable now what do you think like what's your gut tell [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2272.22s)]
*  you about 2025 in terms of you know some of the activity that's going to make the world go around [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2278.22s)]
*  for biotech I think I think we I think we can probably say the reach bottom right so to say what [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2284.62s)]
*  what's still possible to sustain and to sustain an industry like biotech and and stuff I think [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2291.5s)]
*  there's a lot of quote-unquote holding pattern activities going on right people talk and be [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2298.14s)]
*  getting these conversations but in order to make decisions I think the the change in the [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2304.22s)]
*  administration right in a in a week essentially makes people a little bit pause right so you say [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2309.3399999999997s)]
*  it's it's quote-unquote unpredictable probably what will happen under the new ex new new [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2317.66s)]
*  administration from all perspectives geopolitically tariffs right what will happen with pharma [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2322.54s)]
*  pricing M&A and all these types of things right build their restrictions which we have seen or [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2329.42s)]
*  or some people experience will they be lifted will they not will the tariffs come will the economy go [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2336.46s)]
*  up go down these types of things are everyone has a different perspective and I'm not a banker I'm [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2342.06s)]
*  not an economist but but when you speak to the people a lot of them kind of saying we will wait [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2346.2200000000003s)]
*  maybe a month to two so probably to march something like that get a feel where the world [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2351.42s)]
*  is going you know where the things are going with the new administration and then I think if that [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2358.38s)]
*  is quote-unquote positive or neutral to what we see now actually I'm cautiously optimistic that [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2363.9s)]
*  things will go up in 25 yeah yeah but it's like everyone else charting a you know charting a [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2370.14s)]
*  course right now or planning the course probably isn't the smartest thing to do until we know [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2376.38s)]
*  exactly so we as I said our horizon in order to finish the the race is not the next six eight [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2381.5s)]
*  weeks right our horizon is more six eight months you know because you have to factor in a bit of [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2388.62s)]
*  a standstill so to say for the next two three months due to the big changes I guess or eventually [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2393.9s)]
*  big changes to yeah yeah yeah so what work is going on right now give us a sense for like what [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2400.46s)]
*  you said you're working on ind enabling right now so what's going on day to day and what's [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2408.06s)]
*  the next big sort of milestone for 3t so we as I said we we have kicked off the manufacturing part [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2412.94s)]
*  so we're waiting basically to get our first kind of glp materials you know glp gmp materials in our [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2420.7s)]
*  hand to run kind of in a way in we were talk studies so to say with organ wits and this that [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2427.9s)]
*  will tell us if what we have seen in cell lines and what we have seen in pre-clinical thing holds [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2433.26s)]
*  true in quoting what human samples you know and and materials and then we really gearing up with [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2437.7400000000002s)]
*  writing the phase one protocol preparing interactions with the fda and probably ema in europe [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2446.1400000000003s)]
*  to have eventually present representation of the clinical trial on both sides of the atlantic you [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2453.26s)]
*  know for patient recruitment speed and also introduction into the market you know to get [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2458.46s)]
*  physicians familiar with the molecule etc so that's kind of where 25 will be a busy year [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2463.7400000000002s)]
*  a very busy year in addition we have to recruit the talent we need in order to make that happen [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2470.46s)]
*  especially on the clinical side and and clinical execution side clinical operations [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2476.94s)]
*  so that's the next piece which will come and and then hopefully by the end of the year we can [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2481.42s)]
*  push the button and file for the indy yeah well i wish you luck on that endeavor what haven't i [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2487.98s)]

*  there's nothing i think i mean maybe i asked you a question what's what you're hearing in jp morgan [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2500.54s)]

*  the sense just yet like i said i i'm not feeling as much sort of trepidation and caution as i think [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2518.7799999999997s)]
*  i i did last year but maybe maybe after a few more meetings i'll pick up on that um but yeah [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf40Zti0xg&t=2524.7s)]
