Video Description: This week's guest on the Business of Biotech, EVQLV's Andrew Satz, says AI and ML in biopharma are like sex in high school. "Many of the people who say they're doing it really aren't, and the one who really are aren't talking about it," he says. So, when it comes to the computational biology buzz, what’s real? What’s hype? What’s yielding benefit and what’s merely vaporware? In our talks with the leaders of new and emerging biotechs over the past 12 to 18 months, we've seen a steep increase in the application of – or at the very least, interest in – machine learning, AI, and computational biology tools for drug discovery, development, and beyond. Even those who are using some "ultra-light" application of new computational technology are eager to talk about it, as it’s clearly become as en-vogue as tacking “bio” onto your moniker was a few years back – even among companies who aren’t actually developing biologics. On this episode, Satz offers his take on the reality of adoption and shares advice on the fundamentals of AI and ML in biotech.

*  If there's a noteworthy trend in our talks with the leaders of new and emerging biotechs over the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=39.6s)]
*  past 12 to 18 months, it's a steep increase in the application of, or at the very least, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=43.92s)]
*  interest in machine learning, AI, and computational biology tools in general. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=49.68s)]
*  Even those who are using some ultra light application of new computational technology [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=55.52s)]
*  are eager to talk about it. It's as clearly become as en vogue as tacking bio onto your [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=61.04s)]
*  moniker was a few years ago, even among companies who aren't actually developing biologics. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=67.76s)]
*  So when it comes to the computational biology buzz, what's real? What's hype? What's yielding [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=73.04s)]
*  benefit? And what's merely vaporware? I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business of Biotech, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=78.56s)]
*  and on today's episode, we're coloring outside of the lines a little bit by welcoming a guy who's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=83.6s)]
*  not developing biologics, but is developing computational tools for a variety of antibody [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=88.32s)]
*  design applications. But Andrew Sats is even more than that. Over the course of conversations with [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=95.52s)]
*  him, I've concluded that his 360 degree view of the intersection of life sciences and computational [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  technology is arguably unparalleled and inarguably pragmatic. It brings a ton of value to offer the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  computational curious among us, and he's flat out a fantastic guy. So I invited him on the show. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=115.44s)]
*  Andrew, it's great to see you, and thanks for joining me. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=121.28s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much, man. Thanks for that great introduction. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=124.72s)]
*  Well, you know, we got to wind it up somehow. And I mean every word of it. Absolutely true. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=128.0s)]
*  I don't know, we've had two or three conversations now where, you know, I'm like, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=132.96s)]
*  hey, let's jump on the phone for 15 minutes, and 45 minutes later, we're waxing philosophic [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  about something really cool. So I welcome that. I love it. And I'm so thrilled that you're able [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  to join us today. And you got to pick a starting point, right? So I'm thinking about what's the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=147.68s)]
*  starting point with Andrew? And I want the starting point to be some of the colorful [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  backstory, you know, leading up to your professional vocations. Like, you're one [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=162.08s)]
*  of the smartest people, I think, that I have conversations with on a somewhat regular basis. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  But you got, you're doing smart things coming out of high school. You put college off for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=175.84s)]
*  quite some time. Like, you didn't even start studying this stuff for quite some time. So [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to ask you to rewind a bit and sort of give us the run up. Let's talk through the run up [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=184.72000000000003s)]
*  that led to, you know, what landed you in the position that you're in today? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=190.16s)]
*  Yeah, so I've been building or using technology for as long as I can remember since I was a kid. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=195.68s)]
*  For all sorts of like business problems or non-business problems, I started my [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  first business when I was 11. I didn't go to, as you mentioned, I didn't go to college out of high [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=209.6s)]
*  school because my mother got really sick when I was a kid. So I actually went to work to take care [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=216.8s)]
*  of her. But I've been developing technology for a wide variety of problems throughout my entire life [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  across industries. And so most notably, most recently relevant to what we're doing today is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  that help build some technology for an early stage biotech that was developing peptide-based drugs. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=233.52s)]
*  I helped them bring three peptide-based drugs from discovery to IND. And seeing the process [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=240.56s)]
*  of turning a molecule into something that you can inject into humans and all the failure that comes [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=247.44s)]
*  about thought that we could model some of these processes, actually how the company evolved was [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=251.68s)]
*  born. But I was an early user of the internet. I mean, early. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=259.6s)]
*  Yeah. Before you even went to college, you had started and sold a business, hadn't you? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I started a business in my early 20s. We were selling, I sold insurance online. So I had, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  at the time, no one, this was not, it was like the turn of millennia. So it wasn't like Geico [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  and Progressive selling insurance online today. But selling commercial insurance online. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=285.04s)]
*  I think we did three million dollars in revenue in my first year of the business, which is kind of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=289.04s)]
*  it was pretty big considering I was 22 at the time. And I actually had, I think of the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  100 clients, 100 or so clients, I had met five of them in person, which I don't know, at the time, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=308.56s)]
*  insurance was very sort of like a heavy touch industry. So, and then I sold that company a [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=313.84s)]
*  couple of years later because I was like, I didn't want to continue selling something that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=318.96s)]
*  nobody wants to use because who wants to use their insurance, right? Something bad happened [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=321.67999999999995s)]
*  if you had to use your insurance. So I sold it. So at what point did you decide you were going to go [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  to school? What did you study? And then how did that kind of transition into this interest in the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  intersection of health, healthcare and technology? So I was in my thirties before I got my, started [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=336.24s)]
*  on a bachelor's degree. I had done a, after selling my company, I had a successful career in music [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=344.24s)]
*  and toured like North and South America. And then I decided that I was like, okay, I've done this [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  for enough time that I got- Were you on stage or was your capacity technical? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=363.2s)]
*  No, I was a DJ. I was a very successful DJ. My mission in life is to bring happiness and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=371.04s)]
*  freedom to others. Was your stage name DJ Jazzy Satz? No? Oh, I thought that was pretty good. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=378.56s)]
*  No, that would have been, I didn't play hip hop. I played electronic music. But going back to the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=386.56s)]
*  idea that my mission in life is to bring healing and freedom to others. And so if you've danced [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=391.6s)]
*  before, you're not thinking about your problems when you're dancing. So that was kind of like [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=396.8s)]
*  the rationale. That was my rationale. My goal was just to make people happy. And I did that with [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=400.56s)]
*  music. I also did other things. I never do one thing at a time. So I was also working in the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=406.56s)]
*  insurance industry doing consulting. So less cool, less beat up version, less rich beat and less [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=412.24s)]
*  beat up version of Batman where I was doing one thing by day and one thing by night. And so I [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=420.48s)]
*  retired from that to go to school because I had done it successfully. I have a personal philosophy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=425.36s)]
*  People often say you only live once. I think you only die once and you can live as many lives as [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  you like. So I'm always trying to spend about five to 10 years doing something and then I'll do the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=437.04s)]
*  next thing. What's that next experience? So I retired from DJing to go study. I got into [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=444.24s)]
*  Columbia University, finished my undergrad at Columbia in philosophy and economics, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=451.2s)]
*  basically behavioral economics, because I was really interested in the theory of mind and how [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=456.32s)]
*  do people make decisions and how do you model that with the goal of studying data science, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=460.48s)]
*  which is basically the foundation for artificial intelligence. I have background in statistics. I've [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=467.76s)]
*  been looking at the problems of the application of AI, really researching the applications of AI [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=473.04s)]
*  for much of the time while I was in the insurance industry and while I was in the music industry. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  I saw how it was affecting these. You couldn't get more different than these two industries, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=485.92s)]
*  insurance and music. I saw how it was affecting both of these industries. I was like, oh, I have [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=490.32000000000005s)]
*  to learn more about this. So I just really was thinking about the applications. So how do you [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  apply it to problems? And so from 2006 to 2012, I was very much focused on the idea of people don't [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=500.88s)]
*  buy a drill, they buy a hole. So I was learning how the holes you can make with AI, where AI is the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=510.56s)]
*  drill. And then I realized I needed to learn how the drill works. That was part of the impetus for [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=514.64s)]
*  going back to going to school, get my degree, get my bachelor's and went on to get a master's degree [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=518.64s)]
*  in data science. And then at the end of that process, here I was graduating from a good [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=524.16s)]
*  university in New York City and didn't have any shortage of offers to work in tech or finance. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=534.64s)]
*  But if you look at most of the data science and tech, what are they doing? They're selling [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=543.28s)]
*  you more clicks. It's really, Google still makes nearly 90% of its money off of AdWords. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  And finance just didn't appeal to me to go work in finance. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=551.76s)]
*  Less than 5% of all data scientists at the time were in the entire healthcare ecosystem. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=557.6s)]
*  And that accounts for 20% of GDP. And so the question was, how do we apply [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  these types of technologies to solve problems in healthcare and medicine? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=569.84s)]
*  I had experienced the healthcare system as my mother had multiple sclerosis [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=573.84s)]
*  since I was a kid. And so observing how that affects, and because a lot of it affected from [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=580.24s)]
*  the neck up and the healthcare systems helped. So I was a consumer of the non-valuable outcomes [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=584.72s)]
*  of healthcare. And then in the insurance, I was on the other side of it where I was helping people [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  leverage the system. And then when we started a company, my co-founder and I started a company [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=600.32s)]
*  right out of grad school doing AI for healthcare consulting. And we did work for accountable care [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=606.56s)]
*  organizations. We did payers, providers. We got hired by a hospice to predict when patients would [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=610.4799999999999s)]
*  die, which was interesting. And then we got hired by a biotech to teach machines to read pet scans. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=616.4799999999999s)]
*  And that's actually ended up working with them on things not specifically related. And that was what [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=621.1199999999999s)]
*  led to the birth of the company we have today. Yeah. Yeah. That's the story I was looking for, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=626.4799999999999s)]
*  this fascinating story that's going to go all over the place and put you here. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=631.76s)]
*  So it doesn't make any sense why I'm... [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=639.04s)]
*  The more time I spend with you, the more perfect sense it makes. I mean, there was obviously that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=643.76s)]
*  inspiration with your mom's experience. And also, I mean, how much different is it being a DJ and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=648.08s)]
*  just wanting to make people happy from working in a space that's looking to cure and change lives [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=654.16s)]
*  and make people happy, right? I mean, maybe deep down the motive is the same. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=660.0s)]
*  Yeah. The motivation is the same, bringing healing and freedom to others. I think the only [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=665.52s)]
*  difference is like when I'm playing music, when I was playing music, the response was instantaneous. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=670.0s)]
*  Immediate. Yeah. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=676.0s)]
*  You've got to wait 15 years to see the response and it only works it right. And then you have all [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=676.8s)]
*  the... In the music industry, you also have lots of bad side effects, right? People go to the bars, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=682.64s)]
*  they're not just there to dance, they're also there to drink and celebrate life, some of which [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=689.12s)]
*  are not the best ways and some of them are good ways. And so you can kind of think of that as like [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=695.76s)]
*  the side effects of medication or like the... Yeah. Yeah. There are parallels there for sure. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=699.92s)]
*  So now you're in this position where you've got a pretty, like I said, a 360 degree view. I mean, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=708.32s)]
*  you've got a very unique perspective. You've got this very unique perspective from which you see a [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=712.64s)]
*  lot going on. And I think you're in a pretty good position to be able to sort of assess what you see [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=719.52s)]
*  happening in terms of adoption and acceptance and perhaps appetite for some of these tools in [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=724.72s)]
*  biopharma. So what do you see? So what I... I mean, well, it really depends on what stage [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=735.28s)]
*  you're talking about, right? Discovery, development, clinic, monitoring, sales and marketing. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=743.52s)]
*  Yeah. Let's talk discovery and clinic. Let's keep it early stage. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=754.0s)]
*  So on the discovery side, you have the two major medicines that really capture the significant [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=758.72s)]
*  portion of the sales. So you have small molecules and biologics. And within biologics, our focus [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=768.08s)]
*  that evolved is really around antibodies. So the real heavy application of AI first started in small [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=774.88s)]
*  molecules. Why? Because they're small. You have them 25 to 50 atoms. And if you think about [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  this from a mathematical perspective, each atom adds an exponential complexity to the possibility [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=788.88s)]
*  of the next atom. You have one atom and then you can... Where does the next atom sit relative to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=796.0s)]
*  the first one? And you have this sort of 360 perspective of where it could sit. And then [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=800.96s)]
*  you add the next one and that adds another layer of complexity. So what happened was, is that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=805.76s)]
*  you could actually use image-based analysis for these types of things. Because in 25 to 50 atoms, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=811.84s)]
*  you're getting to some level of complexity, mathematical complexity, which turns into [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=817.68s)]
*  computational complexity. That was tractable, especially with a lot of the advancements that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=822.0799999999999s)]
*  were happening in deep learning at the time, where you're having this pixel-based analysis [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=826.7199999999999s)]
*  and you can then translate into a voxel-based analysis. A voxel is just a pixel in three [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  dimensions. So how do you translate that? And you saw a lot of this actually impact in things [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=835.92s)]
*  like when people were doing AI for radio, so like CT or X-ray or PET scans or things like that, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=840.8s)]
*  because a lot of those are voxel-based. When you move to biologics, you're talking about things [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=851.68s)]
*  with 25 to 40,000 atoms. So you can't really solve the problem in the same way, because there's no [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=857.28s)]
*  computer on the planet that can do that, solve those problems. So you have to take different [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=862.64s)]
*  approaches. And if you look at what happened with AlphaFold, which is really doing protein [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=865.68s)]
*  structure prediction, they combined evolution, which is, that's part of the reason our company [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=870.8s)]
*  name is Evolve. They combined evolution with some structure-guided approaches so that they could [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  reduce the size of the problem. Evolution reduces the size of the problem. It's a way to say you [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=883.04s)]
*  can constrain the problem sets. It's not this infinitely large number or close to infinitely [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=888.16s)]
*  large number from a computational perspective. You can say, okay, it's constrained by what's [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=893.52s)]
*  observable in nature. And so that was really how you saw this bifurcation of this [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=898.56s)]
*  structure-based view in small molecules, which you can apply moving to more of an evolutionary, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=905.6s)]
*  which still contains structural views. And now you're starting to see language models [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=914.4s)]
*  being applied to that and diffusion models, which are other types of algorithms that can [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=918.56s)]
*  be applied to these problems. And so that's really on the design side of them. And then you have, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=921.84s)]
*  and that's just designing the molecule. How do you solve the problem of, that's like one [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=927.2s)]
*  third of the equation, right? You have the molecule itself, you have its target, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=932.72s)]
*  it's antigen, and then you have the level at which that interacts with the target. So then you have [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=936.32s)]
*  a sort of like a three-part problem, and that becomes very, very complex to predict. So the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  idea is like, how do you reduce that search space so you're not searching through billions or trillions [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=946.96s)]
*  of either molecules or, in our case, antibodies? So that's on the sort of the fundamental problems [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=951.6800000000001s)]
*  of just finding, in our case, an antibody that binds or a molecule that binds to your target. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=958.96s)]
*  And now you have to turn that into a drug. There's somebody on your podcast who said, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=964.6400000000001s)]
*  small molecules, hard to find a hit, easy to manufacture. Antibodies, easy to find a hit, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  hard to manufacture. And so you have this other issue of developability. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=976.24s)]
*  Yeah. How do you take that hit and turn it into a lead that can then be moved into things like CMC, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=980.08s)]
*  or you can do cell line development? How do you line that information up with the actual sequence [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=987.0400000000001s)]
*  itself? And then another interesting thing that I really think about the clinic side is, oftentimes [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=995.7600000000001s)]
*  you're not deciding that clinical approach till much later in the process, right? Once discovery [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1002.8800000000001s)]
*  is done and now you have a lead candidate and you're starting to do your [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1007.52s)]
*  IND enabling work, you're starting to design those clinical trials. What we're beginning to see [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1012.8s)]
*  in the early parts of it, and there are some really great companies doing some of this work, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1022.56s)]
*  and Silico Medicine is doing some of this work, right? Where they're starting to pick the patient [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1026.24s)]
*  cohorts as they're designing the molecule, which gets us a little bit closer to precision and a [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1031.12s)]
*  little bit closer to personalized medicine, right? Because typically we live in a panacea. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1038.32s)]
*  And then you have things like clinical trial design. You have the adaptive clinical trials, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1044.2399999999998s)]
*  which are Bayesian clinical trials rather than the traditional frequentist clinical trials. And those [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1049.76s)]
*  are very hard to design where you're going to run a lot of simulations and then you need compute to [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1054.9599999999998s)]
*  do that. Can you do patient stratification within clinical trial design? Can you use, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1060.8s)]
*  and oftentimes it's not even just AI, because AI is a buzzword, like patient identification. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1067.9199999999998s)]
*  Could you use things like social network information to start to identify patients [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1073.76s)]
*  that you wouldn't otherwise be able to identify from electronic health records? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1077.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1084.08s)]
*  Because they're not accurate. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1084.32s)]
*  Yeah. Now you're getting futurist on us. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I can take it. You can look at things like the first, there were a couple, a few years ago, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1089.68s)]
*  some of the first models to predict if someone has Alzheimer's were based upon vocal behavior, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1095.0400000000002s)]
*  which were trained on early, were changed on speeches from Ronald Reagan. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1100.72s)]
*  So that's, because you could actually see his, the neurodigital generation on him, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1105.6000000000001s)]
*  or you could hear it. And so could you use some of that information that you can pick up from [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  social media to say how people are writing differently or maybe how they're speaking [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1117.6s)]
*  differently. And that information is like everywhere, right? Everybody's making a YouTube [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1121.2s)]
*  video or recording a podcast. So could you start to predict that kind of stuff? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1125.44s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. I want to back up quickly though, to that sort of discovery and maybe early clinical [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1128.72s)]
*  application level and just get your perspective on what you see happening like in terms of the, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1138.1599999999999s)]
*  I guess company's adoption of it. Like, I mean, do you see a wholehearted embrace of these [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1146.0s)]
*  technologies? Do you see still some resistance? I guess just what is the, what's your take on [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1152.32s)]
*  the acceptance level? Yeah. I would say scientists are probably the second most skeptical group on [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1162.48s)]
*  the planet, maybe after doctors and parents of teenage children. Yeah. And so, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1167.04s)]
*  and it's healthy, right? That skepticism is healthy. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1173.04s)]
*  I think where the issue that comes about, especially as a technologist and speaking [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  to other technologists about this, is that scientists are not going to believe the [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1185.92s)]
*  computational models predictions. Yeah. They're, the rubber hits the road when it's in vitro, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  in vivo, in clinic, in market. Yeah. Right. And so that skepticism needs to be met with [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1200.56s)]
*  a degree of deference to the scientists themselves to understand that, you know, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1212.32s)]
*  99% of the experiments that they've run in their past have failed, right? That's the process of [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1219.28s)]
*  science. Yeah. And so we tend to, in technology, overhype the value of what's been created. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1225.92s)]
*  I'm as guilty of that as anyone, and I've learned over time as I engage with more and more scientists [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1233.3600000000001s)]
*  to continue to be skeptical about what we're observing from our own algorithms. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1240.24s)]
*  Yeah. But I think that the way to overcome that is to show some empirical data, right? Even if [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1244.3200000000002s)]
*  it's just giving you a small signal, because that little bit of change, if you can go from 99% of [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1250.32s)]
*  your experiments failing to 98% of your experiments failing, like that's a big jump. And if you think [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1257.6s)]
*  about it in terms of like the clinical side of things, like 90% of drugs fail, if you change that, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1263.6s)]
*  like 1%, think about the arbitrage value, right? That the change in the costs, like was it the new [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1268.56s)]
*  numbers are coming out right now, it's now $6 billion to develop a drug. Last year was $2 billion [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1276.24s)]
*  to develop a drug. Well, take 1% of that. Yeah. You see the sort of market difference, and that [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1281.28s)]
*  could have a lot of impact on the market as a whole. Yeah. Are you, I mean, are you seeing [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1287.36s)]
*  progress in terms of the ability of, you know, the computational champions to, and I say, I'm using [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1294.48s)]
*  computational, is that correct? Am I using computational sort of as the general catch-all [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1302.08s)]
*  term? I prefer that over AI. Yeah. You know, the next question, I'm going to finish out this [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1306.3999999999999s)]
*  question, then maybe we'll get into a couple of sort of definitions, like level set definitions. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1313.04s)]
*  But are you seeing the efforts of the computational champion to present that [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1319.1999999999998s)]
*  empirical evidence and illustrate the case happening? Is that happening? Like, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1326.32s)]
*  are we seeing progress in terms of that? We are seeing progress where we are seeing the sort of [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1333.76s)]
*  the computational link to the lab results. But like think how cheap it is to run an algorithm. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1340.48s)]
*  Right. Versus how expensive it is and time-consuming it is to run a lab experiment, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1348.8s)]
*  right? It's at least an order of magnitude difference. And like, you know, we can run our [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1354.96s)]
*  models in a couple of weeks, but the experiment can take, you know, four months. So our predictions [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1362.48s)]
*  are very fast, but the results from the lab take time. And that sort of difference in [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  philosophy and mindset, the sense of urgency, like you can't rush science. You can't make it [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1380.32s)]
*  go any faster. Just biology is going to move at biology speed. Over time, I think we'll start to [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1387.9199999999998s)]
*  see some changes, but it's not going to be like a zero to one change. It's going to be like a, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1393.04s)]
*  you know, 10 to 11 change, right? So I think that that's part of the challenge. And so you can get, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1397.04s)]
*  you can pump, and everyone's goal is to publish, publish, publish, publish, publish. You can publish [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1404.1599999999999s)]
*  a paper on your AI results or your machine learning results or your deep learning results [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1408.56s)]
*  or your transformer results very quickly while you need more time to get to the lab. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1411.84s)]
*  And there's not enough, there are not, the two groups are speaking very different languages. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1416.48s)]
*  We know that early stage biopharmers need support. Producing and scaling a biologic [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1424.08s)]
*  molecule is not easy. Companies with new or evolving programs need assistance every step of [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1428.64s)]
*  the way. Join us each week as we discuss all things Emerging Biotech, including regulatory, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1434.08s)]

*  You just rattled off, I said the next question, we'd do a level set on some definitions. You just [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1466.8s)]
*  rattled off a whole bunch of acronyms in the space. So let's take them one by one and just give us a, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1471.6s)]
*  you know, a quick, you know, fundamental definition and differentiation, right? Because I think that [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1475.76s)]
*  a lot of people kind of get muddled there. Differentiation like A-L or A-I-M-L, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1483.76s)]
*  computation all kind of falls into the same lump. Yeah, I mean, like computation is kind of like a [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1489.2s)]
*  calculator's doing computation, right? Like if you're adding two numbers, you're doing computation. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1495.2s)]
*  It's a general framework for like how you use computers, right? And computers is zeros and ones. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1502.16s)]
*  How do you turn two numbers into one number, right? The sort of like regression models and [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1508.64s)]
*  things like that. One of the, A-I is more of like a catch-all buzzword. And I really think that there [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1515.1200000000001s)]
*  are multiple kinds of A-I. I wrote about this in an article in Life Science Leader about the sort [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1522.64s)]
*  of five kinds of A-I. Yep. You remember what issue that was in? Oh, it was a couple of years ago I [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1527.68s)]
*  wrote that. Still relevant though? Oh, no, absolutely. So let me see if I can find it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1533.2s)]
*  Oh, you don't need to look it up. That's fine. You go to LifeScienceLeader.com, you'll find it. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1542.0s)]
*  Yeah. So there's, from my view, there was like five, there's five different kinds of A-I. And [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1545.52s)]
*  I'll give you a basic example. Like there's sort of, there's automation, automated intelligence, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1548.8s)]
*  right? And analytical intelligence. So automated intelligence would be a computer or machine doing [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1556.0s)]
*  something physical that you would otherwise do, right? And often people think about this in the [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1562.48s)]
*  terms of robotics, but if you get like a computer to do something that would take you a lot of time [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1571.52s)]
*  to do, it's also in that process, right? Like where you're reducing your physical labor. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1578.4s)]
*  Chad GBT is a good example of this, right? So you can write an entire paper, you can do that whole [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1583.04s)]
*  first version of it for you. So now analytical intelligence is where the computer is actually [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1591.04s)]
*  doing math for you, right? These are things that you could do in your head or on paper if you [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1596.08s)]
*  wanted to. So a calculator would be an example of like an analytical intelligence. And there are [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1601.84s)]
*  three other kinds of intelligence that I talk about, like accelerated intelligence, where you're [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1605.6s)]
*  predicting the future, or augmented intelligence, where kind of fusing all the different other types [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1609.84s)]
*  of intelligence into one space. I think the word artificial intelligence has really lost its meaning [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  because it's being used by all different types of people. Like my mother is talking, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1618.8s)]
*  or my dad asked me about artificial intelligence, and a six-year-old, and they're probably talking [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1625.52s)]
*  about two different, and me, we're all talking about three different things. I think one thing [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1630.0s)]
*  to point out is sort of like the difference between machine learning and deep learning. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1634.56s)]
*  But it's a key thing for people to understand. So I'm going to use an example to give a key. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1637.76s)]
*  Let's say you wanted to train a computer to recognize that there's a cat in a picture. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1646.4s)]
*  So what could you do? You could take the idea of saying, okay, well, I can pick out things that [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1652.72s)]
*  are features of cats, you know, pointy ears, fluffy tails- [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1658.0800000000002s)]
*  Whiskers. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1664.3200000000002s)]
*  Whiskers, upside down triangle nose, right? And those become features. So if I say like, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1665.2800000000002s)]
*  if an image contains these features in some percentage or probability, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1672.4s)]
*  then I can predict that that image contains a cat, right? By setting some set of features. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1678.48s)]
*  So oftentimes what we're doing, you know, happening in science, right? You're picking [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1686.16s)]
*  the experiments that you're going to run. That is a feature of that particular whatever you're [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1689.8400000000001s)]
*  testing it on, right? And these are oftentimes human designed features or human chosen features. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1695.28s)]
*  So this is basically how machine learning works. You pick a bunch of features, you [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1705.04s)]
*  have a bunch of variable, a target variable, in this case, a picture of a cat, and then you just [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1708.72s)]
*  give it a new picture of a cat. Give it a new picture, can I predict where there's a cat? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1713.84s)]
*  There's a completely different way of doing this, but has a similar process. You could just label [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1719.2s)]
*  images that contain cats, right? And a six year old could do that. Is there a cat in the picture? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1723.92s)]
*  Yes or no. And then you feed the computer the pictures of the cats. And then the computer using [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1729.2s)]
*  an analytical method, I'm not going to get into how it does it, but I'm happy to explain if you're [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1737.8400000000001s)]
*  curious, will then actually define the features. And the way that it does this is it will start [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1741.92s)]
*  by taking little pieces of the picture, four by four square of pixels, and go along the picture [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1748.08s)]
*  and say, okay, first it comes up with an edge, right? And then it comes up with a curve. And [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1755.36s)]
*  then those curves come together and make a shape. Then those shapes together make a whisker, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1762.0s)]
*  or whatever. And now the computer is able to say, give it a new picture, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1769.6s)]
*  is it have a cat? Now you need a lot of images. You needed a million images to train the first [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1773.9199999999998s)]
*  deep learning models to do just this. This is what the first on the first deep learning models would [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1781.6s)]
*  do. But in this case, the computer's defining what the features are. This becomes problematic, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1784.6399999999999s)]
*  though, if you're trying to predict pictures for, let's say, for example, CT scans, right? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1791.36s)]
*  The label CT scans, whether they have a tumor in them or not. Well, a six-year-old cannot do that. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1798.56s)]
*  You need a lot of training, a lot of education to do that. And so this comes into the big data [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1804.32s)]
*  problem of applying it to biology or to medicine, the lack of data, as opposed to the internet, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1811.04s)]
*  where there's just mass takes over. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and that data input, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1817.4399999999998s)]
*  that's a nice segue into some questions around data inputs, because I've had, as I said, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1824.48s)]
*  from the outset of the conversation, I've had a lot of conversations with companies who are applying [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1830.64s)]
*  machine learning in some capacity, specifically in drug discovery to date. And each of them [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1836.16s)]
*  seem to be working with a sort of a different data input philosophy, depending on the output [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1846.96s)]
*  they're looking for, the application they're looking for. I mean, obviously, when we get to [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1852.72s)]
*  the clinic, oftentimes the conversation revolves around bigger data in terms of population, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1856.32s)]
*  disease state, that kind of thing. But on the discovery side, it seems like there's a lot of [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1862.72s)]
*  there are different data inputs. So I want to get your take on that. And I know it's a highly [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1869.2s)]
*  variable answer, super variable response. But if I'm, let's say, a developer of antibodies [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1876.64s)]
*  in oncology, I'm focused on oncology, and I'm to date been sort of doing things, the traditional [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1886.4s)]
*  wet lab, academic translational science route, but I want to apply some machine learning tools. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1892.96s)]
*  Where do I start? In terms of data, where do I start? I mean, I can ask you that question on a [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1901.52s)]
*  couple levels in terms of data, in terms of application, in terms of technology. But [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1907.4399999999998s)]
*  how do I even know that if I have an application that will work and process my data, how do I know [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1912.7199999999998s)]
*  that I'm using the right data? I know that's a very... [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1918.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tough question to answer, right? Let's say, for example, let me zoom in a little [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1923.04s)]
*  bit. Let's say you're trying to develop a new PD-1 antibody. The world needs another PD-1 antibody [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1930.48s)]
*  for some reason. Let's say you're trying to develop a PD-1 antibody. Well, so there's actually a ton [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1937.44s)]
*  of data out there. You have how many? I don't know, 50 antibodies that are PD-1. So you know the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1944.32s)]
*  target. So you similarly... The way that I try to suggest to scientists to think about it is, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1956.56s)]
*  take what you're doing now and try to create some process or algorithm out of it. An algorithm is [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1964.6399999999999s)]
*  simply a process, right? But try to create an algorithm out of it, in your head or on paper, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1974.9599999999998s)]
*  or however you want to do it. And so in the case of, let's say, for example, a PD-1, well, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1982.0s)]
*  the first step would be, collect all the sequences of PD-1 antibodies. And it's a very... I'm going [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1987.52s)]
*  to give a very elementary example, right? You could do a multiple sequence alignment of those, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=1994.32s)]
*  right? And potentially build a model that understands the relationship between each [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2003.04s)]
*  amino acid sequence and all the other amino acid sequences in that multiple sequence alignment. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2010.96s)]
*  And you could start to potentially generate new antibody sequences. Now, whether they're [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2016.48s)]
*  patentable or not, that's not going to get into the IP question, but you can correct me based upon [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2021.76s)]
*  what's been observed of what's interacting. Now, there's some challenges around that because [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2027.6s)]
*  the CDRs and the frameworks act very differently. How do you do light chains and heavy chains [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2033.1999999999998s)]
*  separately as you start to run into these different problems? But at a very basic level, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2037.76s)]
*  this would be a way you could do that. There are lots of different other ways, right? Because [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2041.52s)]
*  the thing is, going back to what I was talking about earlier with the deep learning, right? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2048.16s)]
*  The computer is creating its own representation of what it means to be a cat. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2052.64s)]
*  Computers can also create their own representations of what it means to be a sequence, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2057.3599999999997s)]
*  right? We often think about, especially the structural biologists, if you take an amino [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2062.08s)]
*  acid sequence and you want to represent it in a three-dimensional space, you're going to create [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2067.8399999999997s)]
*  an XYZ coordinate plane of that three-dimensional structure. And to some extent, part of the reason [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2073.6s)]
*  we as humans do that is because we perceive the world in three dimensions or four dimensions, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2082.0s)]
*  if you want to count time. But computers aren't limited by that. They don't have this need to [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2087.68s)]
*  perceive. They don't have this need, right? So you can actually create a 1,000-dimensional space. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2093.28s)]
*  I don't know what 1,000 dimensions looks like. It doesn't make any sense to me what a 1,000-dimensional [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2101.2s)]
*  universe, I'm sure there are way more dimensions than three. I just don't know what it looks like. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2107.28s)]
*  But the computer is not limited by that. And so now you can create this representation that's not [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2112.16s)]
*  interpretable by humans, but is interpretable by a computer. And you can use that representation of [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2117.44s)]
*  now your PD-1 sequences to try to find something that matches that representation. So this idea [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2122.72s)]
*  means that you don't need necessarily big data to solve these problems. You just need to find a way [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2131.68s)]
*  to let the computer represent your sequences. You don't need to do the machine learning of [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2140.96s)]
*  labeling the cat images in your own way. You let the computer determine it through all these [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2144.88s)]
*  sort of statistical algorithms that are happening in the background. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2151.04s)]
*  In this, this may be a silly question, but I ask a lot of those. In this multi-dimensional [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2154.88s)]
*  computational environment that you describe, theoretically, it occurs to me that another [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2162.1600000000003s)]
*  reason for scientific skepticism might be that in a world like that with that many dimensions, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2169.6s)]
*  your output is going to be unbuildable. How big a problem is that? How big a problem is [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2175.68s)]
*  generating data that supports perhaps a molecular design and then finding that that might be [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2182.56s)]
*  doable in computational dimensions, but not in physical dimensions? Is that a thing? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2190.24s)]
*  This is a really, really good question. You ask a great question, not a silly question. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2197.84s)]
*  This is sort of like that second stage, which aligns very much into the idea of antibody [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2207.12s)]
*  discovery and antibody engineering. Just because I can discover an antibody using phase display or [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2212.96s)]
*  immunization that hits the target doesn't mean that I can make it at scale in a way that is [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2219.04s)]
*  economical and I can create a drug in a consistent way that allows me to get the FDA to [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2226.24s)]
*  approve my IND. It's a similar type of question. This is where the whole map, trying to figure out [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2233.3599999999997s)]
*  whether this antibody is developable and analyzing antibodies for developability. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2239.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of work happening on this. This is actually where a lot of effort is happening in the [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2245.68s)]
*  research space around developability because I can hand a sequence to a molecular biologist, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2250.72s)]
*  which is the output of our platform is a sequence. We don't sell software. We sell a sequence. We [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2256.0s)]
*  provide a sequence to people. If you're a molecular biologist, you can turn that sequence into [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2261.7599999999998s)]
*  something that can be generated by a cell as long as Golgi doesn't get clogged up because it doesn't [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2269.2s)]
*  work. It doesn't actually come out. There's our expression level problems. Yes, it is a big problem [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2279.92s)]
*  to know that just because the AI or the computer suggested it, is it actually makeable in a [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2287.36s)]
*  biological sense. The hypothesis is that because what you're training on has been observed and made, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2293.76s)]
*  that distinguishing feature will then carry into whatever you're generating. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2303.6s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily mean that that's always true because I don't know if you've used any [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2312.8s)]
*  of the stable diffusion type of products to make a picture and people show up with six fingers. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2316.48s)]
*  This actually is a function of the training data because a lot of it has to do with cartoon images. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2327.04s)]
*  Simpsons have four fingers. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2333.7599999999998s)]
*  Is computationally equipped to solve the problem it creates? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2340.8s)]
*  Is computationally equipped to solve the problem? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2346.16s)]
*  In the event that at the design stage, the output is something that is seemingly, to the human eye, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2349.7599999999998s)]
*  to the human mind, unbuildable, undevelopable, is there then an opportunity for machine learning [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2359.6s)]
*  to turn around and correct its mistake? Correct. I'm glad you said those two words together because [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2368.16s)]
*  it is not machine doing, it is machine learning. It becomes an iterative process where the computer [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2374.3199999999997s)]
*  can then be said, let's use expression level as an example. You take that sequence that the computer [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2380.3199999999997s)]
*  and output or sets of sequences the computer had generated, you make them and use expression level [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2388.4s)]
*  as a proxy for whether or not it can be made or not. You can feed that information back into the [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2394.88s)]
*  computer and the computer can learn from those expression levels so that its next iteration, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2400.7200000000003s)]
*  it will skew more towards those that had higher, that the features of those sequences that had [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2407.2000000000003s)]
*  higher expression levels and skew away from the ones that had lower expressions. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2413.44s)]
*  The interesting thing about this is that the computer can then do, you can actually do [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2420.56s)]
*  multi-parameter optimization. If you think about the traditional way you were designing, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2426.96s)]
*  discover and develop an antibody is you make your antigen, you run a campaign, either immunization [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2431.84s)]
*  or display, you pan your animal or some panning, you pan your library. Now you have a set of [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2439.84s)]
*  sequences that have risen to the top, you produce them recombinantly, then you check their expression [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2450.0s)]
*  levels, you check their binding, you check their function, you check their developability, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2455.6000000000004s)]
*  and you're doing this in a series of tests. The computer is actually not limited to that. It can [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2461.6800000000003s)]
*  actually test all of these things at once so that it's actually trying to predict what's going to, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2466.96s)]
*  because if you get to step 49 and it fails, you got to go all the way back, you got to go back some [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2471.28s)]
*  set of steps. The computer is trying to predict as much as possible. Every time a computer gets [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2476.96s)]
*  more information into itself, it can iterate on those. This goes back to your original question [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2482.16s)]
*  of where do you start with the data? Well, it depends on what problem you're trying to solve [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2488.7200000000003s)]
*  or sets of problems you're trying to solve. We're talking about an industry led by human beings who [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2493.6800000000003s)]
*  are uncommonly accepting of failure. You have to be in this business. It's the de facto standard. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2503.92s)]
*  And it sounds like the fail fast, fail cheap benefit of computational only exacerbates, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2512.88s)]
*  accelerates your rate of failure, but in a good way. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2523.36s)]
*  You think about just scientific publications as a whole. How many people are publishing on [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2529.36s)]
*  failed experiments? It's probably something less than 1%. You're not passing that learning [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2536.4s)]
*  on to other scientists. You're only passing your wins on to other scientists. In this case, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2548.8s)]
*  the computer actually gets value out of failed experiments and out of successful experiments, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2554.64s)]
*  as opposed to maybe that small group of scientists in the lab who get the value out of it. That [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2559.6800000000003s)]
*  learning can then generalize. That's where you really want to move into the generalized learning. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2565.2s)]
*  And going back to the idea of failing fast and failing quick and failing inexpensively. Now, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2571.4399999999996s)]
*  you'll lose out on some true positives at the expense of failures. But I think that in the end, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2576.64s)]
*  if we can get more drugs in the clinic, that's better for the population as a whole. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2585.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. You talk about, I mean, there's an interesting point you made around [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2591.12s)]
*  learning the machine's ability to learn from its failures and to aggregate failures and learn from [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2597.12s)]
*  that aggregation. I'm not sure how to phrase the question, but I'm curious about the play of [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2603.68s)]
*  proprietary IP and proprietary technology and even proprietary data in this sense. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2611.36s)]
*  Like the value in acceptance of publishing failure, publishing for the world's consumption [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2619.52s)]
*  is somewhat obvious. Don't repeat those failures. Learn from others' mistakes. End mass. And machines [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2630.32s)]
*  can do that. End mass. But is that allowed? To what degree is it allowed? Like for [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2638.8s)]
*  if I'm a drug developer and I'm using computational and last month I ran 14,000 iterations and [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2650.0s)]
*  14,000 of them failed, wouldn't that still just kind of live in a closet somewhere? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2657.84s)]
*  Oh, it's absolutely living in a closet. Yeah. But just as much as the success is, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2664.08s)]
*  that one success is also hiding in a closet as well. Those 13,999 failures and that one success, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2674.16s)]
*  they're all being held because of the nature of the industry. We often get this question, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2681.92s)]
*  doesn't my data help your algorithm and then doesn't that help my competitors? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2691.6s)]
*  Yeah. And so I'm a bit of an altruist. If you take the word competitor out and you just put in patient, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2695.6s)]
*  does that change your behavior? Does that change your thinking around that? But again, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2708.0s)]
*  I'm a bit of an altruist. And so it does stay hidden. But the really beautiful thing about [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2712.24s)]
*  the time that we're living in today is that the number one growing data set in the world is internet [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2721.2s)]
*  data. The number two growing data set in the world is financial data and the number three growing data [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2727.3599999999997s)]
*  set in the world, fastest growing data set in the world is biological data, primarily driven by [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2731.68s)]
*  sequencing. And the number of people who are now starting to come into the space from the technology [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2736.7999999999997s)]
*  side that can actually do something with that data. It's not growing at the same speed and it [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2749.12s)]
*  doesn't need to, but I find it to be very promising. And the cost of doing things like [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2754.16s)]
*  other types of data generation is going to go down where you're going to see it more [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2763.7599999999998s)]
*  widely distributed, like mass spec, the cost of mass spec is coming down. How much it costs [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2770.4s)]
*  coming down, right? How much it costs to sequence 10 years ago versus today. And so that [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2776.8s)]
*  creation of that data is actually going to, I think means that the data that's hidden is going [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2783.44s)]
*  to become less and less valuable over time. As that trend occurs, I want to get back to a point [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2788.0s)]
*  I made earlier when I was asking a very convoluted question about proprietary data and proprietary [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2796.2400000000002s)]
*  systems. In the earliest of conversations, a few years ago with biotech execs who were, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2802.0s)]
*  in some cases back then, founded on computational biology, like it was central to the [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2811.76s)]
*  formation of the company. We're seeing a ton of that now, but in the early days, it was sort of [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2817.44s)]
*  a rarity to have a conversation with someone who's like, yeah, we believe that we can discover and [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2822.08s)]
*  develop molecules using computational tools. Those tools were almost exclusively proprietary. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2826.72s)]
*  These companies, they adopted technology coming out of an academic lab, or they perhaps hired [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2835.6s)]
*  programmers and developers and spun the technology up themselves. Does that remain the case? What's [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2842.16s)]
*  the forecast for the commercial market of applications that are, I mean, you say plug [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2851.28s)]
*  and play, but to whatever degree, plug and play, like off the shelf software applications that [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2860.88s)]
*  bio-pharma companies can plug in, put their data in, and start to play in this realm? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2869.6800000000003s)]
*  There are quite a few companies doing that, and businesses doing that. I think one of the things [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2876.32s)]
*  that's interesting though is that unlike the biotech space, where your patents are really [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2881.6800000000003s)]
*  core to what you're doing, the software space is completely opposite. Everything's open source. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2888.96s)]
*  So that's a little bit of a different mentality. It goes back to the difference between scientists [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2896.4s)]
*  and engineers and how they think about the world. So there are software platforms that can help you [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2901.04s)]
*  analyze your data. Those are there. You look at, in the antibody realm, there's a company called [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2908.56s)]
*  PipeBio that does this. It does a really good job. They're like a bioinformatics for biologics. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2922.08s)]
*  I think that the proprietary algorithms are less and less likely to be of value because the speed [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2931.52s)]
*  of research is going to outpace the protections that you can keep internally. And once you patent [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2940.72s)]
*  your algorithm, you've basically given it away. It's not like a molecule where you can actually [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2949.68s)]
*  test whether somebody's made it. You can't see underneath someone's hood, and they can make some [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2958.08s)]
*  minor modifications, and then your patent is useless. And so there's far less patenting in [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2963.44s)]
*  the software space. So what's really important is to actually think about the output, that medicine. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2970.7999999999997s)]
*  AI is a tool. It's not a property thing. But the molecules that it generates are. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2977.68s)]
*  What you develop, because that has utility. That is real utility. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2991.2s)]
*  That's what you're asking about. If that's what you were asking about. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=2998.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but that last statement you just made resonated, but it sounds controversial. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3002.7200000000003s)]
*  You said there's a whole cottage industry or several players in the software space [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3012.56s)]
*  who are coming to bear with applications. I think they'd probably argue that last point [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3017.1200000000003s)]
*  you made, wouldn't they? That this is property. Did I miss something there? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3022.32s)]
*  Yeah. I probably wasn't completely clear on that. So what I meant was- [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3032.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. Or I didn't completely understand. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3036.56s)]
*  If I wanted to write an algorithm on two plus three, and I patented an algorithm on two plus [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3039.36s)]
*  three, well, somebody else could just go ahead and do an algorithm on one plus four, or two plus [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3046.64s)]
*  two plus one. And so what I mean by that is once you patent it, the ability to work around it [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3052.3199999999997s)]
*  is actually pretty algorithmically, it's fairly trivial. Now, just because you can design an [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3059.2799999999997s)]
*  algorithm doesn't mean, number one, that you can make it work at scale. There's lots of [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3069.3599999999997s)]
*  amazing research coming out of universities of these algorithms that can do these things, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3076.7999999999997s)]
*  but to put them into production, very, very complicated. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3081.04s)]
*  That's one side of it. And the other side is, can you even make money off of it? Is there a [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3087.68s)]
*  business out of it? And so what good companies are doing is they're stringing together [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3091.52s)]
*  technology in very unique and innovative ways. And that's where the value comes into play. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3098.16s)]
*  An antibody on itself is not going to solve your problem. You have to be able to make a formulation [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3108.16s)]
*  out of it. You have to have a cell line that you can standardize out of it. You have to figure out [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3115.6s)]
*  the patient cohorts that can go after. It doesn't actually have a lot of value until you- I mean, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3120.7999999999997s)]
*  unless you're biotech, right? It doesn't have value to the patient until it gets to market. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3126.48s)]
*  And so just because I have an algorithm doesn't mean that it has value. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3131.84s)]
*  Values met when you hit the market. And so what I meant by the property side of things is just [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3138.8s)]
*  because you can patent an algorithm doesn't mean that somebody can't come along and do some new [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3143.6s)]
*  version of it. Chad GPT is a very, very, very good example of this. The T in Chad GPT stands [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3148.88s)]
*  for transformer. That was a model that was first presented by Google in 2017. Google. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3156.32s)]
*  Google introduced the transformer. Chad GPT is open to open AI is not owned by Google, right? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3167.2000000000003s)]
*  And so they found another way to leverage that really powerful algorithm to turn it into a [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3173.52s)]
*  business. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, thanks. Thanks for that clarification. And I know [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3178.4s)]
*  that we're running a little bit short on time. So you got time for like one more and then we'll- [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3184.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to ask you one more question on something [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3190.48s)]
*  that I've been wanting to get your take on. And then we're going to get back together again for [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3193.5200000000004s)]
*  another episode where we maybe zero- we'll take a poll of the hottest question area in terms of [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3198.2400000000002s)]
*  computational among our audience members. And that's where we'll focus. We'll have a more [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3206.8s)]
*  focused discussion next time. This has been very comprehensive and enlightening. But you mentioned [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3210.88s)]
*  just a minute ago, you talked about like the challenge of marrying scientists and engineers. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3216.96s)]
*  And that's another common refrain among companies who are adopting computational tools and biopharma. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3222.8s)]
*  Very common refrain. I could cite a half a dozen execs who have said, science is easy, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3229.2000000000003s)]
*  technology is easy, marrying humans, you know, one group who is brought up in the wet lab and [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3236.08s)]
*  one group who is brought up in the IT lab and making- getting them to work together effectively [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3243.12s)]
*  and efficiently in the same building is more challenging than science and technology. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3248.96s)]
*  What do you think of that? There's a great quote from Michael Pollan and he said, it goes something [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3254.56s)]
*  like this, that the key difference between understanding the difference between scientists [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3262.0s)]
*  and engineers is how they actually solve problems. Scientists in general solve problems by [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3266.16s)]
*  controlling everything and reducing something to its smallest point and then measuring that one thing. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3272.4s)]
*  But engineers are dealing with- are trying to deal with irreducible complexity. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3278.16s)]
*  So like simple examples like duct tape. For an engineer, if the duct tape works, who cares? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3283.28s)]
*  It works, right? Right? For scientists, they're going to want to know like all the different [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3289.92s)]
*  things about the polymer and like the right- the thermodynamics. So what you have as a result of [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3293.6s)]
*  this is groups of people who speak completely different languages and approach problems in very [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3298.8s)]
*  different ways, which is really, really good. It's a really good thing because it provides diversity. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3303.44s)]
*  The valuable teams have a translator in the middle who speak both. Someone who speaks both biology [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3309.36s)]
*  and technology. That sounds like a rare breed. It is a very rare individual. There are probably [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3317.84s)]
*  a thousand of them on the planet, but there are going to be more of them in the future. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3322.72s)]
*  And one way to sort of accelerate that process is for, you know, take a month, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3328.24s)]
*  put your technologist in the wet lab. For a month, teach your biologist how to code, right? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3335.84s)]
*  They will then, you know, like it's like when you go to a new country, you don't need to speak, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3343.36s)]
*  I don't need to speak Italian perfectly. I just need to know to ask how to order a beverage and [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3347.6s)]
*  where the bathroom is. That will get me over the edge and will make people in the country of which [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3352.88s)]
*  I'm going to more receptive to me. If I'm willing to sort of like push along the edge. Parisians [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3358.7999999999997s)]
*  are a great example of that. If I ask Parisians like where's the nearest cafe, as opposed to even [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3365.84s)]
*  trying to speak a little bit of French, the difference is night and day. So I think that [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3371.36s)]
*  that's part of the way to sort of overcome this with just a little bit of training. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3376.48s)]
*  Yeah. Both sides on what, like how their problems are. There's a lot of hand waving and like, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3381.1200000000003s)]
*  oh, you're just doing some compute, right? Like, oh, you're just, you know, you know, using a pipette. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3386.1600000000003s)]
*  It's not that trivial, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I applaud that. That was a big question to [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3392.7200000000003s)]
*  ask you in our waning moments of our recording together. I'm sure there's a lot more to go on [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3398.48s)]
*  there, but you know what? We'll do it. We'll have you back. Matter of fact, I'll throw a poll out [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3403.12s)]
*  there right now. Audience, if you want more Andrew Sats, you send me an email and let me know. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3407.28s)]
*  We'll get more of it. I don't know that anybody wants to hear anymore from me. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3414.08s)]
*  No, there's so much more to hear. Like I had so many more questions for you, but I know we both [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3417.52s)]
*  need to get running and I don't want to hold our audience hostage for too long. So part two and [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3421.92s)]
*  beyond TBD, but I appreciate you hanging with my sometimes, you know, they're neophyte questions, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3428.4s)]
*  but this is an, this is an arena where I think a lot of people are coming into it, going like [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3434.2400000000002s)]
*  asking the same questions I'm asking, right? Like if we don't have a, it's not something that you [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3439.28s)]
*  get your mind around too easily until we dig into the details and you're very valuable for that. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3444.88s)]
*  Yeah. And I appreciate that. And I'm, and I'm happy to share, you know, like I think that [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3449.92s)]
*  there's a lot of value that can be leveraged here that to really transform our sick care system into [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3454.72s)]
*  a true healthcare system. Right. And, you know, we have, it's going to be incremental or it's [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3460.3199999999997s)]
*  going to be zero to one, some, some place we have to start to make some zero to one changes. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3466.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And so how do we do that? Yeah. Yeah. Well, like I said, I mean, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3471.52s)]
*  there's a giant continuum of topics to talk about in terms of application of these technologies and [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3477.8399999999997s)]
*  healthcare space. And I look forward to doing that with you. And I appreciate the intellect that you, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3484.0s)]
*  every time we talk, you, a little bit rubs off on me and I appreciate that. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3489.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. I, I'm, I'm grateful to be here and I feel, I feel very, I feel the same, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3493.5200000000004s)]
*  right? I absolutely enjoy our interactions. They're, they're fantastic. And, and I'm honored to be [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8sGojK7NRY&t=3498.4s)]
