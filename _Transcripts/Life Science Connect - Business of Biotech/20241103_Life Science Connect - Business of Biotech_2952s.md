Video Description: Becoming a biotech CEO wasn't on Paul Romness' bingo card. He'd forged his place in the biopharma industry as a foremost public and policy affairs expert. Thirteen years at J&J, more than 5 at Amgen, and half a dozen at Boehringer Ingelheim had earned him the right to coast into a consulting gig that would enable him to finish out his career on his terms. 
Then his daughter's best friend Olivia, a teenage girl and neighbor he'd watched grow up, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma. 
The ensuing journey, now in its seventh year, put Romness in the position of CEO and Chair of OS Therapies. It's a company formed through a combination of circumstance, determination, and ingenuity that's now shepherding its HER2 and tunable ADC therapeutics through mid-late-stage clinical trials. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, we dig into the building blocks of an unanticipated biotech startup. We'll learn how Romness leaned into his personal and professional communities to build a company that's now addressing unmet patient need in osteosarcoma and cancers of the breast, esophagus, lung, and pancreas. And we'll get an update on Olivia, who's now in med school at Columbia University and serving on the OS Therapies Board of Directors.

# An Unanticipated Biotech Startup With OS Therapies' Paul Romness
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU)
*  While Paul Romness played a hand in quite a few therapeutic wins over the course of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=0.0s)]
*  his 25 years in Big Bio, and while he exited Big Bio 10 years ago to scratch an entrepreneurial [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=9.56s)]
*  itch, it's unlikely to have crossed his mind at the time that 10 years later he'd be scratching [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=16.4s)]
*  that itch via leadership of a clinical stage biotech developing vaccines and antibody drug [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=23.26s)]
*  conjugates for cancer patients. It's unlikely because Paul is a Big Bio government affairs [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=28.44s)]
*  and public policy guy, and when he left Big Pharma to run his own business, that business [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=35.68s)]
*  was a consultancy that fit squarely in the wheelhouse of his expertise. But just a couple [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  years into that endeavor, life threw a curveball that inspired the launch of OS therapies. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=47.24s)]
*  The business of biotech Paul now leads as chairman and CEO. I'm Matt Piller. This is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=53.44s)]
*  the business of biotech, and on today's show we're getting to know Paul Romness, sharing [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=58.96s)]
*  the inspirational story of OS therapies launch and learning how that inspiration has fueled [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=63.64s)]
*  the small but mighty company's ongoing success. Paul, welcome to the show. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=70.24s)]
*  Thank you so much, Matt. What a thoughtful intro. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=75.28s)]
*  I appreciate that. The thoughts were all correct. I got that right? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=78.16000000000001s)]
*  All right. Good deal. Definitely wasn't looking for osteosarcoma. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  I didn't think so, although we're going to get into the story and it's kind of a neat story, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  given your long history with osteosarcoma prior to dedicating effectively your entire [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=93.68s)]
*  professional life to it. We'll get into those details here in just a bit, but I just want to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=100.56s)]
*  let you know that I'm super excited to have you on the show. Paul and I had the chance to talk [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=107.36s)]
*  a few weeks ago and after hearing about the work that he's doing and why, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=111.76s)]
*  as a no-brainer, I had to get Paul on the show. So thanks for being here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=116.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=119.36s)]
*  So you get your start years back. We're going to rewind the clock way back. You get your start [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=120.8s)]
*  in life sciences as a salesman, as a lot of execs often do. You started selling orthopedic [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=126.0s)]
*  devices for J&J. That kind of served as your springboard into a career in government relations [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=134.56s)]
*  and policy leadership. That career spanned companies like J&J, Amgen, Bering, or Engelheim. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=141.12s)]
*  We'll revisit those years as we talk because I want to learn how they kind of informed [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=148.88s)]
*  your career, but I don't want to start there. I want to start with the personal and professional [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=155.44s)]
*  inflection point that came much later in around 2017 in the form of a young woman named Olivia [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=163.04s)]
*  Egge. So rather than fill in the blanks, I'm going to ask you to start there. Tell us her story and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=171.76s)]
*  tell us how it inspired yours. I feel like that movie with Cuba Gooding Jr. not going to make me [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=177.84s)]
*  cry, man. I don't know. It's a very impressive story. Olivia was diagnosed with osteosarcoma [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=185.68s)]
*  in February of 2017. She lives about two doors from us. She's my daughter's best friend. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=200.24s)]
*  And I like to tell the end of the story and take away a little suspense because Olivia's doing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=208.4s)]
*  great. Even though she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, very deadly bone cancer, she is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=214.96s)]
*  seven years cancer free and she sits on the board of directors of our now publicly traded company. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  She and my daughter both graduated from the University of Virginia last May and she's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  since taken her MCATs and her MCATs are really good. And so she will be going to medical school [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=241.12s)]
*  next year. That's amazing. But unfortunately, through our journey, and before we started [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=246.48s)]
*  OS therapies, we started OS collaborative, oscollaborative.org to really change the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  trajectory of osteosarcoma. And Olivia's father and I helped start the nonprofit. We started [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  shaving our heads to raise money for St. Baldrick's and other than Olivia's dad and me, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=274.96s)]
*  all the parents involved in all of the nonprofits around osteosarcoma. And turns out most [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=281.76s)]
*  childhood diseases have lost their child to the disease. And so that's been a real inspiration [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  for us. And then, with some of the money that we raised from the nonprofit, we brought in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  KOLs from across the country and really wanted them to start pushing genetic testing [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=304.4s)]
*  because standard of care and osteosarcoma was a good five years behind any other cancer. They just [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  had no idea what the genetic makeup of the cancers were. And at that meeting, Dr. Richard Guralak [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=318.72s)]
*  of MD Anderson put up a slide about the most promising new technologies. And our future [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=326.0s)]
*  technology was up there. I had happened to read about it about a week before the meeting. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=331.36s)]
*  And so that was first checked that we were kind of going the right direction. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=337.12s)]
*  And then the next day I emailed eight of these really, really busy, probably the busiest people [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=340.8s)]
*  in the world, right? Because they're treating kids, they're researching and they're flying [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=346.16s)]
*  around the world trying to make a difference in this really bad disease. And I emailed eight of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=352.72s)]
*  them the next morning. I said, we're going to start a company. We're going to license that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=358.0s)]
*  canine osteosarcoma. I used to call it the dog treatment because dogs get osteosarcoma a lot [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=362.56s)]
*  more than humans. I said, we're going to start a company. We're going to license that technology. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=371.68s)]
*  Will you be on our scientific advisory board? All eight of them emailed me back that day. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=376.56s)]
*  That day. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=383.2s)]
*  That day. And that was check number two. We're going the right direction. I might not be the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=384.48s)]
*  brightest, but when these signs are given to me, it's pretty obvious we're going in the right [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=389.6s)]
*  direction. So the next month I met with the company that was out licensing the technology. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=395.76s)]
*  They had in licensed it from the University of Pennsylvania. I met Dr. Robert Pettit across the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=402.32s)]
*  table. He was as passionate about this technology as I was about the disease. He's now our chief [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=408.48s)]
*  medical and scientific officer. And it's great to have the founding scientist for not only that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=417.52s)]
*  platform technology, the HER2 technology, but also our ADC technology. We have the founding [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=423.28s)]
*  scientists on our team for that as well. So really vast amount of resources in these founders. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=428.4s)]
*  And six months, eight months later, we didn't license the technology. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=438.08s)]
*  About two years on March 15th, 2020, the beginning of COVID, we started our weekly clinical trials [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=443.67999999999995s)]
*  call. We still do that every Monday. And then on October 21st, 2021, we put our first kid [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  in the trial. Four weeks ago yesterday, the last kid got his last dose. So 41 kids have been in [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=457.28s)]
*  our trial and we expect the readout on the data the week after Thanksgiving. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, so that's an incredible story. And there are a whole bunch of details [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  in there that I want to dig out a little bit. I mean, you find yourself, like I said, your career [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=477.52s)]
*  to this point has been quite successful. You've made a name for yourself in government and public [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=483.68s)]
*  policy affairs in BigBio. A wise and probably well-planned move into consultancy after doing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=488.0s)]
*  that for 25 years. Setting yourself up for a likely, a good business, a good probably lifestyle [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=498.4s)]
*  business that's going to serve you well. And then this comes along, this experience comes along, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=506.88s)]
*  Olivia comes along and you feel motivated to do something. Tell us about your preparedness to do [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=514.08s)]
*  that thing or lack thereof, if you don't mind. Sharing a little bit about how you, before we [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=523.76s)]
*  even get into where's the money going to come from? How am I going to get the experts that I need? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=533.36s)]
*  How did you reconcile in your mind? All right, I'm going to grab, you know, I'm going to have [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=538.48s)]
*  to grab the shifter and make a shift here. How did you wrap your mind around this? Like I'm going to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=543.92s)]
*  go do this. We're going to go do this. Well, Matt, I've said a couple of times, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=549.76s)]
*  startups are no country for old men. But it reminds me, Bernie Marcus and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=555.44s)]
*  Ken Langone didn't start Home Depot until they were 55. And I think it is the experience and the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=563.84s)]
*  past, the network, the hard knocks, the challenges, the inspiration of great leaders that I've had in [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=571.28s)]
*  the past that prepared me. I certainly wasn't looking for it. You know, when I started my [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=580.72s)]
*  career selling orthopedic implants and then transferring over to the biotech division of J&J, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=587.12s)]
*  I met a great network of people and I often say there's only one thing I know about getting [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=594.0s)]
*  old that's good, and that's watching your friends do well. You know, the folks that I worked with [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=601.2s)]
*  at OrthoBioTech and Johnson & Johnson and at Behringer Ingelheim and Amgen have spread across [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  the entire industry and are running the industry. And so it's those friends and co-workers that we'll [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  look to as we develop our platform technologies to partner with them, because I think we do have [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=619.76s)]
*  a lot to offer with both our platforms to BigBioTech, Big Pharma. With HER2, we really believe that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=626.72s)]
*  adding our cancer-killing vaccine to Herceptin or Tertuzumab, we can increase the effectiveness of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=634.96s)]
*  Herceptin or Tertuzumab, but we also prevent patients from getting resistance to that therapy [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=647.12s)]
*  because Tertuzumab keeps the cancer down, our vaccine comes in underneath and kills it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=653.52s)]
*  And then on the ADC technology, our special sauce is we're wrapping the payloads with silicone, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=661.36s)]
*  which, and then attaching the payloads, multiple payloads to the ADC with silicone. The beauty of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=667.76s)]
*  silicone is it doesn't get broken down by the proteins, it gets broken down by pH levels. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=673.52s)]
*  It turns out cancer has a higher pH level. All of this came from different experiences through my [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=678.16s)]
*  career, starting with orthopedic implants, seeing patients get their, Walter Reed Army Medical Center [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=684.56s)]
*  was the global military center for kids of military personnel that had osteosarcoma. So we had kids [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=692.0s)]
*  flying in from all over the world, Japan, Germany, Spain, London, or England, different places [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=701.84s)]
*  around the world that are military-based and these kids were getting treated. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=712.0s)]
*  For osteosarcoma, Walter Reed, Dr. Bill Hopkinson, who is now at Loyola, I believe, Dr. Tom Temple, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=716.48s)]
*  who's down at Florida Atlantic, they are the, some of the pioneers of limb salvage. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=724.24s)]
*  So a lot of these kids can keep their limbs when they get osteosarcoma in their long bones. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=732.96s)]
*  So that was a great experience watching leaders like that. And then being at Johnson & Johnson, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=740.24s)]
*  they were the ones that inspired me to go back to graduate school and paid for my [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=745.28s)]
*  Masters of Health Policy. It was Amgen that gave me the opportunity to really use that degree. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=751.12s)]
*  And my biggest goal in the entire industry, Matt, was to someday run a Washington office [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=757.44s)]
*  for the bio-pharmaceutical industry. And I got the opportunity to run government affairs [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=764.08s)]
*  for Baron Eringo Hyman. After that, one really dangerous thing I think about being a good leader [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=768.96s)]
*  is not having a goal. And so I'd hit my goal and I didn't know what else there was. I had been [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=777.84s)]
*  inspired by great CEOs at Johnson & Johnson and at Baron Eringo Hyman with Marty Carroll and Paul [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=786.96s)]
*  Fontaine. But I never really envisioned doing that. As a friend of mine who worked at NASDAQ said to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=796.4s)]
*  me, did you ever think you'd take a company public? And I said, absolutely not. And so [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=805.36s)]
*  after BI, one of our co-workers from J&J and Baron Eringo Hyman and a friend of mine from [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=812.72s)]
*  MedImmune AstraZeneca got together and said, we should really look to start a company to take [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=820.4s)]
*  you know, phase two, phase three assets that aren't big enough for big pharma, big biome, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  take them off the shelf, reanalyze them with new data analytics, and then see if we can, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=833.28s)]
*  you know, make a go of products like that. And we had a couple, you know, we were all busy at the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=840.64s)]
*  time so it ended up not happening. But when Olivia got sick, that's, I knew what we had to do because [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  the survival rate, if it came back to her lungs or her brain, if it metastasized, like any other [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=855.12s)]
*  cancer, when it metastasizes, is when you drop the survival from pretty good to horrible, right, in [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=861.12s)]
*  case eight to 13%. And so I knew we had to do something about that. And that's when I read in [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=870.08s)]
*  pink sheets that this company was giving up this asset from University of Pennsylvania. And I knew [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=876.64s)]
*  why they were giving it up. It was only a thousand patients a year. Yeah. You know, the incidence [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=881.52s)]
*  rate. And that's when, you know, the idea of taking something off the shelf and getting it [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=885.92s)]
*  through the FDA. And so it was phase two be ready. We in licensed it. And we now have the rights to [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=893.28s)]
*  that. And we finished the clinical trial and we'll be submitting to the FDA here in the next few [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=902.64s)]
*  months. And I'm very confident that at least a conditional approval is on the horizon, short [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=910.4s)]
*  horizon for us through the event free survival data. But then once they see the overall survival, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=918.64s)]
*  I think we'll be able to get to full approval. But either way, as you know, the priority review [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=926.4s)]
*  vouchers, that could really help a company like us. And it falls back to my old job, right? Public [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=932.56s)]
*  policy and government affairs in that the intended consequences of the priority review voucher were [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=940.8s)]
*  to get companies like ours to seek commercialization of products for rare and pediatric diseases. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=947.5999999999999s)]
*  That's what we're doing. And by giving us a transferable voucher that we can sell to big pharma, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=955.1199999999999s)]
*  so that they can cut in line by four months is just a great win win. One, we're getting new [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=962.7199999999999s)]
*  commercial products out to for rare and pediatric diseases. And, you know, big bio, big pharma, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  that's in line for months. It's kind of like clear or global access. And they get on the market four [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=977.68s)]
*  months sooner, which people always think, oh, you know, it's four months, four more months of sales. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  Yes, it's four more months of sales. It's also four more months ahead of your competition. But [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=988.8s)]
*  it's also the biggest thing is four more months of growing your forecast. And if you extrapolate that [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=993.76s)]
*  out to three, five, seven years, your forecast is even larger because of those extra four months on [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1000.9599999999999s)]
*  the front end. Yeah. So, you know, the all of my worlds and all of my experience and all of the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1008.4s)]
*  great people that I've worked with in the industry for a long time. And, you know, frankly, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1017.2800000000001s)]
*  some of the board leaders that I worked with, you learn from them as well. And you hope you [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1022.6400000000001s)]
*  don't repeat their mistakes. Yeah. Yeah. In retrospect, looking back on it, what would you [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1028.24s)]
*  say gave you the most pause at the time? You know, when you fired off those emails and said, hey, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1036.24s)]
*  we're going to get this thing and we're going to start a company, was there a particular spot [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1043.04s)]
*  that you were like, yeah, that's maybe my weak spot, maybe my blind spot? Like, was there anything [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  that gave you pause about making that move? Actually, absolutely not. Because it seemed like [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  all of the messages, all of the signs were going in the right direction. And when I started to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  reach out to friends and family, hey, I'm going to start this company. You know, they were willing [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1069.52s)]
*  to stand up and fund the company. There were some tight times, you know, it's been written [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1076.32s)]
*  that, you know, my college, my daughter's college funds were put into this company. They were my, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1083.44s)]
*  my, my retirement was put into this company. And, you know, obviously my wife and I had [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1089.36s)]
*  conversations about that, but we strongly believe that doing good often will often will always lead [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1095.36s)]
*  to do doing well. And so I think, you know, I've never met, I've never taken a job for the money [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  and I hope I never did. But it's getting things done that need to be done. I truly buy into the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1113.6s)]
*  whole Jane J. Pareto and that it's patients first, right? And it's caregiver second, it's community [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1125.2s)]
*  third, and it's the shareholders fourth. And if the first three are taken care of, then the fourth [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1132.88s)]
*  will be taken care of. And you talk about beginning a career back in the career, having started with [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1140.64s)]
*  Jane J. We just recently moved into the Johnson and Johnson J labs because of the opportunity [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1148.08s)]
*  to be in that incubator. And it turns out they don't let you into J labs with, unless they are [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1157.04s)]
*  interested in your technology. So our ADC technology, as someone said, big pharma, big bio is only [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1164.24s)]
*  interested if you have wickedly crazy new science. I don't think that's crazy. We're just [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1173.12s)]
*  wrapping the payloads and connecting them to the ADC with silicon dioxide. Or if it gets them out [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  of a bind. And as you know, with ADC, the weak link are the linkers. And so if we can help big [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1187.1999999999998s)]
*  pharma with the linkers, we may get through some toxicology trials. But once we get through that, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1195.6799999999998s)]
*  I think we'll be a huge out licensing opportunity machine for the company. But also we're wrapping [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1201.2s)]
*  the payloads and think of cytotoxins or even monoclonal antibodies or mRNA, being able to [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1208.88s)]
*  protect that payload until it gets into the cancer environment or into whatever disease [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1215.3600000000001s)]
*  state environment we're targeting. And then that coding being eaten off by the low pH, high acidity [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1221.28s)]
*  will really make the ADCs a much more successful and large part of the pharma community. I think [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1228.32s)]
*  ABVY came out during ASCO this year that they believe that ADCs will replace all chemotherapy [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1239.36s)]
*  and cancer and certainly our delivery system by keeping the chemotherapy, the cytotoxins [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1247.04s)]
*  inactive until they get into the cancer environment will be a part of that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1255.68s)]
*  Yeah. Before you began developing the ADC program, I mean, before you even expanded [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1259.5200000000002s)]
*  the original product beyond osteosarcoma, you had mentioned that, yeah, you knew why BigBio wasn't [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1268.24s)]
*  necessarily interested in it because it was a small patient population. How did you like, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1275.2800000000002s)]
*  when you were getting the company off the ground and it was like, we're going to go tackle [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1280.8000000000002s)]
*  osteosarcoma with this product, how did you reconcile that risk, that product [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1284.0s)]
*  patient population calculation? Well, I think it was twofold really. One, we saw that [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1291.2s)]
*  RLST HER2 was preventing metastasis in osteosarcoma and in the dogs. And as we talked about earlier, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1301.76s)]
*  the dogs get osteosarcoma, 30,000 to 40,000 dogs a year in the United States, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1312.64s)]
*  as opposed to only a thousand kids a year, 20,000 kids globally. So we saw that it was preventing [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1318.48s)]
*  metastasis. And even though it's only half the patients that metastasize, you really don't know [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1324.8000000000002s)]
*  which patients going to metastasize. So we didn't see the entire market in the U.S. as 500. We saw [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1329.92s)]
*  it as a thousand and we saw the global market, not as 10,000 patients, but 20,000 patients. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1336.64s)]
*  And we've done this. We've done everything with our phase two B trial with in licensing, both [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1342.32s)]
*  technologies, with advancing both technologies, done all this, even post IPO with $25 million. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1350.48s)]
*  Most companies would have spent 120, 150, 250, 250 million. And so we've been very cost effective. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1358.32s)]
*  And we see just with the osteosarcoma indication, a potential market of 400 to [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1367.1200000000001s)]
*  $500 million a year in the United States. And then if, and we fully intend to commercialize [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1374.16s)]
*  the osteosarcoma indication ourselves in the United States, but we are looking for a global partner [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1381.92s)]
*  to reach the other 19,000 patients a year. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1388.24s)]
*  But we also see that pivoting to other solid tumors like breast cancer. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1391.2800000000002s)]
*  To be fair, Matt, when we first started the company, the only indication we had was [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1398.64s)]
*  osteosarcoma. So we had to make it work. We have since expanded up to all the other indications, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1402.5600000000002s)]
*  any other solid tumor that, you know, curto expresses. And it turns out [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1410.0s)]
*  you know, curto expresses, and it turns out most solid tumors express her two when they're [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1415.44s)]
*  metastasizing because the cancer is using that her two to set up vascularization in the lungs [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1420.64s)]
*  and the brain. So what we're going to do is quickly pivot to a phase three, either bundle or breast [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1427.92s)]
*  cancer trial. And that's obviously a huge unmet market, unmet medical need, there are still at [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1435.04s)]
*  least 40,000 people a year dying of breast cancer. We see colorectal cancer as an opportunity. But [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1446.1599999999999s)]
*  to your point, when we started, we were a one hit wonder. And if it hadn't worked, if the, if the, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1451.92s)]
*  and it looks like clinical trials working pretty well, and the side effects are very minimal. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1459.52s)]
*  But if it hadn't worked, we would have been out of luck. And so that's why we added the ABC [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1464.3200000000002s)]
*  technology. And then we had to have had the opportunity to add the canine indication, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1469.8400000000001s)]
*  which has been provisionally approved by the USDA. And then we added all the other indications. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1475.52s)]
*  And so it was about de-risking. It was about more shots on goal. But when we first started, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1481.44s)]
*  I don't know how to answer your question. How did I know that we could make it on osteosarcoma? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1490.08s)]
*  I don't know why I was so confident that we could. But I am now very confident [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1496.6399999999999s)]
*  that if we only had osteosarcoma, we'd be okay. But now that we have all the other [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1503.9199999999998s)]
*  indications, we could have a real impact on other solid tumors. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1509.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. You mentioned a couple of minutes ago, you referenced your cash conservancy. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1513.6000000000001s)]
*  Open up the curtain a little bit there. Give us some insight into how you've done so much with [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1521.92s)]
*  so little, where, you know, most companies would have spent a lot more money. What are sort of [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1528.88s)]
*  some of the central tenets of preserving your cash runway? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1534.56s)]
*  One of my favorite investors said, Paul, you can stretch a dollar like nobody I've ever seen. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1539.6s)]
*  One, we've done a lot with vendors. And two, we've had a lot of our vendors [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1549.84s)]
*  contribute in kind. I think the first couple quotes I got for a 20 patient phase two trial [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1560.96s)]
*  were in the $20 million range. I ended up, we did a 41 patient phase two trial for under $6 million. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1574.0s)]
*  And yeah, when they got that bid for the 20 million for 20 patients, I said, well, why don't [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1586.24s)]
*  we just have a central location and fly over all the families and their patient, the kids in [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1594.32s)]
*  to a central location on private jet, it would be cheaper. It just didn't make sense to me. And [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1600.1599999999999s)]
*  so obviously we didn't go with that proposal, but we did end up partnering with [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1606.9599999999998s)]
*  the CRO that's doing our trial, George clinical and Children's Oncology Group. It's also helping [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1613.12s)]
*  us run the trial has been a huge supporter. We have seven nonprofits that have invested [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1619.28s)]
*  into the company because they believe in our mission. And even if our clinical trial had failed, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1626.7199999999998s)]
*  which really seems like it is not, they would have advanced science in osteosarcoma. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1633.28s)]
*  But now that we seem to be having a trial that's making positive effects of the patients, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1640.48s)]
*  at least from around event free survival and overall survival. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1646.48s)]
*  If we can commercialize this and these nonprofits benefit financially, like [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1651.44s)]
*  the cystic fibrosis foundation did with vertex, where CFS sold their royalty stream for either [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1657.28s)]
*  4.3 or 5.3 billion. Can't remember which, but if these nonprofits that invested [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1665.68s)]
*  have some sort of return to them, they can not only be proud to say that they supported a company [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1672.6399999999999s)]
*  that brought a new treatment in osteosarcoma for the first time in 40 years, because they're still [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1680.56s)]
*  using doxyribosine, methotrexate and cisplatin. And so we're not going to be able to do that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1686.8799999999999s)]
*  Methotrexate and cisplatin, like they have for the last 40 years. And it's really toxic. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1693.6s)]
*  And it's for nine months. And it's really brutal on kids. But they can say, one, we've been involved [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1699.84s)]
*  and helped bring a new treatment. But then they can take the finances and work towards not only [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1707.52s)]
*  treatment, but cures and someday prevention. So that's what nonprofits, that's what disease state [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1716.48s)]
*  organizations are meant to do. And if we can help them do that, the better, the more the better. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1725.04s)]
*  What's the community involvement look like today? I mean, this started like as grassroots as I can [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  probably imagine, right? Like, you and Olivia's dad saying, hey, let's put some work into this. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1739.8400000000001s)]
*  We built a community, like you said, I mean, I saw the pictures online too, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1746.0800000000002s)]
*  the head shaving ceremonies and that kind of stuff. Now you're what, six, seven years in? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1750.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and the community has been phenomenal from the beginning. As I said, I emailed those eight [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1758.4s)]
*  doctors and they all emailed me the next morning. Two of them emailed saying, hey, we can't be on [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1764.72s)]
*  your scientific advisory board because we're conflicted, but we'll do anything we can for you. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1771.2s)]
*  And that was Richard Gerlach from MD Anderson who always responds to emails. He's just [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1775.68s)]
*  hugely supportive. And Dr. Katie Janeway of Harvard and Boston Children's, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1782.6399999999999s)]
*  who goes out of her way to help us. I mean, she was moving into a new house in Boston in July [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1787.04s)]
*  without air conditioning and took an investor call. So I mean, yeah, just that commitment. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1794.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the physicians, the parents, we have a patient advocacy advisory board that will go to [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1799.92s)]
*  the FDA with us. They include the father of Tyler Trent, Tony Trent. Tyler was the young man from [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1807.8400000000001s)]
*  ESPN who was the honorary coach for Purdue when they beat number one ranked Ohio State. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1816.24s)]
*  Apologize to some of the folks on here that may be the Ohio State fans, but [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1823.92s)]
*  I'm happy to revisit that story. My son's a sophomore at Penn State. So anytime Ohio State [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1830.56s)]
*  loses, we're happy to hear about it. So I mean, Scott Van Pelt, a lot of the folks at ESPN really [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1836.0s)]
*  took Tyler under their wing and it was just some emotional times for the disease. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1844.88s)]
*  Laura Sobiak, the Children's Cancer Research Fund is involved [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1850.5600000000002s)]
*  on the advisory back to the advisory board. Olivia's on that. A young lady who finished our [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1856.4s)]
*  clinical trial, which means she did not metastasize in the 48 weeks she is receiving our therapy. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1861.44s)]
*  She's on our patient advisory board. Mr. Matt Tichner, one of our bigger investors who [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1867.76s)]
*  is a very large venture capital on the biotech industry. He gives this large amount of money [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1873.92s)]
*  to the largest shareholder of Peloton when they sold to Merck. He got into biotech venture capital [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1879.76s)]
*  because his son Willie passed away of osteosarcoma over 20 years ago. So we're all trying to use [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1887.36s)]
*  a really horrible disease and make it better and hopefully make some other cancers better. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1898.8s)]
*  Scott Yeah, yeah. Your background, as I said, I mean, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1906.48s)]
*  you focused on public policy and government affairs. How like I've talked to CEOs and [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1912.96s)]
*  founders of biotechs that have come from every angle, from every facet. This might be a first. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1919.84s)]
*  I don't know that I've had a founder on who, you know, built their wheelhouse in government [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1925.76s)]
*  affairs and public policy. How would you say like that has supported the work that you're doing now [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1932.56s)]
*  as a founder and CEO of a biotech? Like, do you find yourself leaning into that? I mean, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1939.76s)]
*  obviously the network, you build a great network in that position. But what other, I guess, elements [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1945.52s)]
*  of that expertise serve you well in the role that you're in now? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1951.04s)]
*  Scott Well, little tongue in cheek, but, you know, I'd much rather be doing something easy, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1955.44s)]
*  like trying to create a new treatment for a really challenging pediatric cancer than [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1962.3200000000002s)]
*  dealing with politicians these days. But no, I think, you know, the opportunity to have served [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1968.8s)]
*  every department in a major biotech pharma company. Beringer & Gleheim at the time was [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1978.1599999999999s)]
*  the largest privately held biopharmaceutical company in the world. And our department [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1985.6799999999998s)]
*  supported every single department from research development, the commercialization side, the HR [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=1991.52s)]
*  legal. And so being involved with those product developments, along with some others at DI, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2000.32s)]
*  we were the first to really push the quality measurements way into the clinical research to [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2008.24s)]
*  make sure that eventually, you know, that product would get reimbursed. So, you know, supporting the [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2015.92s)]
*  development of these products and making sure that their launches were successful and that the [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2026.08s)]
*  access to these medicines, life-saving medicines from big pharma and big biotech really did prepare [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2031.84s)]
*  me and the rest of our team for getting stuff done. That's, you know, the beauty of being in a small [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2040.6399999999999s)]
*  company, small biotech, is that you get things done. And so that's one thing we've been talking [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2049.28s)]
*  about a lot recently, Matt, post IPO, which was about 48 days ago, 50 days ago. And that is as we [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2057.68s)]
*  grow, making sure that we keep a very entrepreneurial and collegiate culture. All of us that work at OS [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2066.4s)]
*  Therapy is really enjoy the work environment and the culture, but we also realize that it's [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2078.16s)]
*  much more productive than meetings upon meetings upon meetings. Take that a little bit deeper, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2084.96s)]
*  like more productive than meetings upon meetings upon meetings. What does that sort of that collegial [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2094.3999999999996s)]
*  culture entail? Like, how are we spending our time in a more constructive way? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2101.2s)]
*  But it's all about getting things done, making sure that the data is prepared, you know, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2107.36s)]
*  to prepare to get to the FDA. It's about getting supplies to the trials [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2114.48s)]
*  so that the patients receive the therapies. It's about making sure that investor calls and bankers [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2123.28s)]
*  are well aware of what the company is doing about transparency of the company. It's all about [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2132.0s)]
*  execution and making sure that we're executing on our strategy. And that's why we've been able to do [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2140.16s)]
*  so much with such limited funds and such in such an efficient way. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2147.44s)]
*  Yeah. What would you be doing if, what do you think you'd be doing right now if not for Olivia? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2157.04s)]
*  Would you still be consulting? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2167.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't, you know, there's a Luke Brian, Luke Combs song, What Would You Be Doing Now If You [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2169.36s)]
*  Weren't Doing This. I haven't heard that one. He basically says I'd still be singing my music in a [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2175.68s)]
*  bar, which is what I'm doing now, right? But I would hope that I would have found something [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2184.32s)]
*  as inspirational as this to do. You know, we started with what's, you know, small, rare cancer. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2193.1200000000003s)]
*  And look, Matt, if I were to be able to get rid of this nasty chemo for a small, rare disease [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2203.44s)]
*  like osteosarcoma and the community that I'm so close with, that would be absolutely a life [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2211.52s)]
*  check, right? Put me in the ground tomorrow. Good. But just think if we can significantly affect [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2217.36s)]
*  other solid tumors, you know, and I congratulate the industry and the folks that have worked on the [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2226.4s)]
*  blood, blood tumors. We in the solid tumor world have a lot longer, a lot further way to go. And [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2231.44s)]
*  so that inspires me. That inspires my entire team, all of the vendors that we work with. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2239.68s)]
*  Either they have the passion and the focus and the commitment to what we're doing or they're [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2246.56s)]
*  not involved. Yeah. There's, you know, two, you can start with either of these tracks you'd like. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2251.9199999999996s)]
*  It's sort of a two part story we're telling here between the osteo, the vaccine candidate and the [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2258.16s)]
*  ADC candidate. And they're, you know, they're, they're considered, I imagine there's a challenge, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2265.36s)]
*  an inherent challenge in managing the go forward plans for both of those because they're very [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2272.32s)]
*  different, go forward plans are very different markets. You know, look at the ADC space right [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2277.6s)]
*  now. You talked about your differentiating technology around the linker, but it's a very [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2281.28s)]
*  crowded space. I mean, there's a lot of activity in that, in that ADC market right now. So yeah, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2287.76s)]
*  maybe, maybe, maybe since I'm setting it up that way, we'll, we'll, we'll dwell on that one for a [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2292.8s)]
*  minute. What is your, like you bring this ADC technology in, it's, it's unique, it's differentiated, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2298.2400000000002s)]
*  it's novel. What's, give us the high level go forward plan with that candidate, as I said, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2305.2000000000003s)]
*  in the context of a pretty busy ADC biotech space. Well, they're both, both platform technologies [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2311.44s)]
*  are very dependent on each other. Even though they are very different, they dovetail nicely, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2319.36s)]
*  right? Because the HER2 is preventing metastasis, which in the long run is going to have the most [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2324.88s)]
*  significant effect on increasing survival. And then the ADC is debulking large solid tumors. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2332.32s)]
*  And so there's the thought that maybe we could use the ADCs at some point for osteosarcoma, even our [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2341.04s)]
*  original mission of the company. But as I often describe it, Matt, it's like having two children [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2348.4s)]
*  and you love them both, but you love them differently. I would say the first one, the HER2 [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2355.52s)]
*  is going to be the workhorse. It's further along the pipeline. We've finished the phase 2B trial. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2362.8s)]
*  We believe that to be a registration trial. We get a prior to review voucher from that. We use that [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2369.2000000000003s)]
*  to pivot to phase three and breast and lung cancer, which were and other solid tumors, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2374.64s)]
*  which would be a huge expansion in the company. All the while we're developing the ADC that's [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2380.4s)]
*  maybe further back. And as soon as we get through two week in GLP toxin, if we prove that our linkers [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2387.7599999999998s)]
*  and the coding really does work the way it has in our in vivo trials, then that becomes an [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2394.08s)]
*  out licensing opportunity while not even jeopardizing our therapeutic developments in the ADC space. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2402.64s)]
*  And all along that, there's the potential of us being bought out either for one platform or the [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2412.16s)]
*  other or both. And so we're a go forward commercialization. We're looking to partner [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2417.52s)]
*  in certain places. We certainly want to out license the canine osteosarcoma to a large animal health [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2426.24s)]
*  company. Osteosarcoma is the single largest disease killer of dogs, second only to automobiles. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2431.76s)]
*  So big market opportunity for an animal health company. And again, don't want to distract ourselves [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2442.32s)]
*  and the company from our mission around humans and around osteosarcoma and then all the solid tumors. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2449.1200000000003s)]
*  So yeah, the ADC space is crowded, but there are still a lot of problems and that market is going [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2455.8399999999997s)]
*  to be huge. As I said a couple years ago, and people thought I was crazy. ADCs are now what [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2463.2s)]
*  monoclonal antibodies were 10 years ago. Anyone not in the industry, you just look at a TV ad and [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2471.7599999999998s)]
*  it's whatever the generic is up that the brand name is, the generic ad ends with [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2479.2s)]
*  Mab. So monoclonal antibodies are all over the place. I think that's where ADCs will be in [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2487.04s)]
*  next six, eight, 10 years. Yeah. As you think about the optionality that you have moving forward, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2493.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, I'm not going to ask you to share your ideal situation, but any of them short of [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2500.08s)]
*  taking the ball all the way to the finish line yourself involves some degree of letting go of [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2510.08s)]
*  something that, I mean, change your life, right? Change the trajectory of your life. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2516.72s)]
*  How do you feel about that? What level of involvement will Paul Romness retain regardless [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2522.56s)]
*  of the outcome here? I have said from the beginning, this disease is bigger than any one person. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2530.64s)]
*  And so the other thing I've said is it will take all of us getting involved. And it means our [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2538.4s)]
*  investors, our vendors, patients, their parents, the clinicians, it will take all of us doing [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2545.04s)]
*  everything we can to be successful. So look, there have been a thousand places where this [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2552.7999999999997s)]
*  could have derailed before the clinical trial, before the in-licensing, during all that process, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2559.2799999999997s)]
*  the IPO. There are a thousand places, to be honest, going forward where things could go wrong, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2565.52s)]
*  but we've tackled every single one of those. We've done everything we said we would do. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2572.8s)]
*  Obviously it took more money and more time than you'd ever think, but we have executed [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2579.2s)]
*  and delivered on everything we said we would, and we're going to do the same moving forward. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2586.48s)]
*  But whether that includes me or anyone else, I've always said everyone is replaceable. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2592.96s)]
*  And if there's a time where someone can carry this mission further than me, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2601.1200000000003s)]
*  the mission is bigger than any one person. Yeah. The immediate horizon, what's on the immediate [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2608.88s)]
*  horizon for each of these candidates? What should we be looking out for? You talked a bit about the [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2615.84s)]
*  clinical trial and wrapping that up. What's the next step there? Yeah. So the phase two [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2622.24s)]
*  B clinical trial finished, technically finishes on October 1st, but the last kid got his last dose [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2628.3199999999997s)]
*  four weeks ago yesterday. We should have the data and the case matched control ready by the week [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2636.08s)]
*  after Thanksgiving. And we're an open label company sponsored trial. So we will most likely [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2643.92s)]
*  share that data. Obviously taking that data with the case match control to the FDA. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2654.48s)]
*  We're hoping for breakthrough designation. We're hoping for approval by the end of second quarter [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2662.08s)]
*  next year. That's on the human osteosarcoma. The canine osteosarcoma has been conditionally [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2669.52s)]
*  approved by the USDA. We do need to do a quick shedding trial, two week trial that measures [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2677.36s)]
*  if there's any residual biologic infection coming out of the dogs. You certainly don't want to have [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2685.6s)]
*  one dog urinating listeria or secreting listeria and another dog getting it. So in the previous [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2692.8s)]
*  trials with canines, it has been checked. Each dog's been checked to make sure they don't have [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2701.76s)]
*  listeria, but it was never measured. So we have to do that and submit that to USDA for full approval. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2708.0800000000004s)]
*  And then we look to Alex and find a partner who can commercialize that globally. We also will then [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2713.36s)]
*  quickly pivot next year into a phase three trial with standard care along with ROST HER2 in either [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2721.84s)]
*  breast cancer and or a bundle trial for that. And then as soon as we get through GLP talks for the [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2731.6000000000004s)]
*  ADCs, we'll look to partner on developing three to five ADCs to get I&Ds for and get into the clinic [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2739.36s)]
*  for that as well. Yeah, very exciting. Lots on your plate. You wouldn't have it any other way [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2749.04s)]
*  though, would you? You mentioned from the outset when you told Olivia's story that she's doing well [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2756.0s)]
*  and she's going to med school. Any idea what she's going to focus on? I wouldn't be surprised if she [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2763.84s)]
*  goes into pediatric oncology. She's working now at a pediatric [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2772.16s)]
*  physician's office here in the area and they just love her. So I think when you [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2779.92s)]
*  dodge a bullet like osteosarcoma, again, as I mentioned earlier, most kids and their families, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2789.2799999999997s)]
*  parents run from the disease. But some of the kids that have survived osteosarcoma have [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2795.68s)]
*  channeled that back into the disease and pediatric oncology. There was a, I think, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2806.16s)]
*  a physician's assistant from St. Jude's that actually went up in one of the space flights. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2812.72s)]
*  And there's a young lady that had a really bad genetic mutation of her osteosarcoma. It's called [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2819.2s)]
*  myc-amplification, M-Y-C. And it turns out she had a biological infection, kind of like what we're [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2828.72s)]
*  doing for our patients. And she survived. Otherwise, myc-amplification is a very, very poor [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2836.72s)]
*  diagnosis. She's now a pediatric oncology nurse. And so I could see Olivia doing that. It'd be [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2843.68s)]
*  full circle, that's for sure. Yeah. It feels kind of funny to talk about her without her here. I [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2853.68s)]
*  think the next time we have you on, Paul will have to bring Olivia on as well. Oh, it'd be great. She [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2859.12s)]
*  would definitely tell it like it is, Matt. Yeah, that's fantastic. Well, I appreciate you coming [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2865.2799999999997s)]
*  on, Paul. This has been very insightful and super inspiring work that you guys are doing. Thanks for [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2871.76s)]
*  sharing the story with us. And with everything coming down the pipe here in the next 12, 18 [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2876.5600000000004s)]
*  months, I'd love to have you back on for an update, maybe sometime next year when there's [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2883.76s)]
*  data to talk about and next steps and learn a little bit more about how you navigated that. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2888.5600000000004s)]
*  That'd be great, Matt. Thank you very much for your thoughtful approach. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HzgZTYV5MU&t=2894.5600000000004s)]
