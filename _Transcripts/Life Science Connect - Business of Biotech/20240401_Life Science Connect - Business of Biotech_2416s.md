# Funding Alzheimer's Tx Dev with ADDF's Karen Harris
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE)
*  The business of biotech is produced by LifeScience Connect and its community of learning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=0.0s)]
*  solving, and sourcing resources for biopharma decision makers. If you're working on biologics [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=5.2s)]
*  process development and manufacturing challenges, you need to swing by bioprocessonline.com. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=11.44s)]
*  If you're trying to stay ahead of the cell or gene therapy curve, visit cellandgene.com. When it's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=17.12s)]
*  time to map out your clinical course, let clinicalleader.com help. And if optimizing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=22.72s)]
*  outsourcing decisions is what you're after, check out outsourcepharma.com. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=28.4s)]
*  We're LifeScience Connect, and we're here to help. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  Venture philanthropy has remained one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy biotech funding [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=40.08s)]
*  scene. Couple that with rising unmet medical needs in neurodegeneration and the recent [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=45.84s)]
*  regulatory activity in the Alzheimer's therapeutic space. And you've got a situation where the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation's stock and relevance are steadily rising. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=57.68s)]
*  The ADDF is a venture philanthropy fund founded by the Lauder family, as in Estee, and supported [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=63.36s)]
*  generously by the likes of Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and the Dolby and Schwab families. Its mission is [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=70.4s)]
*  to accelerate the discovery of drugs to prevent, treat, and cure Alzheimer's disease. And it does [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=77.28s)]
*  that by investing in biotechs developing Alzheimer's therapeutics, much like a venture [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=82.88s)]
*  capitalist would, then directing its proceeds back into the fund. I'm Matt Piller. This is the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=87.6s)]
*  business of biotech. And the opportunity to sit down with ADDF Chief Financial Officer and Head [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=93.44s)]
*  of Mission Related Investments, Karen Harris in San Francisco, was one I didn't take lightly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=99.44s)]
*  Her perspective on Alzheimer's therapeutic progress, the market, what's fundable, and why, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=104.96s)]
*  is one of a kind. Let's give it a listen. I want to start with the foundation. I want to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=110.72s)]
*  get an understanding of the mission and the venture philanthropy model. So typically, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=116.24s)]
*  my energies are with biotech CEOs, the companies that are more than likely interested in partnering [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=122.8s)]
*  with you. I've only had a couple of venture philanthropy leaders on the show in the past. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=129.84s)]
*  So it's fascinating to me, though. I love that concept. So tell me about that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=136.0s)]
*  No, it's great to be here. There are a handful of venture philanthropies, but we're definitely [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=143.2s)]
*  a pretty unique animal. So the mission of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation is to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=149.04s)]
*  accelerate the development of drugs to prevent, treat, and hopefully eventually cure Alzheimer's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=155.68s)]
*  disease. And when we started, we were set up as a venture philanthropy by our founders, which were [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=162.72s)]
*  the Ronald and Leonard Lauder and then Dr. Howard Fillett, who's still there as our co-founder and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=171.6s)]
*  chief science officer. And they set us up as a venture philanthropy, which means instead of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=177.28s)]
*  giving grants to academia and to biotechs, we actually invest in them. So we invest in biotechs [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=182.88s)]
*  the same way a VC would invest in the biotech. We buy preferred stock or we buy convertible debt [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=192.0s)]
*  or royalty arrangements sometimes. And with academia, we have royalty arrangements. And [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=198.48s)]
*  what happens is the money that we get back from returns goes right back into the mission. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=203.92s)]
*  But I think donors seem to really like the model and like to know that their money is being used [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=210.08s)]
*  efficiently and that we are getting some return and then that gets plowed right back into ADDL. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=217.2s)]
*  Yeah, direct. I mean, the donors have to like the fact that there's a direct influence on [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  the real work, right? Yeah. Yeah, no, absolutely. And it gives us the opportunities to work with [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=228.56s)]
*  biotechs because it's kind of awkward if you're a nonprofit to be handing money to biotech companies. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  So I think this venture philanthropy model where we invest in the biotechs [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=241.12s)]
*  is just a better way to go about it for that type of thing. Yeah. Yeah. So and you're the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=246.88s)]
*  chief financial officer there. Tell me about that role. Like what does the CFOs get? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=253.52s)]
*  Sort of illustrate what the CFOs role is. What's your plan? Well, I feel like I have two jobs. So [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=257.92s)]
*  I'm the CFO and then I'm the head of mission related investing. And as the CFO, it's really [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=265.36s)]
*  my job to make sure that the donor's money gets placed as efficiently and as well as possible [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  into these Alzheimer's companies in order to accelerate a cure. And there's no pressure there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=282.64s)]
*  We're so lucky in that the Lauder family at the end of 2022 gave us a $200 million gift to cover [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=290.8s)]
*  our operating expenses for the next 15 to 20 years. So I take that very seriously to really [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=299.28s)]
*  steward their money to make sure it lasts for our operating costs as long as possible. But it's a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=307.12s)]
*  great position for a CFO to be in so that I don't have to worry about my operating costs and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=313.44s)]
*  all the donor's money that gets donated to us goes straight to the science, not to our operating [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=320.4s)]
*  costs. So this fact that all your money goes to research, I think is a very attractive thing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=326.64s)]
*  Yeah, that is fantastic. That's the CFO job. The head of mission related investing is since we do [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=333.04s)]
*  invest in biotechs, we have to structure the investments and negotiate the deals with the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=340.96s)]
*  biotech companies. And so I do all of the structuring and the negotiations of those deals. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=347.68s)]
*  And the reason that works so well is I have an investment banking background. And so I'm able [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=355.44s)]
*  to use a lot of that for structuring these deals. When I was starting out in investment banking, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  I worked on a lot of biotech IPOs. And so a lot of that knowledge is very helpful when dealing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=369.28s)]
*  with these biotech companies. And it's such a treat to work with these companies. They are just [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=376.32s)]
*  so dedicated and they just don't give up. It's been hard to raise money this year. And I'm really [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=382.64s)]
*  just always super impressed by their commitment. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've interviewed hundreds of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  them, biotech experts. And the commitment and the optimism, it's all on full display. It seems [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=399.04s)]
*  like that's even ratcheted up a notch in the Alzheimer's space because so many people have [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=405.6s)]
*  been affected by it and have personal experience. Yeah, I think that's true. I think almost anybody [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=410.16s)]
*  you talk to has a mother-in-law or a sister or an aunt or somebody who's been touched by Alzheimer's. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=417.76s)]
*  And I think the fact that for 20 to 30 years, there was no drug approved. And now we have two [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=426.24s)]
*  that were one that has been approved by the FDA and another from Eli Lilly that's about to be. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=433.68s)]
*  And so it's a really exciting time in the Alzheimer's field right now. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=440.56s)]
*  Sure is. Yeah. You mentioned that prior to ADDF, you were in investment banking. And [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=445.12s)]
*  I'm curious about that. I looked at your background for the interview and it's intriguing to me. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=453.12s)]
*  You were in pretty big name investment banking after you earned your Columbia undergrad in [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=460.88s)]
*  economics and your Stanford MBA in finance. When I look at your career, at least on paper, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=466.32s)]
*  on LinkedIn, the latter half of it seems like it's very focused on endeavors that are far from [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=471.76s)]
*  getting rich and making rich people richer. Yes. Tell me about that. I looked at Mount Sinai [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=479.04s)]
*  Adolescent Health Center, East Harlem Tutorial Program, and now the ADDF. Tell me about that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=485.04s)]
*  Yeah. So I left UBS in 2012 to join a hedge fund. And after a while, several months, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  I really came to the conclusion that the world did not need this other hedge fund, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=502.32s)]
*  we have enough hedge funds. And I didn't really feel that we were going to be so much better than [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=507.76s)]
*  anybody else. And my dad had done a lot of nonprofit work after he retired. And so I [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  investigated, I took some courses at NYU New York University in philanthropy, and I liked it. So I [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=520.96s)]
*  decided I would try it out. And I think that I really felt that I wanted to do mission-related [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=528.96s)]
*  work at that point. And I first went into development. And I don't really know why I [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=537.04s)]
*  did that. I think I did that because I liked the classes, which is a very silly way to pick anything. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  And I worked at the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center, eventually as their Director of Development. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  And it was very interesting. I liked it, but I missed finance. And so then I moved to the East [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=560.48s)]
*  Harlem Tutorial Program, which is charter schools in East Harlem, and was the CFO there, and then [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=568.96s)]
*  ultimately got recruited to ADDF. But I'm very happy to have worked at these social services [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=577.76s)]
*  organizations for several years. Yeah, I can imagine. It's fulfilling, much more fulfilling [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=584.16s)]
*  than running a hedge fund. The ADDF recruitment, how did that come to pass? You know, it was COVID, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  and I just got a call from a recruiter. And I think I had met her once before. And she just [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=598.56s)]
*  called, and I had interviews completely online. And I think it was a year before I met the CEO [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  in person, because it was like smack in the middle of the really bad COVID. But I thought this would [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=615.28s)]
*  be super interesting. And it was different. But the whole investment part of it was really [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=622.64s)]
*  interesting to me. For sure. Yeah, kind of brought you back to that world that you had been in. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=629.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of the perfect job, because I get to really match the investment banking skills, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=635.68s)]
*  as well as the CFO skills. So I really can't think of a more perfect job for me. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=643.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. So I want to talk a little bit more about ADDF and what it's supporting. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=649.92s)]
*  As you know, the bulk of our audience are biotech executives, CEOs, many of whom, founders, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=657.28s)]
*  many of whom worked in the Alzheimer's space. You guys support the advance of both diagnostics [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  and therapeutics? So yeah, we're involved in diagnostics, therapeutics, and prevention. So [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=667.04s)]
*  those are really our three pillars. And in the therapeutic space, we are investing in companies [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=673.04s)]
*  that are developing drugs based on the biology of aging. So drugs that will treat the underlying [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=683.2s)]
*  diseases of aging with the idea that if we can treat that, then we can ultimately reduce Alzheimer's, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=690.64s)]
*  because Alzheimer's ultimately is a disease of aging. And we decided about 10 years ago [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=699.92s)]
*  not to focus on amyloid, which is what these new drugs are, because pharma was focusing on amyloid [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=708.8s)]
*  and pouring tons of money into it. So we wanted to invest where we thought that our money [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=715.92s)]
*  would be more useful in novel ideas. And as it turns out, where the science has moved now [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  is towards the biology of aging, because these amyloid drugs are shown, they reduce amyloid, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  but I still think the jury's out as to how effective, maybe they'll slow cognitive decline [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=737.5999999999999s)]
*  by 30%. But that's not enough. And we think that a lot of these other ideas are going to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=744.8s)]
*  come to fruition. And ultimately, it's going to be a combination therapy or precision medicine [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=752.32s)]
*  that is going to cure Alzheimer's, much in the way that cancer space does it with their immunotherapy. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=760.0s)]
*  So we really take in, my CEO likes to say shots on goal. And we've taken a lot of shots on goal. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=766.16s)]
*  And our co-founder and chief science officer is an absolute, we call him the truffle hound, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=776.4s)]
*  because he just seems to be able to seek out the most interesting biotech companies. And [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=785.68s)]
*  we've done quite well with some of them. We invested early on in a program that was licensed by [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=792.8s)]
*  Abbott Pharmaceuticals, and then the company was bought by Eli Lilly. And it was the first [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=804.0799999999999s)]
*  PET scan to actually be able to identify amyloid, because before that, there was no way to really [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=810.16s)]
*  tell if you had Alzheimer's, except for either cognitive interview, which doesn't, you know, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=817.92s)]
*  that's not very scientific, or else an autopsy after death. So that was one of the things that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=824.9599999999999s)]
*  we invested in early on, as well as blood tests for the diagnosis. And I think now with these [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=831.92s)]
*  anti-amyloid drugs, there's going to be a need to figure out who has Alzheimer's in an easier way [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=841.44s)]
*  than the PET scan. And I think a lot of blood tests are being developed now, some already marketed. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=848.0s)]
*  So that's really, that's diagnostics as well. And that's the diagnostics part of the business. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=854.08s)]
*  And there we have $100 million that was given, donated to us from the Gates, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=859.92s)]
*  from Bill Gates and other philanthropists Leonard Lauder. And we are using that money to try to [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=870.24s)]
*  accelerate the detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's with the thought that the earlier [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=878.32s)]
*  you can detect it, the better off you're going to be in the more probable that you could get a [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=886.08s)]
*  treatment that would work. We have invested in therapeutics this year, 34 million, we'll invest [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=892.48s)]
*  45 million next year. And then we have the diagnostic accelerator money to invest, but [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=900.48s)]
*  our biomarker team and our therapeutics team talk all the time and are completely [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=907.5200000000001s)]
*  married at the hip because the two really go together. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=916.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Is the truffle hunting more difficult on the therapeutic side than it is on the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  diagnostic side? Yeah, you know, it's different. And I think therapeutics take a lot longer to [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=926.24s)]
*  come to market. So you have to wait longer. But I think the returns are ultimately better in the [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=936.24s)]
*  end. So I think if somebody comes up with the therapeutic for Alzheimer's that really works, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=942.24s)]
*  that's going to make a lot more money than the diagnostic test that told you that a person [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=950.16s)]
*  would have Alzheimer's. But I do think that it's quicker to market the diagnostic tools. And [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=956.0s)]
*  it's absolutely essential. If you think about it, imagine if we didn't have a way to tell whether [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=962.64s)]
*  you have high blood pressure. And it really helps in the clinical trials because they used to do [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=969.68s)]
*  clinical trials and a quarter of the people wouldn't even have Alzheimer's because there [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=977.12s)]
*  was no way to really know. They just guess. So it's very important when you're doing the [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=983.28s)]
*  clinical trials and also when you're measuring the endpoint to see if your therapy is effective, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=989.04s)]
*  to have a good biomarker to be able to actually know whether your drug is doing the appropriate [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=995.04s)]
*  work. Sure. And as those drugs become more precision, presumably, the diagnostic tools [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1001.76s)]
*  are going to be key because precision drugs and their correlation to stage of diagnosis, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  they've got to work hand in hand. Absolutely. Absolutely. And that is why the Diagnostics [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1017.1999999999999s)]
*  Accelerator is trying to fund novel biomarkers. So there might be a biomarker for inflammation, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1023.04s)]
*  for vascular disease, because these things are other aspects of Alzheimer's that people have [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1033.28s)]
*  and will ultimately need to be measured. So speaking of the therapeutic focus, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1042.8799999999999s)]
*  do you have any favorite horses in the race in terms of modalities? Yes. So as I said, we invest [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  in companies that are focused on the biology of aging. And in terms of the stage that we're [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1057.12s)]
*  interested in, it's typically now the IND enabling stage or proof of concept, phase one, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1063.6s)]
*  proof of concept trials, and then early phase two, because that's where our money is going to [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1071.6s)]
*  be the most meaningful. Then later for the phase three trials, they're going to need hundreds of [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1077.28s)]
*  millions of dollars. And we don't have that money. So we're trying to invest in ideas that [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1084.8s)]
*  ultimately can raise future money from the VCs and from pharma and be able to continue on after [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1091.76s)]
*  our donations done. But we do give a lot of follow on donations as well. When you first [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1103.44s)]
*  survey opportunities or entertain opportunities, let me stop there and focus there for a minute. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1111.2800000000002s)]
*  Are you typically hunting or are you typically being courted or is it a combination of the two? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1118.96s)]
*  It's a combination of both. So we are always looking for areas of our portfolio of investments [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1125.44s)]
*  where maybe we're lacking, like, oh, maybe here's an idea where we don't have any drugs being tested [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1133.6s)]
*  for this in our portfolio, like maybe it's gene therapy. So we would be actively looking. But [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1142.1599999999999s)]
*  also we have several RFPs that we do. And we have a lot of incoming requests. You can imagine in this [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1150.8s)]
*  down market, all the demand. And what I would say about our model is while we do want the returns [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1158.72s)]
*  that VCs get, we don't have limited partners. And we focus the most important thing for us as a science [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1168.4s)]
*  and we hope to make a good return. But we're not so much focused on the returns as we are on the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1177.1200000000001s)]
*  science. And so in this difficult market, we've been able to fund companies that have trouble [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1186.8s)]
*  finding money anywhere else. And what we found is that our scientific diligence is so admired at ADDF [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1193.12s)]
*  that often we are like the stamp of approval that enables these companies to get future funding. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1202.96s)]
*  And a lot of the time people will say, well, can we sign your contract early? Because the next [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1209.52s)]
*  venture partner won't come in until you've actually signed. So we see a lot of that. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1216.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. What is the scientific validation [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  component look like? You have like a board? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1227.2s)]
*  Yeah. So we have, I'm going to get the number wrong, but I think it's like we have like 19 PhD [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1229.44s)]
*  scientists on board. And so the first investigation is an internal one. And then if we [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1237.68s)]
*  like an idea and we think it will fit well in our portfolio, then we have outside reviewers [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  review it. These are prominent people in the Alzheimer's field. And then after that, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1252.56s)]
*  it goes to our scientific investment committee who study the idea and vote to approve or not [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1259.3600000000001s)]
*  to approve. So that is our scientific method. And obviously over the years, we've developed [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1267.36s)]
*  such an expertise in Alzheimer's specifically that I think a lot of the VCs really admire that [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1274.3999999999999s)]
*  knowledge. Yeah. As far as scientific analysis of potential partners goes, have you noticed any [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1283.6799999999998s)]
*  trends or do you have any preferences in terms of that? You mentioned gene therapy, for instance. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1292.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, is small mall more attractive than a biologic, more attractive than a gene therapy? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1296.96s)]
*  Any trends there or are you pretty agnostic? I think we are pretty agnostic in sort of this. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1304.64s)]
*  We think there are going to be a lot of targets and we like to have a good range of things. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1311.68s)]
*  A couple of companies, for example, like we invest in Lexio Therapeutics, which happens to [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1320.72s)]
*  have just presented at the JPMorgan Conference and they're a genetic medicine company, a clinical [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1328.72s)]
*  stage genetic medicine. So that's one company that we invested in early in 2014 where we actually [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1337.52s)]
*  invested when the idea was at Weill Cornell University. And then it somehow got into, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1347.2s)]
*  became a company, Lexio or Lexio bought it. I don't know how. And then [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  it just went public. So we made another investment in 2020 and now it's gone public. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1364.32s)]
*  So that's one company and it's very rewarding to us when we identify something in 2014 [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1369.52s)]
*  and then it becomes part of a public company. So that's very interesting for us. We have [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1376.96s)]
*  one company that does a monoclonal antibody for inflammatory fibrin, which is supposed to [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1386.24s)]
*  be bad for the neurons and cognitive declines. That's another company we invested in 2019 and [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  now again in 2023. And they are doing their series A right now and are trying to fund the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1404.0s)]
*  phase two study. Yeah, that's great. You talked a little bit about how ADDS support is seen as a [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1412.32s)]
*  song actor sort of stamp of approval. Do you look for, you might have touched on this, but I'm [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1421.68s)]
*  curious about how it's maybe changed in the recent financial climate. Do you look for [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1427.84s)]
*  companies that have, like your reputation is often determined by the company you keep, right? Do you [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1435.28s)]
*  look for companies that have specific business development support from specific firms or even [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1441.84s)]
*  pharma companies? Well, we typically would invest before the pharma companies would come in [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1449.36s)]
*  and we're really trying to get these companies ready for pharma. So no, I wouldn't say so much. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1456.8s)]
*  I wouldn't really say that so much. I think we're investing 100% based on what we think is the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1465.68s)]
*  validity of the science. Yeah. All right. Once you validate the science and strike a partnership, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1473.28s)]
*  is it pretty, maybe not monetarily, but is it pretty cookie cutter? Like is it pretty [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1482.16s)]
*  automated? Yeah. So once the science is validated, then it comes to the, we negotiate the deal [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1487.28s)]
*  and then it comes to our investment committee. So then we do have an investment committee that [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1495.2s)]
*  has to approve the terms of the deal. And they're really the ones who want to see that we're getting [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1500.4s)]
*  venture-like returns and that we've actually structured and negotiated a good deal. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1507.04s)]
*  And it's actually not cookie cutter because ADDF, we don't invest directly, well, we do. We buy [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1514.08s)]
*  preferred stock, but that money that we give a company has to go to a specific project with [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1523.6799999999998s)]
*  the budget and a work plan. And so we're in very close touch helping the companies design [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1530.32s)]
*  the projects and design the clinical trials and we help them with IP and with business plans. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1536.8799999999999s)]
*  So we're having a very close relationship even before we approve the proposal. And then once [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1544.08s)]
*  it's approved and once they start working, doing the work, we stay in touch with them very closely [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1550.6399999999999s)]
*  to see how it's going and how we can set them up for success. And even after, we've done a lot of [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1557.68s)]
*  follow-on deals this year and we tend to like to do that and to really help our companies prosper. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1566.0s)]
*  That's cool. What is the sort of the, I don't know, day-to-day, not necessarily day-to-day, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1574.88s)]
*  but that sort of relationship management aspect? Are there like customer relationship managers at [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1580.4s)]
*  ADDF that work with these folks or is it? We're a non-profit. No, it's really the science teams [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1585.44s)]
*  that work with them. I work with them if there are any finance related issues or anything related to [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1593.52s)]
*  the structure of the deal. Do they need an extension on their convertible? No, you know, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1600.72s)]
*  those kinds of things. But the scientists are really working with them on a day-to-day basis. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1605.44s)]
*  With regards to how the project is going. The venture philanthropy model in general, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1613.28s)]
*  how has the recent economic headwinds impacted the venture philanthropists in general? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1624.0s)]
*  Are you fairly insulated or is it impacted? Well, what I would say is it's actually made [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1635.28s)]
*  the venture philanthropy model that much more important. We do a lot of what I call bridge [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1641.44s)]
*  financing, which is this say you have a company and they needed to raise their Series A by January [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1646.96s)]
*  or else they're going to run out of money and can't complete the next trial. Here it's happened [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1655.52s)]
*  quite a number of times in this market where the companies are unable to complete the Series A [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1662.56s)]
*  on time. They just can't get the investors. And so we provide bridge financing, which is usually in [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1670.24s)]
*  the form of a convertible note, which is debt that's going to convert into equity and basically [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1676.56s)]
*  bridge them over to tie them over to when they're able to finally close their preferred round. And [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1682.88s)]
*  we've done a lot of that this year and we just need to make careful that the company does have [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1689.04s)]
*  enough cash to continue on and finish our project and ultimately will have results that will draw [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1696.8s)]
*  in the money of venture capital and of pharma potentially, or they could go to the public markets. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1704.6399999999999s)]
*  But I think that ADDF stamp of approval and this bridge financing, it's something we can do because [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1712.96s)]
*  once again, we don't need the venture return. We really want the science to progress. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1722.24s)]
*  Is bridge financing a risky proposition? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1731.52s)]
*  It is a risky proposition because you don't know if the Series A or B or C is actually going to get [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1736.08s)]
*  done. So yes, it's definitely a risky proposition and ADDF can take that risk when others don't want [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1744.8s)]
*  to. And I think that ADDF by taking that risk helps venture firms feel comfortable about investing, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1752.32s)]
*  but it is definitely a risk. And the investment committee is very careful about making sure that [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1761.76s)]
*  that company has a plan to be able to stay in business and continue and finish our project. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1770.32s)]
*  So usually what we like to see is that there's some reflection point coming up where there are [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1778.8s)]
*  going to be results announced and therefore they can draw in additional capital. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1785.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. What is your general sense for, obviously in this environment, Karen, like everyone's [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1791.92s)]
*  sunshine and roses, it's JP Morgan. Everyone's happy. But I'm picking up on some genuine [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1802.56s)]
*  sentiment that things are improving. What's your take? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1812.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think that it has been extremely difficult. It's been a very bad market. The public markets [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1819.2s)]
*  have been terrible. The IPO markets are pretty closed up until maybe the fourth quarter of this [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1825.9199999999998s)]
*  year. And it's really hard to get venture investors to invest now because they weren't able to take [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1832.8s)]
*  their companies public. So they're having to put money into their existing companies rather than [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1841.36s)]
*  new companies. So as a new company to get a lead investor is really, really hard right now. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1847.52s)]
*  I think things are looking up. There's been an uptick in the biotech index in the last few weeks, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1854.16s)]
*  really, with a lot of mergers that have been announced. And what's interesting for us is [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1864.08s)]
*  we've seen two mergers, one from Merck of Carowake Therapeutics and one from Avie of a company called [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1871.04s)]
*  Ciroval, both CNS companies. And those are among the most risky. And so that leads me to believe [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1880.24s)]
*  that somehow the valuations are low enough that the market is going to turn. So we've seen a lot [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1887.6000000000001s)]
*  of M&A. There's been a lot of M&A announced at JP Morgan. And interest rates are projected to [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1894.4s)]
*  come down. And I think if that happens, then it will be a big help to these biotechs. And ultimately, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1900.48s)]
*  people will start investing again. I mean, the valuations, I would say that the boom years of [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1910.08s)]
*  2020 and 2021 were maybe a little over exuberant. And the valuations were too high. And a lot of [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1916.08s)]
*  companies were able to go public that shouldn't be public companies that are now trading at a dollar [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1923.04s)]
*  a share. So I think that there's that overhang in the market. But I do think we've seen two IPOs of [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1929.2s)]
*  CNS related companies. One is Lexio and another is Neumara Therapeutics. And there again, they're both [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1937.3600000000001s)]
*  trading now above issue price. So that leads me to believe that the market is going to get better. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1946.64s)]
*  I think it's going to take a little while. But I think by the end of 2024 and 2025, things are [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1952.96s)]
*  going to be better. And how does that like how do you envision that hopeful improvement impacting [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1959.76s)]
*  ADDF? Like, what does that do for you? Well, one thing that does for us is to help us [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1967.44s)]
*  get returns. So basically, we call them mission related returns. So if the public markets [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1976.8799999999999s)]
*  turn and a lot of our companies can do initial public offerings, we typically once an investment [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1986.0s)]
*  becomes liquid, we sell. We make sure we sell in a way that we won't hurt the stock price of the [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1992.1599999999999s)]
*  company. So very slowly over time. But we believed that once we gain liquidity, we should sell and [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=1998.96s)]
*  then make investments in other science. And so I think that we'll get a lot. We will see a lot of [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2006.32s)]
*  M&A where we will get returns or we will see IPOs where we're going to get returns. So [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2018.88s)]
*  we're hoping for that money gets plowed right back into the science. And also with the new [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2026.0800000000002s)]
*  drug approvals for Alzheimer's, we're seeing an increased interest in just CNS related work. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2034.0800000000002s)]
*  And I've seen from the VCs an interest to get educated on the neurodegenerative disease. And [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2044.64s)]
*  we call them neuro curious VCs. And I think a lot of VCs wouldn't invest in the neuro world [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2055.2s)]
*  because it was too risky. And I think maybe they're going to start coming in now. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2064.24s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, the association with anti-aging, the anti-aging space, I mean, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2069.3599999999997s)]
*  that's a hot space right now. And I can see the VC appetite in that space and [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2076.16s)]
*  creating things to turn around too. So it's a good corollary, right? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2083.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes. The anti-aging space is really interesting. And I was hoping to hear more about it at JP [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2087.7599999999998s)]
*  Morgan. We didn't, but everybody seems to be interested in anti-aging. It seems to be [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2094.08s)]
*  the thing right now, there was recently our CEO attended a conference in Saudi Arabia [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2103.12s)]
*  by a fund called Havolution, which is the Saudi Crown Princess Fund that's going to invest a billion [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2114.96s)]
*  dollars a year in anti-aging. And we are trying to get some of the sovereign wealth money to go [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2122.1600000000003s)]
*  towards Alzheimer's, which is a disease of aging. So we are trying to get some of that money into [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2128.72s)]
*  Alzheimer's. Yeah. Very good. When you come to an investor conference like this, you're in a unique [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2138.16s)]
*  position, CFO of a venture philanthropy fund. What's your goal? What's your demo here? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2144.48s)]
*  I'm very interested to see what the public companies are doing in the neurodegenerative [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2151.8399999999997s)]
*  space. So I make sure to see those companies, to see Biogen, who is introducing their Alzheimer's [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2158.56s)]
*  drug and Lilly to talk about their drug. So I'm interested in seeing those companies. I'm also [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2167.2s)]
*  very interested in understanding when they think the market's going to return, because [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2174.0s)]
*  you know, I have ADDF can have an opinion, but I'm very interested in the investor's opinion as to [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2182.08s)]
*  when the market's going to come back. And then I've been meeting a lot of the CEOs of either [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2188.16s)]
*  companies we already fund or companies that are in the process of applying to get funding from us. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2193.92s)]
*  So I've been meeting with a lot of them, as well as some people on the venture side, because [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2202.64s)]
*  one thing we try to do for our companies is to get additional venture money into them. So it's [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2209.44s)]
*  very helpful at ADDF to have venture connections so that we can help our companies raise money. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2216.8s)]
*  Yeah. What's the appropriate way for a company who's interested in working with you to, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2224.48s)]
*  what's the channel to get the conversation started? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2229.68s)]
*  So I would say that, you know, we're interested in companies focused on the biology of aging [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2233.12s)]
*  at the clinical stage. And if you fit that model, reach out to our scientists. We have several RFPs. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2240.08s)]
*  So look at our website. And we really do encourage people to start the conversation. We're [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2250.4s)]
*  interested in unique, innovative science, and our scientists are always happy to talk to you. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2257.2s)]
*  Good. If I were a better interviewer, what would I have asked you that I didn't? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2265.52s)]
*  Let me think about that. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2276.56s)]
*  Well, if you have to think about it, I must have done a pretty good job. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2280.0s)]
*  I think you did a great job. And I'm not sure what else you could have asked me. But [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2283.12s)]
*  I think it's been a great discussion and I'm very happy for people to know more about venture [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2290.64s)]
*  philanthropy. And also, I want to really help our biotech companies who are doing research in [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2296.7200000000003s)]
*  Alzheimer's. It's such an important area. And these biotech companies are just, you know, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2304.88s)]
*  they never stop working. And it's just very impressive. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2311.44s)]
*  It is. And the work that you're doing is very impressive, too. I just recalled that, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2315.12s)]
*  as I said, I don't often have venture philanthropists on the show. But the last [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2319.84s)]
*  time I did was a couple of years ago. I think it was JDDF, Katie Alley, or something. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2325.12s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2329.6s)]
*  You know, Katie at all. But it's fascinating conversation with her as well. I admire the [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2330.32s)]
*  work that folks like you do. And I encourage you to keep up that work and I wish you all the best [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2334.4s)]
*  success in 2024. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2341.12s)]
*  Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate having this conversation. It's been very fun. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2342.56s)]
*  Yeah, we'll get back together and do it again. You know, maybe the next wave of Alzheimer's [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2348.0s)]
*  approval. We'll get into the... [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2354.4s)]
*  Yeah, that would be very interesting. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2355.6800000000003s)]
*  Break some of that. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2358.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we're looking forward to the next approval. So absolutely. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2358.64s)]
*  Great. Great. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2362.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, Karen Harris, pleasure to meet you. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1si1RpjCEE&t=2364.08s)]
