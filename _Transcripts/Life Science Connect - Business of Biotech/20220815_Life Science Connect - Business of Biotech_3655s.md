Video Description: Raman Sehgal has made a career out of putting his energy— and he's got a lot of it— into building biotech outsourcing companies and the people who make them run. After years spent supporting several from within, he launched ramarketing, a firm dedicated to helping CROs, CDMOs, CPOs, and other providers to the biotech ecosystem build their businesses, in 2009. He's also an international best-selling author (The Floundering Founder), co-founder of life sciences recruitment firm Lead Candidate, and founder & host of the Molecule to Market podcast. 
On this week's episode of the Business of Biotech, Raman brings us his unique and multifaceted perspectives on the biopharma outsourcing space, the bear biotech markets, and how both are impacting the work of early- and clinical-stage biopharma leaders.

# Observations On Outsourcing With Molecule To Market's Raman Sehgal
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [August 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc)
*  Welcome back to the Business of Biotech. I'm Matt Piller. And while today's show represents [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=0.0s)]
*  a bit of a departure in terms of guest selection, I fully trust it's going to be an informative [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=9.36s)]
*  and valuable chat. If you did the math, I'm estimating around 96.7% of my guests are leaders [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=14.68s)]
*  of companies developing biologic therapies, founders, CEOs, CSOs, CMOs, and so on. And [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=22.76s)]
*  that's obviously by design. But a bit earlier this year, I came upon a podcast called Molecule [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  to Market. I gave it a listen and I instantly became a fan of its host, Raman Sehgal. Like [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  me, Raman is not a scientist or an MD, but he's a guy who's deeply invested in the life [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  sciences community and its people. And he's specifically dialed into the burgeoning CMO [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=49.04s)]
*  and CDMO spaces where his professional roots are sunk. He got a start in traditional MarCom [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=54.76s)]
*  roles, then cut his life sciences teeth at the specials laboratory and SCM Pharma before [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=60.76s)]
*  launching his own firm. He's an entrepreneur. He's a bestselling author. He's a podcaster. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=66.44s)]
*  He's a blogger. He's a husband. He's a dad. And he's one of the most enthusiastic, energetic, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  engaging, inquisitive, and genuine people I've met. And I'm super happy to introduce him to you, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=78.36s)]
*  Raman. Welcome to the show. Oh, thanks, Matt. That is quite a lovely intro. So I feel very honored [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=84.76s)]
*  to be here on your show, especially as I'm a seemingly a bit of a wild card. So thank you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=91.56s)]
*  very much for having me. You know, it's fun to be the wild card, isn't it? You know, I mean, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=96.12s)]
*  your roots in this space are far deeper than mine, by the way. I've been covering the life [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=100.84s)]
*  sciences and specifically biotech, biopharma for, I don't know, about three years now, I think. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=106.76s)]
*  You know, your roots, at least you've got that marketing manufacturing experience. And we're [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  going to get into that a little bit when we talk about that space. But I, you know, I, as I said, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=116.44s)]
*  the first time I heard your pod, I just knew instantly, like, that's a guy that I'd like to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=122.36s)]
*  have on my show because of, you know, like I said, your inquisitive nature, your energy level, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  and just your chops in the space. One of my favorite episodes, by the way, was with the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=133.0s)]
*  Biofarm guy. That was a terrific episode. That was a good one. If you're going to check out [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=137.64s)]
*  Molecule to Market, check out that interview with the Biofarm guy. And Molecule to Market is where [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=141.88s)]
*  I want to start, Ron. I want to start with the podcast because like I said, that was kind of my [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=147.32s)]
*  first exposure to you. And I'm not going to do it justice. So I'll let you do the talking here. But [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=150.92s)]
*  Molecule to Market is a pharmaceutical-focused podcast, but more specifically, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=157.08s)]
*  you kind of spin around the circle of the outsourcing space, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=164.44000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. So it's very much a platform to have a conversation with [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=169.0s)]
*  an interesting personality from the outsourcing space, be it on the vendor side or on the kind [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  of drug sponsor side as well. Obviously, as the market has developed over the last 20 years or so, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=181.0s)]
*  the outsourcing space has become bigger and bigger. And some of the firms in that space are as large [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=188.2s)]
*  as some of the big pharma companies these days. So it's focusing on leaders and businesses and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=196.36s)]
*  interesting personalities. And it could be preclinical CROs, it could be clinical research [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=202.44s)]
*  organizations, CDMOs, packaging companies, analytical tech companies, anyone that's providing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=207.32s)]
*  some kind of support or service to the pharma and biotech community is the bulk of the guests. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=214.84s)]
*  But as I mentioned, we do get some guests on from, I suppose, the buyer side, which is always [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=219.64s)]
*  really interesting as well to get some kind of counter perspective. And interestingly, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=225.32s)]
*  that's when I came across the exact opposite of your story I came across because I went, oh, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=228.76s)]
*  this is a market where these are the folks, our audience is typically aiming at. So it's great [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=233.16s)]
*  that we can do this and kind of, you know, those industries or those subsectors are colliding in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=241.32s)]
*  real time. So it makes sense for us to collide these podcasts as well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=246.84s)]
*  RG Guys, they sure are colliding in real time. We're going to touch on that a little bit, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=250.44s)]
*  but you bring up a really interesting point, you know, like, that's one of the reasons I was [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=254.44s)]
*  so comfortable and wanted to have you on the show, right? Like I generally do not invite by design [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=258.44s)]
*  the leaders of CMOs and CDMOs and CDMOs and CROs on the show. And we'll talk about why that is a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  little bit later. And, you know, that's a good thing. We can work synergistically. There's no [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=271.56s)]
*  competition here, Rami. Exactly. Not at all. Yeah. Don't let your pendulum swing too far [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=277.32s)]
*  toward that sponsor side. Then we're going to have problems. Why was 2020, you launched the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=282.68s)]
*  podcast in 2020. Why was that, I guess, a pivotal moment? I mean, I'm assuming it was a pivotal [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=290.12s)]
*  moment. That's when you decided to do it. What was going on there that, you know, that sort of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=295.48s)]
*  incited this idea? So historically, I'm a massive fan of podcasts. And I used to do, when I was a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=300.68s)]
*  kid in my early twenties, I used to do local radio DJing and stuff like that. I always quite [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=308.84s)]
*  fancied myself as a DJ and then real life hits and you have to get a job and all that kind of stuff. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=314.2s)]
*  And I just podcasting added so much value to my life. It's been a big part of my personal growth [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  and my business growth and all that type of thing. And I always fancied doing a podcast. I never [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=326.12s)]
*  got around to thinking about what I'm going to do it on and what the subject is, because [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=332.28s)]
*  it's a very fragmented and a ballooning space now podcasting. And then I actually remember the flight [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=336.44s)]
*  I was on, which was to JP Morgan in January of 2020, just prior to COVID. And I was fine. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=345.0s)]
*  I was living in Boston and I was flying to San Francisco and I had six, seven hours on a plane. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=351.72s)]
*  I remember I just moved to the US relatively recently and I was scratching my head saying, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=357.56s)]
*  how big is this country? I've got seven hours on a flight. In the UK that would get me to Dubai. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=361.47999999999996s)]
*  But I used that time to really think about what people might find useful and where was my expertise [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=369.88s)]
*  and where was my network? And it was very much thinking about something that no one had done [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=376.28s)]
*  before, but actually that I was passionate about and I could give sticking power. I mean, Matt, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=382.12s)]
*  you've probably seen the amount of podcasts that come and go. And there's like a graveyard of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=386.92s)]
*  podcasts out there where people have started them, done a half a dozen episodes. And when, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=391.56s)]
*  Elliot, I think we're into the eighties or nineties now in molecules marketing, I suppose what was, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=395.8s)]
*  what it coincided with the launch was COVID. And that was obviously unintentional given what [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  happened. But when the pandemic hit, events stopped, people couldn't get out and about. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=409.32s)]
*  Obviously there was virtual events and all that type of stuff. But actually what we found was [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=416.44s)]
*  people were trying to get their fix of industry insight and personalities and what's going on and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=421.08000000000004s)]
*  keep their pulse on the space. And the podcast just hit, was it the right place, right time? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  And it's like anything. And it's like in my businesses watching the emergence of digital [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=433.48s)]
*  technologies, events are not what they probably were 20 years ago. And there is a much younger [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=438.6s)]
*  audience coming into our industry. I found that last week that I'm just a millennial, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=445.96s)]
*  which surprised me. And that was, I was born in the early eighties and I was a 40 year old, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=452.91999999999996s)]
*  that shocked me. But there's a generation who are in their thirties that will get all of their [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=458.84s)]
*  information from podcasts. And that's no different to the industry that we operate in. So it was [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=464.67999999999995s)]
*  luck in that sense that the podcast managed to grow, the platform tried to grow quite quickly [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=470.35999999999996s)]
*  and surprisingly. And then it's kind of a snowball after that because you then get guests [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=475.0s)]
*  asking to come on and rather than you having to go out and find guests, which is often the challenge. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=479.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is a ton of fun. And kudos to guys like you and me who have the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=485.56s)]
*  stick-to-it-iveness to see this thing through, because you're right. We host on Buzzsprout, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=491.0s)]
*  for instance, and I think they host like, I don't know, half a million or so podcasts. And [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=496.68s)]
*  many of them are, you know, have come and they were gone sooner, quicker than they came, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=502.6s)]
*  I should say. So yeah, it's an excellent medium. And so when you're thinking about, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=508.44s)]
*  I want to ask you, like, when you're thinking about the sponsor organizations, my audience, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=515.0s)]
*  for instance, the leaders of New and Emerging, you know, pre to early stage clinical [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=520.52s)]
*  biopharma companies and beyond, but that's the bulk. A podcast like Molecule to Market that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=525.4799999999999s)]
*  is focused on that outsourcing space. What, you know, what, I guess, what takeaways, what benefits [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=533.3199999999999s)]
*  do sponsor companies get from these conversations? And I want to give you a little bit of context [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  into that question. And we'll talk a little bit about the CDMO space, because when I spend time [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=546.04s)]
*  talking with biopharma leaders, generally, I get an either or kind of take on outsourcers, like, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=550.84s)]
*  yeah, we couldn't do what we do without outsourcing partners, because we don't, maybe [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=559.64s)]
*  don't have the capital to build our own manufacturing capacity or the desire to do that. Or, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=566.12s)]
*  you know, we'd never work with an outsourcing partner because, and then fill in the blank, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=572.12s)]
*  because what we do is far too sophisticated, and we don't trust anyone else to do it, or [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=577.88s)]
*  the wait times are just way too long, or, you know, we can't trust our supply chain to a third party. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=582.92s)]
*  So kind of with that in mind, you know, I guess that kind of, that kind of, I guess, sentiment, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=590.84s)]
*  what is, what would be the advantage, what would be the advantage of tuning into these [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=598.04s)]
*  conversations about outsourcing with the outsourcing space with your guests? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=602.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a great, it's a great question. And I suppose [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=607.4000000000001s)]
*  outsourcing and its by very nature is quite broad. So I suspect all of your listeners will outsource [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=611.8800000000001s)]
*  something, whatever that might be, that could be medical communications, it could be preclinical, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=620.7600000000001s)]
*  it could be manufacturing, it could be logistics. The chances of one of your listeners doing [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=626.6s)]
*  everything in-house is very unlikely. What I would say is the value in tuning in, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=631.32s)]
*  particularly for anyone that's, I suppose, responsible for outsourcing or involved in [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=637.08s)]
*  the supply chain, or involved in procuring services in vendors, and so they'll be able to, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=642.84s)]
*  they'll be able to see the world through another set of eyes, which, you know, like anything in life [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=649.24s)]
*  is that kind of empathetic ability in nature often makes you a better, you know, whatever [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=653.96s)]
*  it's a person or an organization when you know the challenges. And also, I think just having your [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=661.0s)]
*  ear to the ground of new technologies, of new organizations and all that type of stuff. I think [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=666.52s)]
*  certainly in the CDMO space, one of the observations I've made is, you know, a lot of the emerging [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=671.64s)]
*  biotech and biopharma companies might, they'll default to the big CDMOs often, right, because [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=677.0s)]
*  they don't know any different. And that's where you get some of the challenges that you've met [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=685.24s)]
*  there, which are crazy lead times, you know, high prices, you know, all that, you know, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=689.0s)]
*  almost a sense of being a tiny fish in a big pond. And the, particularly the CDMO market is a very [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=693.4s)]
*  fragmented space. And it's probably the same for most elements and most segments within outsourcing. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=702.36s)]
*  And so I think exposure to other potential partners in the sector is a positive thing, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=707.88s)]
*  and just getting an understanding of how these organizations work and what their challenges are. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=714.04s)]
*  Because whatever way you look at it, if you look at the types of, you know, what if it's orphan [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=719.08s)]
*  drugs, personalized medicines, selling gene therapy drugs, all these types of modern, sophisticated, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=722.84s)]
*  current state technologies and medicines come into the fore will probably require some form [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=730.3599999999999s)]
*  of outsourcing. So in my opinion, I think it's useful to have that take from that audience of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  what's going on in their world. It's probably no different. It's almost like, you know, why would [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=744.5999999999999s)]
*  an investor audience listen to your podcast? Because often your audience is probably selling [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=749.8s)]
*  to the investors. But I tell you what, they'll make them better investors if they listen to your [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=756.04s)]
*  podcast. And I think it's a similar knock on effect. Yeah, the investment community was, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't want to say entirely unanticipated by catch, right? But we do catch a lot of the [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=766.68s)]
*  investment community. Matter of fact, I have a lot of investor response in many cases has been like, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=773.16s)]
*  how much do these companies pay to be featured on your podcast? I'm like, oh, they don't pay [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=780.04s)]
*  anything. Like I ask them what I want to ask them. And they're like, well, it's an awfully nice [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=783.72s)]
*  opportunity for them. You know, I try to steer them away from the JP Morgan pitch deck approach, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=787.48s)]
*  right? You know, we want it to be a commercial, but I get their interest. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=792.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's interesting to say that, so do I. You know, I say to my guests before they come on, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=797.8000000000001s)]
*  say, look, in a sense, you can promote what you want, but it's going to make people switch off, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=801.72s)]
*  right? Like, and I ask guests to think about, I spend quite a lot of time on each episode. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=806.52s)]
*  Understanding the person and understanding their personal journey. And the reason I do that is [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=813.72s)]
*  often whatever the end result is, it's something that very proud of and something that they want [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=819.0s)]
*  to share with their family and friends and colleagues, because it has that personable, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=822.44s)]
*  authentic nature. And I think whatever that medium is, whether it's podcasts or TV shows or radio, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=826.6800000000001s)]
*  personal stories and anecdotes are just powerful. Like we love stories. But at the same time, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=832.76s)]
*  I'll ask about trends and technologies and what's happening and what they're seeing in the market. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=839.08s)]
*  Tips around leadership and things like this. And actually what we try and steer away from is, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=844.12s)]
*  oh, you know, we are a CRO that does X-Files. People can find your website and look at that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=848.44s)]
*  stuff. So I think you're bang on to, you know, from an investor perspective as well to just, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=854.6800000000001s)]
*  you know, avoid the big decks and kind of sell it, the sales pitch. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=860.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You've been running around the outsourcing space since 07, 08. Is that about right? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=865.2399999999999s)]
*  Maybe even before. It might have been 2005 was my first ever kind of flotation. Even before that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=875.2399999999999s)]
*  might have been 2004 actually that I stumbled across this space. Yeah. So let's talk, let's [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=882.4399999999999s)]
*  talk shop a little bit about like what's different now from the way it was then, how it's sort of [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=888.76s)]
*  the dynamic of the industry and how it's impacting sponsor companies. Yeah. I mean, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=894.92s)]
*  sorry. I mean, I suppose at a very basic level, it's a lot more, I'd say it's a lot more sophisticated [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=901.16s)]
*  and it's a lot more global. It is hugely advanced than say 15, 20 years ago. You know, in those days [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=907.0799999999999s)]
*  it was predominantly small molecule. The majority of the market was dominated by small molecule [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=920.76s)]
*  API and finished dosage forms. And to your point earlier on, anything more sophisticated and fancy [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=926.4399999999999s)]
*  was done in-house because no one wanted to hand over their IP to a partner. And I think times [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=932.68s)]
*  have moved on. And certainly now from what I see is the growth of the sector has been phenomenal [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=937.48s)]
*  in all aspects. And that has been driven by your audience, right? Like whatever way you look at it, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=945.88s)]
*  the outsourcing space lives and dies by what's being thrown over the fence from big pharma, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=951.8s)]
*  from biotech companies, from bio pharma companies of all shapes and sizes. And you know, that's, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=960.6s)]
*  that's fueled the growth. It's fueled the investment. I mean, you would have seen yourself [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=966.84s)]
*  in the last few years, the level of M&A activity in the outsourcing space is off the scale. It's, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=970.36s)]
*  you know, I know one of my investor kind of connections said it was, they deemed it as one [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=977.0s)]
*  of the most investable sectors in the world right now. And you can kind of see why when you look at [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=982.04s)]
*  the tailwinds in the sector and COVID kind of added fuel to that fire as well, because that [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=987.4s)]
*  certainly had an impact as well. So, you know, in a sense, it's a very different kind of space. And [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=992.44s)]
*  one of the things I would say is, I think 15, 20 years ago, it's quite transactional kind of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=999.56s)]
*  relationship. And it's funny, because I've heard quite a lot of guests talk about this as well, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1005.7199999999999s)]
*  who've been in the industry for a while. It was kind of like, you know, vendor and buyer, right? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1009.4s)]
*  And you know, you are our supplier, you are producing X. And I think, you know, those were [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1013.88s)]
*  in the days where majorities were CMOs, it was before the D in the CDMO appeared, for example. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  And what I think's happened in that time is just, it's definitely moved along that spectrum to be [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1024.12s)]
*  less transactional and more partnership based. And, you know, how can companies collaborate and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1029.8799999999999s)]
*  work better and add value? And it's still a very competitive market space. So there is lots of [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1036.12s)]
*  opportunity for your audience to kind of engage with different companies and look for new [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1041.3999999999999s)]
*  technologies. And yeah, it is a very exciting time, I have to say, you know, it's been a very [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1045.8799999999999s)]
*  solid six, seven years in the outsourcing space. And I certainly feel very grateful to [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1051.24s)]
*  stumble into this sector and spend my entire career in it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1057.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And it is, I mean, you mentioned M&A, the sort of representative of the growth in the [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1062.44s)]
*  space, but even organic growth, man, it seems like, I don't know that honestly, I'm not [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1069.0s)]
*  exaggerating. I don't know that two days go by without a release crossing my desk about, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1073.56s)]
*  you know, ground being broken on a new outsource manufacturing facility [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1079.72s)]
*  funded by, you know, any number of investors or companies. Yeah. There are a lot of holes being [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1084.3600000000001s)]
*  dug in the ground here in the States to create new manufacturing capacity and pharmaceuticals. So [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1089.72s)]
*  it is an incredible growth space. And like you, I feel fortunate to be in this space. I mean, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1095.64s)]
*  I don't know, the people, the personalities, the opportunities to learn [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1103.8000000000002s)]
*  the altruism. I mean, it's a wonderful place to be. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1109.4s)]
*  I totally agree. I totally agree. And I have worked in other sectors when I was younger and [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1112.92s)]
*  I have to find, I do find it a very, I'm going to say friendly, but that's probably too extreme. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1118.92s)]
*  Like there are much more cutthroat sectors out there, I would say, than this one. And there is [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1124.92s)]
*  always a desire to produce something that's going to help patients. Like everyone is united [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1131.3200000000002s)]
*  with that same goal. Clearly there's commercial considerations and, you know, all that, but [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1136.2s)]
*  having an industry that's ultimately united towards producing new medicines that are going [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1144.1200000000001s)]
*  to impact our families is always a good thing. And I don't think we should ever forget that. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1148.8400000000001s)]
*  For sure. And I think, you know, to bring it back to one of the trends that you mentioned, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1153.88s)]
*  that collaborative spirit is, it's presenting itself in the outsourcing space. To your point, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1157.64s)]
*  we're seeing hybrid models. We're seeing, you know, models where sponsor companies are [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1166.12s)]
*  plugging their senior leadership and shop floor expertise into the outsourcer's facility to work [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1173.08s)]
*  on their projects. All sorts of, I mean, it's sort of a, you know, there are unwritten rules, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1183.48s)]
*  right? Maybe not even rules is what I'm saying. Like there are all sorts of different models [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1189.32s)]
*  taking shape right now in terms of how sponsors and outsourcers are working together. And in a [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1193.96s)]
*  way, I mean, that's awesome. And it speaks to that collaborative spirit. It also kind of, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1198.92s)]
*  kind of in a way can maybe convolute or confuse the easy transactional, easy to understand [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1203.8s)]
*  transactional nature of the past. I mean, what are you seeing there around how, I guess, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1211.0s)]
*  sponsors are digesting? Are they even aware of the opportunities for, you know, co-work environments [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1217.16s)]
*  and hybridization? And I don't know what the buzzwords are for that concept, but how are they [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1223.56s)]
*  embracing that? Are they aware of it? How are the outsourcers remodeling their commercial model to [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1229.0s)]
*  accommodate that kind of relationship? Yeah, I think it's a really interesting topic, actually. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1238.52s)]
*  And it's funny because I definitely think there is a blurring of the lines happening at the minute, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1244.12s)]
*  which wasn't there 20 years ago. And what I mean by that is, you know, it's interesting, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1251.56s)]
*  you know, a lot of the big pharma companies are building facilities or are reusing existing [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1257.3999999999999s)]
*  facilities effectively as contract services now. So, you know, if you look at someone like [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1263.56s)]
*  Abbey Contract Manufacturing, does it, Sanofi has a business like that. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1269.8799999999999s)]
*  Pfizer Center One is one of the best CDMOs in the world. And it's a subset of obviously Pfizer and [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1274.12s)]
*  and I think what will be really interesting in the next few years is, will it go the other way? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1281.6399999999999s)]
*  And what I mean by that is, you know, some of the contract service providers are really big [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1287.1599999999999s)]
*  organizations now, multi, multi-billion dollar organizations. They have the means, they have the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1294.52s)]
*  knowledge, they have the capability to actually develop products. And I think what will be really [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1300.6s)]
*  interesting in the next few years is how, if we see any of those businesses try to almost morph [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1305.24s)]
*  into that customer base, I mean, that causes all kinds of potential IP conflict and all that type [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1311.16s)]
*  of thing. And so, you know, back to your point around hybrid kind of collaboration and how [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1316.6000000000001s)]
*  companies work closer together. The partnership thing is so important and it is if you are working [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1322.3600000000001s)]
*  on say a critical medicine with a very tight milestone to hit a clinical deadline or to hit [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1327.3200000000002s)]
*  commercial deadline. It's not, you know, you have to work closely with a partner together, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1333.48s)]
*  but there has to be that level of trust between the companies. And so it's going to be fascinating [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1339.0s)]
*  in the next few years to see those lines blur and see if, you know, in 20 years time, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1344.6s)]
*  Matt, you and I might be doing the same podcasts because they might be the same companies, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1351.56s)]
*  which is quite ironic because obviously, you know, where this all started, where outsourcing came [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1356.04s)]
*  from, if you go back, you know, 30, 40 years ago, which was, you know, companies building [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1361.72s)]
*  facilities for clinical trials, not using them and thinking, well, that was an absolute waste [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1366.92s)]
*  of money. There's probably a better way of doing this. Let's find a contract manufacturer who can [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1370.3600000000001s)]
*  do it. So, I mean, the kind of full circle of life. So it is quite funny. Yeah. And it's business. I [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1375.0800000000002s)]
*  mean, at the end of the day, it's business. You know, you're just talking about we maybe [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1382.28s)]
*  maybe run in the same, but we'll co-host, let's make a pact. If it comes to that, you and I will co-host [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1386.76s)]
*  100%. The Business of Biotech Molecule to Market Podcast, or if you prefer the Molecule to Market [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1391.3200000000002s)]
*  Business of Biotech. But, you know, a company I've had, Tim Miller, the CEO at Forge Biologics, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1397.4s)]
*  is a company that comes to mind. You know, they started out as a company that intended to address [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1404.92s)]
*  a specific indication and build a therapy for it. And, you know, it's business. A smart way to fund [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1409.3200000000002s)]
*  that was, hey, we have enough money to build some manufacturing capacity. Let's, you know, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1415.4s)]
*  rent it out. Right? Like, well, that's the company's gone insane. I mean, they're building like crazy [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1421.1599999999999s)]
*  and now they're, you know, first and foremost, an outsource manufacturing partner and just happens [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1428.04s)]
*  to be working on a proprietary pipeline as well. So just one example, but exactly what you're saying. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1433.8s)]
*  All right. Let's talk just for a few minutes about some of the challenges in the space. I don't want [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1439.9599999999998s)]
*  to get your take on those and then we'll shift gears a little bit. But, you know, as I mentioned, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1444.12s)]
*  the sort of mixed emotions around lead times, there's everyone, whether you're doing things [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1449.88s)]
*  in-house or outsourcing right now, everyone's affected by supply chain constraints in API, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1455.88s)]
*  in consumables, you know, in single use technologies. Let's start with those. How, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1463.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, just generally, how is the outsourcing community reconciling those challenges? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1471.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's interesting because what you said before around, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1479.48s)]
*  there's a lot of breaking ground happening in North America. And I think [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1483.4s)]
*  there's been a few, there's been a lot of challenges in the space in the last few years, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1489.5600000000002s)]
*  and it's been driven by a few kind of key factors. And, you know, whatever way you look at it, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1493.72s)]
*  there isn't enough capacity and capability in the outsourcing space to actually meet the demand [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1498.8400000000001s)]
*  of drug sponsors at the minute. The US in particular is quite an interesting place because [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1504.1200000000001s)]
*  actually over the last 20, 30 years, more and more US businesses have been sent to Asia in terms of [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1510.28s)]
*  you look at API manufacturing, for example. COVID then hits and it left North America and actually [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1517.56s)]
*  Europe quite exposed, I would say, from a capabilities and capacity perspective, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1525.56s)]
*  which in turn obviously makes for vulnerable supply chains for the bio-pharma kind of big [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1529.88s)]
*  pharma industry. And I think you throw into that mix the geopolitical challenges of, you know, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1535.8000000000002s)]
*  not just COVID in terms of transporting things and supply chains, but also just, you know, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1543.8000000000002s)]
*  what's happening in Europe at the minute is, you know, you've got instability just makes for a very [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1547.96s)]
*  exposed and vulnerable supply chain. So I think some of these challenges are definitely [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1553.24s)]
*  contributing to what we're seeing in terms of kind of movement in the space at the minute, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1559.16s)]
*  which are definitely seeing redeployment of supply back to the West. You know, this was a trend that [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1563.3200000000002s)]
*  was talked about early on in COVID, but the more and more people I speak to, the more and more [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1571.16s)]
*  I'm seeing this being a real thing where proximity of supply is becoming quite important to [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1575.48s)]
*  drug sponsors. So, you know, 10 years ago, they might have sent everything to [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1583.72s)]
*  somewhere else in the world. And actually, there's almost a nervousness there around, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1590.6s)]
*  well, what happens if we have another pandemic? What happens if a boat gets stuck somewhere else [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1596.1999999999998s)]
*  in the world? What happens if things escalate in Europe? What's that going to mean for particularly [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1601.32s)]
*  in North America? What's that going to mean for our supply chain? So we've seen some interesting [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1607.32s)]
*  things around, you know, whether it's redeployment of redistribution from kind of East to West. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1611.0s)]
*  The other thing I think which is quite interesting, the kind of challenge there is just, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1615.56s)]
*  and I think this is important for the kind of the bio-pharma listeners of yours is almost building, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1620.84s)]
*  strategically building resiliency into their outsourcing models. So for example, you know, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1629.4s)]
*  could they have a contingency outsource? Could they have a contingency vendor in place? Could they [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1635.32s)]
*  have another supplier elsewhere in the world kind of set up? And, you know, it's all, and then that's [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1640.44s)]
*  having a knock on effect, if that makes sense, because, you know, say you have a biosec company [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1646.6000000000001s)]
*  that cannot miss its clinical milestone, and they've got two CDMOs set up, right? Those CDMOs then [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1650.92s)]
*  have multiple API and excipient suppliers and packaging suppliers and everything that sits [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1657.24s)]
*  underneath that. And then they've got multiple suppliers because no one wants to miss. So [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1662.2s)]
*  I think the complexity around supply chain of vulnerability is a massive challenge at the minute, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1668.68s)]
*  and, you know, what doesn't help is obviously the costs of doing anything at the cost of transport, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1673.6399999999999s)]
*  inflation, salaries, interest rates, everything is on the rise, and I think that that makes for [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1680.36s)]
*  kind of more challenges. And so back to your earlier conversation, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1685.32s)]
*  risk sharing, risk mitigation, and actually just working closely together, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1692.52s)]
*  I think in a more proactive way, I think everything I've just mentioned there was reactive to [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1696.84s)]
*  what happened during the pandemic, and I think companies should be taking a much more proactive [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1702.6s)]
*  view on, you know, we can't predict every eventuality, right? We can't predict [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1708.1999999999998s)]
*  if there's going to be another outbreak of war, if there's going to be, you know, another epidemic or [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1711.8799999999999s)]
*  pandemic, but what we can do is we have enough history now to see, you know, we know what things [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1717.32s)]
*  could happen, and let's get ready for these things. So I would certainly encourage your [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1722.28s)]
*  listeners to be proactive about that kind of risk mitigation and supply chain security piece, because [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1728.12s)]
*  things are going to go down, things are going to be challenging. The reasons could be anything, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1734.84s)]
*  but nevertheless, just trying to work closely with vendors and outsource partners in the space, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1742.36s)]
*  and having those open conversations around like, how do we build in a kind of, you know, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1748.36s)]
*  almost like supply chain security, but you know, like quality by design, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1754.04s)]
*  but for supply chain, I think is really important. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1757.0s)]
*  When you're striving to excel in a new arena, the best guides are the ones already doing it well. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1762.6s)]
*  The business of biotech brings those voices forward to help new and emerging biopharmers [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1768.1999999999998s)]
*  turn their innovations, like mRNA and cell and gene therapies, into clinical realities. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1772.76s)]
*  Tune in and subscribe for insights on hiring, regulatory, and other need-to-know topics for [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1779.0s)]
*  biopharma leaders. The podcast is brought to you in collaboration with Cytiva. Check out their [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1783.8799999999999s)]
*  resources at Cytiva.com backslash emerging biotech. That's C-Y-T-I-V-A.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1790.12s)]
*  Yeah, all right. One more challenge I want to throw at you to get your take on. You mentioned [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1801.08s)]
*  earlier, we were talking a little bit about the synergy between our audiences, right? Like the [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1805.56s)]
*  biopharma sponsor audience is what's driving this incredible and unprecedented growth in [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1810.12s)]
*  outsource manufacturing. It has been for quite some time, although in the last 12, 18 months, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1817.48s)]
*  a lot of that early stage innovation, a lot of those early stage companies are struggling, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1827.32s)]
*  pretty mightily from a capital market standpoint, right? A cash runway standpoint. We're seeing a [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1834.36s)]
*  lot of innovation die on the vine as emerging biopharma companies either shut down specific [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1839.3999999999999s)]
*  candidates or go completely belly up because they're running out of cash and it's difficult [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1848.36s)]
*  to go out and procure cash right now. Which is, it's disappointing from an innovation standpoint. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1854.2s)]
*  It's also a little bit scary from an economic standpoint because a lot of these emerging [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1863.16s)]
*  companies are sort of the innovators, the sources of innovation, and also the future of these [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1869.48s)]
*  therapies. So what impact, I guess, do you anticipate that might have? Assuming it's even [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1875.88s)]
*  a little bit protracted, is that kind of restriction in capital markets, shortening cash [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1883.88s)]
*  runways, kind of a bare biopharma investment market right now dampening the growth or will [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1890.6s)]
*  it dampen the growth of the outsourcing space? I mean, it's such a good question because it's [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1897.9599999999998s)]
*  such a doubt. I feel like I just sucked the air out of the room with that. Well, I mean, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1904.36s)]
*  the reality is exactly what you said there. All the numbers indicate that funding is down, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1910.28s)]
*  investors are looking to invest their money elsewhere. And whatever way you look at it, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1918.3600000000001s)]
*  that's going to be less funding coming into the sector. So what it means is the biopharma [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1924.68s)]
*  businesses are going to have to learn to operate with less. Now, in my business experience, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1931.4s)]
*  some of the best creativity came when we didn't have anything or when we had very little. So [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1937.32s)]
*  from being resourceful can often come great creativity and create innovation. And so [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1942.68s)]
*  the sector has had it pretty good for a long time. It's okay to tighten the belt every so often and [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1950.76s)]
*  be like, okay, let's think about how we do things in a slightly more cost effective way. I mean, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1958.68s)]
*  the amount of people jumping jobs at the minute, the salaries being offered, it's just insane. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1964.8400000000001s)]
*  It's just absolutely insane. I have a recruitment business as well, and I can see what kinds of [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1970.1200000000001s)]
*  salaries are being asked for and stuff like that. And that will not last forever because companies [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1977.0800000000002s)]
*  just can't continue to afford it, especially if the capital markets kind of start with the cash [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1982.3600000000001s)]
*  starts drying up. So my take on it is I think biopharma companies by their very nature are often [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1987.0s)]
*  entrepreneurial. They're often got great leadership teams and they'll find a way to innovate because [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=1995.32s)]
*  they always have done. And I have real confidence in the sector to be able to do that. And the knock [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2001.96s)]
*  on effect actually for the outsourcing space might be bizarrely that even more is outsourced, which [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2008.9199999999998s)]
*  sounds like a contradiction in terms. But if you take a biotech company with say it's got 500 staff, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2015.48s)]
*  right? And if you look at that staff count and say, well, there are 300 overhead within that team [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2023.0s)]
*  that could be outsourced instead. There are another 50 that are nice to have type staff. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2029.72s)]
*  You could see a model, which is a slightly more on the lines of the virtual biotech model, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2037.4s)]
*  which is much leaner. And actually all that does is outsource more because everything's done on a [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2041.16s)]
*  needs must basis. So in that sense, I think it's difficult to predict what the impact's going to be [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2046.84s)]
*  on the outsourcing space because just because there's less money in the sector doesn't mean [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2054.04s)]
*  they're going to outsource less. If for anything, if it was my business, I would have less fixed [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2058.68s)]
*  overhead and I would outsource more. So that's the, I suppose the conundrum for the outsourcing space, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2063.7999999999997s)]
*  whether the stick or twist on this. And on the whole, the market is still up versus two or three [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2069.64s)]
*  years ago. 2021 might have been a bit of a freak year. It's funny, I'm watching the biotech market [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2075.64s)]
*  and I'm looking at the housing market across particularly the US and the UK where I spend most [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2083.3199999999997s)]
*  of my time. And then I'm almost like identical. Like they're so high at the minute and any drop [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2087.56s)]
*  and it's like, oh my God, it's doom and gloom. But actually if you look at a, you step back and you [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2095.3199999999997s)]
*  bring that lens to a 10 year, 20 year picture, this is a very vibrant time for the property market [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2102.52s)]
*  and for the biotech space. So I think we just have to be mindful of not taking it out of context [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2108.44s)]
*  too much, which is, you know, 2021 was a very positive year for the biotech funding and that [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2113.88s)]
*  no doubt had an impact on outsourcing. But innovation has to happen. We are on, you know, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2118.84s)]
*  there's so many exciting drug platforms and technologies that are coming through. I mean, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2125.48s)]
*  the vaccine work we've just seen in recent years, just the tip of the iceberg of some of the kind of [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2130.52s)]
*  patient-serving medicines that are going to come to market. So we have to find ways of getting those [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2139.0s)]
*  to market and outsourcing space has to step up and actually risk share and help the drug [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2143.64s)]
*  developers as much as possible. So that'll be interesting to see if that happens in the next [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2150.04s)]
*  few years. Yeah. Yeah. That risk sharing and assistance with drug development kind of gets [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2154.12s)]
*  back to that. Some of those blurred lines we talked about a little bit and I've always kind of been, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2158.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know, the outsourcing space from an editorial coverage perspective on Bioprocess [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2164.6s)]
*  online as well as on this podcast has always presented a bit of a conundrum to me in that [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2171.24s)]
*  we view outsourcers as vendors slash suppliers and I don't as a matter of practice interview [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2178.7599999999998s)]
*  vendors slash suppliers, right? I interview sponsors and biopharma innovators and leaders of [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2186.84s)]
*  therapeutic development companies. Yet at the same time, like I look at the outsourcing space and I [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2193.08s)]
*  know a lot of people in the outsourcing space that I talk to and respect, I just don't necessarily [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2198.92s)]
*  write about them. On a few rare occasions, I have had outsourcing execs on the show and enjoy the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2203.8s)]
*  conversations immensely, but it's very difficult to keep them reined in. It's very difficult to, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2209.96s)]
*  yeah, to your point, you made the point earlier. I have to police the commercialization aspect of [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2216.2000000000003s)]
*  those conversations, but I feel like I'm missing something there too because [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2225.96s)]
*  a good portion of our audience is technical and scientific in nature. They do want content on [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2230.92s)]
*  you know, facilities design, equipment design, modularity, best practices and continuous [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2238.92s)]
*  process and continuous manufacturing. And when I ask the CEO or co-founder of a preclinical or [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2245.7200000000003s)]
*  phase one biopharma company about those things, oftentimes the response is, you know, I don't know, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2255.0800000000004s)]
*  you have to talk to our outsource manufacturer. We know what they're doing. We kind of monitor [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2260.52s)]
*  that, but like it's not our bailiwick. We run the business. We do the development. We do the [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2265.08s)]
*  discovery, that kind of thing. So, you know, it's tough for me because so much of that body of [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2268.92s)]
*  technical and facilities knowledge begins and lives in that outsourcing space. So, yeah, maybe [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2275.56s)]
*  again, maybe you and I will be co-hosting a podcast. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2287.48s)]
*  Yeah, but you make an interesting point around innovation and I think we're seeing more and more [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2291.32s)]
*  innovation coming out of the outsourcing space to be able to better cater for and support [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2300.68s)]
*  biopharma companies. And so that can only be a good thing. And to your point there, you know, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2307.08s)]
*  isn't it great when you speak to a, you know, a therapeutic company that has a relationship [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2312.68s)]
*  with a partner that says, hey, we trust them. We just got, you know, we know they got it. Like [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2317.16s)]
*  that's like in anything in life, any partnership or relationship and like having that trust for [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2321.48s)]
*  a partner is ultimately what you look for when you engage with anyone. So I think that [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2327.3999999999996s)]
*  outsourcing space does have a responsibility to innovate and find [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2335.72s)]
*  ways to do things differently. And you mentioned it before as well, you know, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2340.2799999999997s)]
*  not, you have only a certain amount of space. If you take a facility, there's only a certain [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2343.32s)]
*  amount of space or a certain amount of resources they have to play with. So they're going to have [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2347.7200000000003s)]
*  to become cleverer with using the resource and being able to build their businesses and yet [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2351.6400000000003s)]
*  continue to add value to the biopharma space. But it's funny. I mean, I, I, I wear the exact [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2357.2400000000002s)]
*  opposite because I typically don't have your type of listener on my show, not because of anything, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2363.48s)]
*  you know, that's wrong with your listener. Clearly not because the, you know, very key leaders of the [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2370.44s)]
*  space and driving innovation and therapeutics and stuff like that. But at the same time, you know, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2376.28s)]
*  it's, it is, it has been quite good every so often to have like a buyer. So we had, we had the head [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2381.1600000000003s)]
*  of outsourcing for Bayer Pharma in North America on, he was great. We had about a couple of biotech [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2387.32s)]
*  companies on, we had Made Pharma, which is an Australian listed Australian company that had [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2392.52s)]
*  outsourcing for their businesses. And it's fascinating getting the other side of the coin. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2398.84s)]
*  And I suppose what's more difficult for you is they aren't selling anything. Whereas when you [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2404.84s)]
*  get vendors on, it's going to be hard for them not to be like, Oh, by the way, we have this new [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2410.28s)]
*  technology or whatever. And, but you know, there are some interesting people around you. You know, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2415.1600000000003s)]
*  I suppose you've had Alan, Alan Shaw on your podcast a couple of times, he's a fantastic guy [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2420.84s)]
*  for soundbites. I think we've just had him, I interviewed him a couple of weeks, so I think [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2426.44s)]
*  it's going to be on our podcast soon. And we've borrowed them from you guys. I definitely did tell [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2430.28s)]
*  you. No, you may have told me you're going after him. As a matter of fact, I think I helped [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2436.76s)]
*  facilitate that. I'm just saying, Alan, I don't know that Alan told me that he's committed. So [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2441.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm going to have to have a conversation about that. You're going to enjoy that one. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2446.28s)]
*  You want to? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2450.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, and what I was saying is, you know, for example, we've had someone like Jim Miller, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2451.88s)]
*  who's been in the outsourcing space for 34 years, and he's not there to sell anything. He's there [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2456.2s)]
*  just to give his perspective on what's happening in the space. And so even for your guests, that [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2461.56s)]
*  type of insight might be quite helpful where it's less, that's promotional. That's just. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2467.4s)]
*  Yeah, it is. It is almost impossible in the on those rare occasions that I've had [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2473.96s)]
*  execs from the outsourcing space on this show, I've made it a point to strategically [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2478.76s)]
*  invite them and one of their sponsor customers, right? So we could talk more specifically about [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2485.96s)]
*  that sponsor's business, therapies they're developing, and get those multiple perspectives, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2490.5200000000004s)]
*  which I do think are valuable. I'm not certainly in no way because I call outsourcers, vendors, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2495.48s)]
*  or suppliers, I'm not discounting their, you know, the value they bring to the conversation. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2500.36s)]
*  But even in those cases where I have them on with a sponsor, you know, the sponsor will do their [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2507.0s)]
*  part, which is always great. And then inevitably, when they start talking about how they came to, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2511.72s)]
*  you know, their working relationship and contracted and worked together and the services they provide, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2516.2s)]
*  you know, they can't do it without promoting, right? So, you know, speaking of these [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2521.08s)]
*  transactional relationships in Biofarm, I wanted to talk briefly about your agency, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2531.88s)]
*  because you guys just, you just recently had a sort of a transactional relationship with your own [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2541.08s)]
*  at Raw Marketing. Yeah, and I found that unique, you know, you and I have similar backgrounds, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2547.88s)]
*  like going way back prior to our current industry, in that, you know, I worked in, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2554.84s)]
*  sort of worked as sort of a generalist, mark-on person for a while at a couple of different [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2562.2000000000003s)]
*  agencies. And I know that space quite well, obviously, I interact with agencies all the [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2567.48s)]
*  time in my current capacity as an editor and podcast host. And it's not, especially in the, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2571.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, small to midsize agency realm, it's not a place where you often see a whole lot of, like, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2578.52s)]
*  you know, capital investment news or private equity news. But yeah, Raw Marketing just recently [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2584.36s)]
*  went the P.E. route, right? Yeah, that's right. Which is unique. I mean, it's unique for an agency, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2591.4s)]
*  isn't it? Maybe it's not over there, but I think it's pretty unique over here. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2597.2400000000002s)]
*  It is unusual, you know, and, you know, remarketing is trying not to be promotional now, given that, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2601.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, we've, we've, we've built the business, obviously, over the last 13 years. And, you know, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2607.56s)]
*  I founded it from my, you know, from a small apartment in the northeast of England, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2613.08s)]
*  with no expectation of what it was going to become as an organization. And, you know, as we, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2618.68s)]
*  as the outsourcing, and we, you know, we primarily work with companies in the outsourcing space, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2624.68s)]
*  that's where we have caught our teeth in. You know, we'll often get big pharma companies and [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2628.92s)]
*  biotech companies knocking on our door, and we'll be like, we don't really do stuff you want. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2634.12s)]
*  And they're always kind of quizzically looking at us scratching our heads being what? You don't [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2639.3199999999997s)]
*  want our dollars. And we know, we stick to our niche, and that's, that's worked well for the [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2643.56s)]
*  business. And as the market has grown, and our reputation has grown, and we opened, obviously, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2649.0s)]
*  an office in Boston a few years ago as well, that helped accelerate the growth of the business as [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2655.0s)]
*  well. And, you know, as a, as a founder, you get to a point where you need, it's kind of, you need [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2659.3199999999997s)]
*  to do something because your entire, or the big, a big portion of your, you know, your wealth and [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2665.4s)]
*  your kind of everything that you've built up is just wrapped up in an organization. And that [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2671.4s)]
*  business is not going to slow down, it's going to continue to grow. So it felt like a good opportunity [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2676.76s)]
*  for me personally to de-risk slightly, but also bring a private equity partner in that can just [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2681.64s)]
*  help us navigate where we're going in the future from, you know, their learnings and experiences. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2688.2000000000003s)]
*  Back to what you said, Matt, it is quite unusual. I've been contacted quite a lot in the last couple [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2693.64s)]
*  of months from agency owners kind of saying, how the hell did you do that? And, you know, and, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2698.04s)]
*  you know, what, you know, we've built a good business, you know, we've built a fast growing [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2703.4s)]
*  business. We're in a specific niche. It's a global market. You know, we, you know, and I'm not saying [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2708.12s)]
*  it was all accidental or all by design. It was probably somewhere in between. And, you know, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2713.32s)]
*  there was a lot of private equity money out there at the minute, you know, globally. And so, you know, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2719.32s)]
*  we managed to find a partner in North Edge that is invested in life sciences, but particularly [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2724.6800000000003s)]
*  people-based businesses. They loved what we were doing and there's a real good culture fit there. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2729.56s)]
*  And, you know, it's, you know, a few months in, it's so far so good and, you know, good relationship [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2734.76s)]
*  there. And it's, it's growth for me, right? Because it's also because this is the next phase of my own [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2740.04s)]
*  personal career as well in terms of what, you know, when you're a founder, you kind of, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2744.44s)]
*  you always wonder what it's like having investors around the table and all that kind of stuff. So [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2750.04s)]
*  it is a slightly different situation for me personally, but one I'm really enjoying and, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2754.28s)]
*  yeah, very ambitious and excited for the future. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2759.16s)]
*  Rod Karr Yeah. Well, congratulations on that. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2761.7200000000003s)]
*  Chris Thank you. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2763.8s)]
*  Rod Karr Yeah. To your point, most of the agencies that I know, even the ones that are big now [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2764.92s)]
*  started the way that you started, but kind of stayed there. It was all, you know, bootstrapping, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2770.2s)]
*  begging, maybe borrowing a little bit, but that's really cool. It's good news. And you guys, you [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2774.04s)]
*  know, your growth is, it's exciting to watch, you know, the culture that you've created at the agency [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2780.4399999999996s)]
*  kind of, it exudes, you know, in your social media posts and your website. It's clearly a unique [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2787.96s)]
*  place to work. And I know a lot of that is kind of wrapped up or built on [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2795.72s)]
*  your experiences as you've kind of grown and maybe bumped and bruised your knees a little bit along [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2802.12s)]
*  the way. And you capture a whole bunch of those bumps and scrapes and bruises in your book, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2811.4799999999996s)]
*  which I want to ask you about too. And this is a first, by the way, you know, I don't typically, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2818.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, take the folks who are hawking books on a book tour on the podcast, but I want to ask you [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2824.04s)]
*  about it. You published a book beginning of this year, was it? January? Yeah, that's right. It came [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2832.2s)]
*  out in the back end of January, it's called The Flounder and Founder. If you're watching the video [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2837.88s)]
*  version of this pod, it's over Raman's right shoulder and to his right, there you go. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2844.68s)]
*  It's always there. It's always there. So there you go. And yeah, no, it's, it's, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2849.32s)]
*  it was, you know, it's, it's made up of kind of 24 short lessons of how small service businesses [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2854.44s)]
*  that are stuck in a rut can kind of navigate their way forward. And it's as much about the [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2860.76s)]
*  business growth as it is about how to help founders navigate that growth. And it's very [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2865.2400000000002s)]
*  much based on my experience and quite literally all the mistakes I've made. I've made a ton of [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2870.76s)]
*  mistakes in the last 13 years. And there are things that I got wrong, which I can, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2876.04s)]
*  I've documented in a way that'll hopefully help other founders and entrepreneurs who are going [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2881.16s)]
*  through a similar journey. And, you know, in my experience, it can be very lonely when you, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2886.2799999999997s)]
*  when you start a business and you grow a business and it's hard to find people that understand what [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2893.48s)]
*  you're going through. And so I tried to capture quite a lot of that in that kind of empathetic [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2898.52s)]
*  excited things, but also tell it how it is and not, you know, not glitz it up too much. It's [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2903.4s)]
*  funny when you look at the Amazon reviews, it's the words honest and authentic and brutal keep [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2909.48s)]
*  coming. You know, you just keep popping up, which is kind of the tone that I wanted it, wanted to [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2914.92s)]
*  set in, you know, in as much of, and it's as much as I say about your businesses, you know, any [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2919.88s)]
*  entrepreneurs or founders, because what is odd, I find is when people start their own businesses, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2925.7200000000003s)]
*  they just stop investing in themselves. They get so consumed with the journey of the business [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2931.64s)]
*  that they don't go on courses. They don't listen to podcasts. They don't kind of, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2937.16s)]
*  they almost just stop learning and stop making time for themselves. So I managed to find some [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2940.6s)]
*  balance in that part of life. And I, you know, I put a lot of my personal success and actually [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2945.8799999999997s)]
*  in part than the business's success on down to the fact that I've managed to navigate [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2951.56s)]
*  personal growth at the same time. So I capture as much as that is possible in a very non-corporate [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2955.7999999999997s)]
*  kind of normal language type of way that ultimately gives founders some tools and techniques and [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2963.72s)]
*  insights and anecdotes that will hopefully help them on the journey. And, you know, I'm proud to [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2970.3599999999997s)]
*  say it was at the end of January, it was a bestseller in the US and UK and kind of in [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2974.2s)]
*  kind of entrepreneurship and kind of small business books in the US and in UK, which was, yeah, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2979.8799999999997s)]
*  a very proud moment I received. I haven't got it behind me, but I did receive something from [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2985.16s)]
*  a publisher. My publisher the other day, it's a beautiful framed picture, which I'll put on [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2988.2s)]
*  LinkedIn at some point, but yeah, it's been a really fun thing to do, quite honest, very, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2993.72s)]
*  very humbled by the feedback from people. And I got one guy message me a few months after it came [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=2997.8799999999997s)]
*  out and just said, he just sent me a lovely message on LinkedIn saying, I was really struggling. I [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3003.0s)]
*  came across your book. It's just given me fire in my belly to get over the challenges I'm going [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3007.56s)]
*  through. And honestly, I showed my wife, like, like Nelly wanted to cry, you know, watching this [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3011.96s)]
*  because, you know, it wasn't, you know, most people don't make money from books. It's not something [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3016.52s)]
*  you do to make money. You know, my intention was, I think I could capture something that can help [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3022.52s)]
*  people in the future. And it was just, it was really lovely to see that kind of genuine impact [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3028.36s)]
*  that I've made on someone's life. I didn't know the guy, I don't know where he lives or anything [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3035.7200000000003s)]
*  like that. And it's just nice to see you can help people elsewhere in the world. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3039.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's very cool. And it's sort of a, I guess I'd say, it's not like a horizontally [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3043.0s)]
*  focused book. Like it's not specific to founding any specific type of business. And I'm curious [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3048.8399999999997s)]
*  about that because, you know, there's value, right? In that book, I would presume for [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3053.48s)]
*  the significant portion of our audience who are founders of biopharma companies, who I think are [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3058.8399999999997s)]
*  prone to, prone perhaps to that mindset that you talked about where you become sort of, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3064.92s)]
*  you know, you withdraw almost to the point where you're still focused on, think about, you think [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3072.12s)]
*  about a founder of a biopharma company who's working on perhaps a piece of intellectual property [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3078.76s)]
*  that was acquired from academia. That's their life. Maybe they're a scientist to begin with. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3083.96s)]
*  Maybe they were involved in the discovery of that molecule. And there's a lot of work to be done, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3089.32s)]
*  in the discovery and development of that molecule as a potential therapeutic. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3095.1600000000003s)]
*  It's easy to put your head down, focus exclusively on that task and maybe building a team to [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3099.96s)]
*  tackle that task and kind of lose sight of not just yourself, but the world around you, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3106.36s)]
*  the space around you, the industry around you. I guess what, I mean, if you could draw maybe [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3111.1600000000003s)]
*  an anecdote or two that might be particularly compelling to this space, right? Founders in [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3115.7200000000003s)]
*  the space of therapeutic drug development. Yeah, you're right. You know, a lot of the [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3124.36s)]
*  learnings in the book, especially in the second half are relevant for any founder and leader [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3131.32s)]
*  of an organization. And so, you know, one of the things, and I think it's applicable [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3136.84s)]
*  to your audiences, you know, on the service side of things, not every client is a good client. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3141.96s)]
*  And you have to learn to say, no, you have to learn to recognize what is a good opportunity [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3148.6800000000003s)]
*  and what is a bad opportunity. And I think, you know, one of the tools I talk about is, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3153.32s)]
*  you know, in our business, we call it a defense checklist, right? We talk about, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3158.52s)]
*  if the potential buyer of our services demonstrates these types of behaviors or does this type of [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3163.8s)]
*  stuff, we walk away, we don't even let them in the gate. Now, I would argue for a biopharma leader, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3170.36s)]
*  you could do something like that for an investor audience, right? Like, not every investor is going [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3176.36s)]
*  to be a good investor. I'm sure most of your listeners have got scores they can share. And [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3181.8s)]
*  the other one, you know, is that learning from failure, right? Actually, you know, unfortunately, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3187.1600000000003s)]
*  the market we operate in does have lots of failures and actually learning from those mistakes. And [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3193.4s)]
*  sometimes if the sciences, the sciences work, right? But actually there are other areas in terms of [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3198.1200000000003s)]
*  who you recruit, you know, and how you lead a team and all that type of stuff, which I think [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3202.92s)]
*  you'll get wrong, they'll get hires wrong, and you'll get business relationships wrong. And I [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3206.84s)]
*  think, again, learning from those and taking the silver linings out of that. And one thing I would [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3211.48s)]
*  say for a biopharma audience and something you captured right at the start, you use the word [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3215.88s)]
*  enthusiastic. I get that all, I got that since I was a kid. It was like, when anyone couldn't say [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3220.28s)]
*  anything nice about me, they'd be like, oh my God, he's so full of energy and enthusiasm. That's [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3225.88s)]
*  it, right? And so, and what's really fascinating about that trait, it was once kind of like, oh my [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3230.28s)]
*  God, like everyone says that about me. And that's like, it's almost like the pat on the head, like, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3234.84s)]
*  all right, he's enthusiastic. But it's also, it's ended up being a superpower in terms of one of my [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3241.2400000000002s)]
*  traits when it comes to building culture and actually attracting people to the organization [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3248.84s)]
*  and all that type of stuff. And the reason I mention it is, I suspect most of the founders [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3254.04s)]
*  and business leaders and your listeners are, whether they're scientists or whether they're [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3258.04s)]
*  business people, that passion for what they do is so infectious in their organizations and [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3263.24s)]
*  recognizing that their role is to just keep doing that and set the tone and set that example. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3269.72s)]
*  And that helps build the tone of a culture in an organization. And, you know, we've managed to [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3275.8799999999997s)]
*  build a phenomenal culture in our organization. And I can't tell you how we did it. It's just [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3281.24s)]
*  happened. And our brand values are core to that in the way that we operate and the way that we [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3288.12s)]
*  deal with each other and respect each other. But a lot of it in my head is just setting that tone [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3292.92s)]
*  and setting that tone of responsiveness and enthusiasm and passion. And that's then the [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3297.56s)]
*  first five, 10 team members embody that. And then that's passed to the next 20 team members [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3303.7200000000003s)]
*  and 50 team members. And then it just kind of snowballs after that. So I think those would be [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3308.6s)]
*  some of the things that I would suggest, you know, whether people can get them from the book or just [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3312.92s)]
*  from this podcast today, is don't underestimate that passion and that kind of enthusiasm that [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3317.24s)]
*  you love, which makes your organization special or your technology special or your drugs product [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3324.8399999999997s)]
*  special or the unmet need you're trying to go after because of some personal reason. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3329.56s)]
*  That is just magic for culture and something to not underestimate. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3336.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's sound advice. And it's coming from a great place because you've proven it [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3341.48s)]
*  in all your endeavors. That enthusiasm has fueled a lot of projects out of ramen. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3349.4s)]
*  It annoys my wife as well. So there is a downside to everything. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3354.76s)]
*  I'll bet you put just as much energy and enthusiasm into being a husband and dad as you do a professional. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3361.8s)]
*  I try. I try. It's always a battle, isn't it? So but yeah, absolutely. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3368.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's tough. You got to make sure you're bringing, you know, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3373.0s)]
*  sometimes you feel like you take your best self and leave your best self at the office. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3376.44s)]
*  You got to make sure you bring some of that home now and then. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3380.6s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, couldn't agree more. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3383.0s)]
*  I had more on my agenda, Raman, but we're running short on time. So you might have to do a part two, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3385.4s)]
*  but I'm going to let you take it away with a concluding thought. I don't know. Take it wherever [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3391.08s)]
*  you want to take it. Give us a concluding thought. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3396.2s)]
*  Put you on the spot. I think my concluding thought for your listeners are, you know, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3400.8399999999997s)]
*  what I'd ask, you know, my podcast looks to promote and celebrate the outsourcing space. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3407.8799999999997s)]
*  And I think when you're thinking about your vendors and relationships with vendors, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3413.48s)]
*  beyond just capabilities and quality and capacity and all the kind of literal stuff, you know, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3418.8399999999997s)]
*  my advice to you is vendors change like biotech companies change, right? So the vendor on day one [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3424.3599999999997s)]
*  might be that same vendor might be very different in five years time because the market is changing [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3431.56s)]
*  so much. So continually assess your partnerships, explore new options on the market. Don't just go [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3436.2s)]
*  to the default options. And, you know, like anything in life, good relationships, meeting promises, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3445.64s)]
*  ability to build a relationship are just core to the kind of relationships that you build with your [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3452.44s)]
*  kind of vendor audience or your outsourcing partners. So that would be my kind of concluding [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3458.6s)]
*  things that keep an open mind and keep curious and exploring and make sure your teams are doing [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3464.04s)]
*  the same rather than thinking, you know, you mentioned before that, oh, you know, everyone [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3469.08s)]
*  has long lead times. I don't think that's the case. I think that's just lazy thinking from some [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3473.56s)]
*  people. And actually, there is always a way there is always companies that are hungry for business [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3478.84s)]
*  and hungry for opportunity. So my advice would go, you know, go Google them, go to events, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3483.88s)]
*  ask me whatever I'm more than happy to help. You know, anyone in the space, you know, like myself, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3489.4s)]
*  will be able to recommend people to have a conversation with. Nice. I love it when a guest [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3495.08s)]
*  calls BS on a, you know, tightly held industry belief that isn't necessarily true. That's perfect. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3500.28s)]
*  Yeah. So just to wrap things up, as I said, you're into a million different things and you can be [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3508.84s)]
*  found pretty much anywhere, but where's worse? What's the clearinghouse of Ramen Siegel? Is there [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3514.04s)]
*  if you want more information on the agency, the book, the podcast, the blogging, the, you know, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3519.0s)]
*  all of it, where do we get more Ramen Siegel? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3529.08s)]
*  So the Romansegell.com is my like, you know, my, I suppose, base for access to everything. But [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3531.64s)]
*  beyond that, you know, find me on on LinkedIn. And, you know, I'm pretty easy to find on LinkedIn. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3539.56s)]
*  Just look for my name. There's only a couple of us out there and yeah, please connect. It'd be great [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3544.3599999999997s)]

*  for the interviews and do the follow up and do the editing, the production and the publishing. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3559.32s)]
*  It's hard work. And, you know, we laugh and at the start about people that don't have [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3565.0s)]

*  Yeah, I'll do it. Just promise. Yeah. I don't have to follow Alan Shaw. As long as I don't have to [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_6jSmzOkbc&t=3597.64s)]
