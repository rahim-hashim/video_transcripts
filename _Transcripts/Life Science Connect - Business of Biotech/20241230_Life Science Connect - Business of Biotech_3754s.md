Video Description: Zandy Forbes, Ph.D. learned about business risk mitigation in the riskiest of business environments. She was a public markets healthcare investor on Wall Street for well more than a decade. Her hedge fund experience followed the Human Frontiers/Howard Hughes postdoctoral fellowship at the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center that was preceded by an Oxford Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics. Since 2015, she's been drawing from her immersion in both the business and science disciplines as President & CEO at Meira GTx. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, Dr. Forbes and I go into deep analysis mode as we examine the risks she's taken in her current role, and how she applies her experiences – both good and bad – with handling other people's money to building a biotech company.

# Risk Mitigation With MeiraGTx's Zandy Forbes, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE)
*  Welcome back to the Business of Biotech. I'm Matt Piller. And since talking with today's guest a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=0.0s)]
*  couple of weeks ago, I've been so looking forward to getting back together with her to record this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=9.16s)]
*  episode. She's a brilliant biotech risk taker. And I don't use that combination of words lightly. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  I describe her that way because her scientific, academic, and postdoc work married with well over [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=20.76s)]
*  a decade of investment banking work serve as the foundation of that brilliance which she's now [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=27.92s)]
*  leaning into when weighing risk as a biotech builder. Her name is Dr. Zandi Forbes. She's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=34.32s)]
*  the president and CEO at Mira GTX. And on today's episode, we'll get to know her and we'll learn [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=40.6s)]
*  about some of the bold fundamental decisions she's led Mira through on the company's way to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=47.2s)]
*  building a very deep pipeline of gene therapy candidates across the clinical spectrum. And [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=52.44s)]
*  doing the development and manufacturing of those candidates I might add in-house. Dr. Forbes, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=58.36s)]
*  welcome to the show. Thank you so much. And what a lovely introduction. Thank you. Oh, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=65.72s)]
*  I well I appreciate it. And I mean every word of it. You know, it strikes me when I was thinking [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=72.6s)]
*  about that conversation that we had a couple weeks ago. You know, I kind of I kind of went [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=77.2s)]
*  long on the setup like you know this is what the business of biotech is all about. This is what [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=81.68s)]
*  we're after. I think I asked you one question and your passion, enthusiasm, and intelligence just [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=85.0s)]
*  took over. I mean I was super excited. After doing those pre-briefs I know like this is gonna be a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=90.04s)]
*  great episode or not to set the bar too high for you. But yeah, no. But I've been excited about [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=96.0s)]
*  this one. By the way, Mira GTX. Do you go by Mira GTX or is it Mira Gene Therapeutics? GTX is fine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=101.48s)]
*  All right. Whatever people are willing to say is fine. Very cool. So as I mentioned, you've got, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=111.56s)]
*  you know, from the outset, right, if you look at your CV, you know, your academic record, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=119.0s)]
*  if you will, you have the makings of what looks like an academic career. You have an Oxford PhD [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=125.4s)]
*  in molecular genetics. You did postdoc fellowships at the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=131.44s)]
*  Medicine at NYU Langone. You did fellowships at Duke University and the Carnegie Institute [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=139.2s)]
*  at Johns Hopkins after your PhD. It looks like this woman is setting herself up for a career [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  in research and academia. And then in 2000, not long after that, you became a healthcare investor [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=152.48s)]
*  at the hedge fund, Civic Global Healthcare? Yes. So two questions wrapped up here. One, when you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=160.48s)]
*  were doing your PhD and doing that fellowship work, you know, your postdoc stuff, at that time, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=168.24s)]
*  in that moment, were you thinking academia research? So that's part one of the question. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  And then part two of the question is, at what point were you exposed to and did you embrace [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=180.4s)]
*  investment banking? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=186.96s)]
*  So my academic career really began as an undergraduate at Cambridge. And I, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=190.56s)]
*  at the time, I was courted as a person who had very good grades in my part ones. I was [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  courted by the newly deregulated city of London. And I used to receive sort of letters, because we [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=216.08s)]
*  didn't have emails then, dear Mr. Forbes, please, will you consider coming for an interview as a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=228.4s)]
*  salesperson? I went for one interview where I imagined myself it was for a commodities trader. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  Okay. And I knew nothing about Wall Street trading anything. So in my mind's eye, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=244.48s)]
*  I saw myself, my future as the woman from Del Monte, who travels the world and sources and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=252.32s)]
*  provides the world's commodities. Right. I got to the interview and they asked me about sales and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=263.36s)]
*  trading. I didn't know what any of these things were. And I failed. I had another interview in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=269.68s)]
*  response to the dear Mr. Forbes letters. And so when I finished at Cambridge, I got a very high [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=276.88s)]
*  grade degree. I didn't really know what to do because that seemed to be where people went or [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=285.52s)]
*  where people were courted to, right? The big city, the Goldman and those sort of places. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  And I took a year off and ended up finding a topic that was super fascinating and super unknown, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=297.36s)]
*  which is how does one cell develop into an embryo where every gene is only used in the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  right cells? What is positional information? How does life go from one cell to organisms? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  And I found someone who was at Oxford to do a PhD in this subject in fruit flies, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=322.4s)]
*  where a screen had just been done that identified every gene that was required from an egg [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=328.8s)]
*  to make a fruit fly. And so that to me was a huge, it was a universe of interesting, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=336.64s)]
*  undiscovered things. And I went and I did my PhD. And when I finished the PhD, I happened to have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=344.8s)]
*  worked on a gene that was one of these positional information molecules. And I was invited, I didn't [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=353.36s)]
*  know what exactly to do. I was invited to do visiting professorships at Hopkins and Duke. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=366.16s)]
*  So I didn't have a plan. I never had a plan. And that is a failing in my life. I feel I would have [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=374.0s)]
*  been much more successful as a particular thing had I had a plan and pursued single-mindedly [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=382.16s)]
*  that plan. And I admire people who do that and encourage people to do that. But given I didn't [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=387.6s)]
*  have a plan, I was falling into these academic roles based on what I'd just done. And interestingly, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=393.68s)]
*  I fell into the position at NYU because I gave a talk at MIT and the woman who I met with [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=402.08s)]
*  offered me a job in her lab. This woman is one of the brightest, most inspiring scientists I know. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=417.44s)]
*  She's called Ruth Layman. And she was actually the individual that did that screen, that found [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=426.8s)]
*  those genes. And she was moving to NYU where she was able to really broaden her lab, broaden what [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=434.48s)]
*  she did. And I was there because of her and because of her work. And towards the end of that tenure, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=444.16s)]
*  when I was setting up a lab in the UK, I by chance met the person Christian sued, who at that time, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=452.4s)]
*  the year 2000, was the best performing hedge fund in the world. I didn't intend to meet him. Someone [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=462.64s)]
*  I'd been at Cambridge with was an investor and his bank had money with Christian. So I met him. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=470.56s)]
*  And at the first interview, he gave me the reds for some recent IPOs, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=478.72s)]
*  Abgenix, Medarex, X-Elexis. And I was a fruit fly geneticist. And I looked at them and suddenly, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=488.64s)]
*  explosion. I suddenly saw that outside academia in biotech, people were doing everything. They were [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=497.44s)]
*  trying to discover everything, not just one gene in one fly, in one lab. And that and a number of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  things, I literally went back and met Christian, put out my hand and said, yeah, I accept your job. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=517.04s)]
*  No contract, no negotiation, nothing. I went back to Ruth and I said, I'm going to do this. And they [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=523.04s)]
*  all said, you can't do it. You're so good at this. But it wasn't that I was so good at doing research. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=528.56s)]
*  They told me that of the postdocs and visiting professors they'd had, what I was good at was [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=535.04s)]
*  teaching. So I took a year off and spent it in these hedge funds. And I never went back. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=542.16s)]
*  But I did, if I may spend one more minute. When I took the job at this fund, which was at the time [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=551.12s)]
*  a fund called Galleon, it was very secretive as long short funds are, and particularly where at [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=561.6s)]
*  that time still are. And I used to go back to my lab to sort virgin fruit flies, because you have [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=568.88s)]
*  to get them before they've mated so you know what progeny they're going to have. And I felt this [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=576.64s)]
*  claustrophobic feeling at work. It was the first actual job I'd had. And I would go back and I [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=582.16s)]
*  sort my fruit flies and I'd feel I could breathe and I could feel that my mind was flying because [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=589.2s)]
*  I could think I could daydream about anything. And I did at that time realize what an incredible [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=596.24s)]
*  luxury and what an incredible opportunity to think anything you want being an academic is. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=604.24s)]
*  So would I have kept going as an academic? Yes. Was it my plan? No. I rather abruptly [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  took an opportunity that I knew nothing about, which was incredibly hard for me when I then [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=627.12s)]
*  ended up doing it. Both emotionally like this being confined for the first time you're paid [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=634.24s)]
*  for how you're going to use your mind. But in that job, I learned more than I'd learned in [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=640.88s)]
*  10 years of academia in every day of school and university about medicine, science, people, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=649.76s)]
*  businesses, incentives, and failure. Because if you're an investor, you really, really feel [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=657.92s)]
*  the failure of everything you invest in because you are responsible for making that money. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=668.4s)]
*  And it's not money that it's about. It's about being wrong. So I'm wrong on an FDA panel. I've [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=675.52s)]
*  watched so many FDA panels. You're wrong on an FDA panel. You're wrong on an FDA decision. You're [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=682.64s)]
*  wrong on a drug development trial. You're wrong on a product. You're wrong on a law. You're wrong on [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=688.24s)]
*  a launch. You feel it and you remember it. I remember Genentex panel for Avastin in breast [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=694.08s)]
*  cancer, like a video, right? Because I was watching the faces of each person and the patient [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  advocates and how the FDA had put together that panel. And I was wrong. So it was a very [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=709.2800000000001s)]
*  incredible learning experience. And what you also learn is when you're in a position where the money [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=718.88s)]
*  is, like a really big hedge fund, everyone wants to talk to you. When you are not, no one wants [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=724.56s)]
*  to talk to you. So that contrast of how you deal with people and you deal with your own position [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=733.36s)]
*  as, it's not your position of being desired versus being not desired. It's also a real learning [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=741.04s)]
*  experience in life in general, but that's applied to how you run businesses and manage people and, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=748.24s)]
*  you know, and do deals. Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned, I mean, I think you mentioned that you're [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=756.4s)]
*  talking about the emotional aspects of that learning and making that transition. Just the, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=762.72s)]
*  let me put it this way. What else was in the very early days, what else was difficult [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=779.12s)]
*  for you to learn and grasp? And I ask that question because you're obviously an [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=784.48s)]
*  accomplished academic with a very expandable and malleable learning capacity. You know, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=788.08s)]
*  you think you could do anything. What was challenging for you to embrace and absorb? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=795.84s)]
*  And what had to change? Like, what did you have to adapt about yourself? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=807.76s)]
*  So I think that, so the first year, right? The first year, I didn't know what the word [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=810.8s)]
*  short meant. I didn't know what, I'd never seen a PNL. I went to one week after my first year [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=825.92s)]
*  at Columbia Business School, right? So it was language. I had the language of science, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=835.92s)]
*  which was very rapidly translated into the language of medicine. So I found that very intuitive. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=845.2s)]
*  The language of business and of Wall Street, right? I'd never heard the words, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=854.08s)]
*  I'd like to give you a heads up. Just for example, so how salespeople talk to you. I mean, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=863.92s)]
*  as trivial as that. And I kept thinking when they, oh yeah, I just want to give you a heads up, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=869.5999999999999s)]
*  Sandy. And I go, I kept thinking of meerkats. You know, I'd never heard these words because I lived [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=875.04s)]
*  in a different world. It was as trivial as that. It was jargon. It was all of those things. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=881.04s)]
*  I will say the claustrophobia aspect related to having [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=887.6s)]
*  sold my brain to focus on things that I didn't understand. Now, the first way I started [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=898.64s)]
*  understanding companies I wasn't taught was listening to earnings calls, right? And that [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=910.8s)]
*  taught me. And in fact, reading 10 Qs and 10 Ks, and I couldn't believe it. I mean, they're just [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=918.4s)]
*  almost incomprehensible and totally repetitive when you actually read them back to back. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  And just kind of getting a feel of a structure of how things are, as well as learning slightly [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=931.76s)]
*  what these lawyers think about when they are putting together and running companies. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=939.92s)]
*  But Christian said to me, and he was right. He said, look, Sandy, you know nothing. And in about [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=946.24s)]
*  a year, you'll start feeling you're going to be able to give opinions on stocks. In about three years, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  I will listen to everything you say. And what actually happened is in that time frame, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=963.84s)]
*  I took over actually being a portfolio manager of the small biotech fund. And when you ask me about [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=973.6s)]
*  transitions in what you learn and how you do things, that was the most transformative transition. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=982.24s)]
*  Because when you're an analyst or a stock picker, the general thesis is, as a scientist, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=993.52s)]
*  you are going to be able to have an edge by understanding the science, by looking at data [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1005.12s)]
*  and assessing the risk. And there is some vague truth to that. However, when I took over [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1013.2800000000001s)]
*  that small biotech fund, I looked at the performance of the fund the year before, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1024.8s)]
*  when the market had been up a little bit, and they were down. But when you look at why, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1032.8s)]
*  they were down only because two or three of those positions had gone to zero, because [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1038.88s)]
*  one thing had failed. Everything else was okay. So it was at that moment, I realized that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1047.36s)]
*  in this industry, if you avoid disaster, if you avoid losing money, you will definitely make money. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1056.08s)]
*  And that really informed how I was in constructing a portfolio. I also recognize that however good you [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1065.36s)]
*  are at science, or however great a physician you are, or however brilliant you think you are, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1075.9199999999998s)]
*  you will never really understand the risk of a clinical trial or an FDA outcome. You can feel, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1081.84s)]
*  guess it is more positive than negative. So in constructing a portfolio, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1091.6799999999998s)]
*  we tended to take positions where we would look at not what was definitely going to happen, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1101.76s)]
*  it was going to be positive or negative, but if it was positive for this stock, not this company, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1108.8s)]
*  for this stock, where would the stock price go? And every company has its own hindrances or [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1116.88s)]
*  supports for valuation. Where would the stock price go? If it's negative, where would the stock [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1123.6000000000001s)]
*  price go? So are you willing to take a bet and lose that percent? And that decision depends on [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1128.0800000000002s)]
*  your performance. It depends on a lot of things, but you can do things, particularly in biotech, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1138.24s)]
*  which are very constantly done in other markets of selling puts, selling calls, not naked, but [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1143.92s)]
*  paying for hedges to allow you to take bets, which you have a biased view on. So I learned [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1150.88s)]
*  how to address my own feeling of risk, because that's all it really is for human beings. We're [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1163.44s)]
*  really, really bad at assessing risk, right? And formalizing it by deciding how much I was willing [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1172.56s)]
*  to lose. And that is very like my nature. And as a portfolio manager, I'm sure every one of these [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1183.12s)]
*  incredibly successful fund managers, their personality is expressed in their portfolios, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1194.16s)]
*  like a sculptor expresses themselves in the outline of their sculpture. And that way of [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1203.0400000000002s)]
*  managing a portfolio did mean that the performance that we had was really good, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1215.44s)]
*  because we didn't lose big amounts of money. We didn't go for binary events to make 10 times the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1221.2s)]
*  money. We incrementally made money. And also, if you are intuitively curious and a bit of a Sherlock [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1227.8400000000001s)]
*  Holmes in how you think about things, interestingly, understanding who's going to buy whom and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1238.48s)]
*  strategically what's best in an industry, a lot of the big bets that we made were on takeouts, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1245.68s)]
*  and a lot of them were right, because things are obvious. Not everything that is obviously good [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1255.28s)]
*  always happens, but having a slightly more strategic view of how people and companies fit together, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1262.5600000000002s)]
*  also gained over time, was very helpful. And helpful now as well. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1271.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like I could spend the next hour asking you questions about that period [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1277.92s)]
*  of your life. But I want to get to what's helpful now. So we're going to move forward a little bit. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1283.44s)]
*  You spent 12 years, I think, in the investment? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1289.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, about a decade. Yeah, more or less. I consider academia a decade, hedge fund a decade, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1292.64s)]
*  this a decade. But there's wiggle room on both sides. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, so the current decade, when you transition to Cadman Holdings, which has since [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1302.8s)]
*  been acquired by Sanofi, you went there as SVP of commercial operations from investment banking. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  What was the story there? It sounds like you got to a point where you embraced the role, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1317.84s)]
*  were comfortable with wrong. See, this is one of the things that when I said we could talk for [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1324.1599999999999s)]
*  much longer about your time in investment banking, one of the things I wanted to ask you, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1329.76s)]
*  which you can reflect on before you get to the Cadman Holding story, is the difference between [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1334.0s)]
*  wrong as a research scientist, academician, in science, the difference between being wrong there [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1339.12s)]
*  and being wrong as people frequently are in investment banking. I want to stick with that [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1347.52s)]
*  question. Yeah. Do you want me to answer that question? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1355.92s)]
*  I do. I do. Yeah. I promise that we move on to Cadman Holding, but I need to know. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1359.52s)]
*  I will answer it super simply. You're never wrong in science, ever, because you're finding out [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1365.28s)]
*  something that's true or not. So if what you thought is wrong, it means something else is true. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. So you're not wrong in science. And I do think that sometimes in science, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1380.88s)]
*  where things do go wrong is when people think they're right. And if what they show is not [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1389.92s)]
*  supportive of what they think, they consider it wrong. But as a matter of science, science is [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1397.52s)]
*  fact-based. And if you're proved wrong, that's part of the scientific process. Whatever science [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1408.0s)]
*  is, whether it's cell biology or genetics, however, the complete antithesis is true [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1415.68s)]
*  in public markets trading. There is only one measure of being wrong or right, because you're [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1423.84s)]
*  using that market to make your clients money. And so, however right you are from a scientific [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1433.6s)]
*  perspective, if the position you've chosen to take ends up being completely wrong, you are wrong. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1443.84s)]
*  You made a mistake. Now, was it your fault? None of it matters. And that's one of the reasons, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1454.6399999999999s)]
*  from my perspective, that I found it a place of learning, because you are obviously wrong. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1462.08s)]
*  It stops up or down. You're wrong or right. And it's not you're wrong like a VC in five years. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1471.28s)]
*  You're wrong that minute, and you deal with it. I will never forget that. There were lots of things [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1479.04s)]
*  I was right about as a scientist, but I could not have been more wrong in that moment. So, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1486.8s)]
*  very different, I suppose, what is wrong, what is right, but very different measures of wrongness [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1495.12s)]
*  and rightness, where the same skills are somehow involved. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1505.2s)]
*  Yeah. How do you reconcile that? How did you rationalize being wrong when it was [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1511.6s)]
*  being wrong and investment banking was so different from being wrong in science? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1518.8s)]
*  And then I promise we'll move on. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1523.6s)]
*  Well, it's the recognition that how I rationalized it was this recognition that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1525.92s)]
*  I could know about science. I could know about a clinical trial. I could know about a mechanism. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1536.56s)]
*  And in fact, I could be the world expert. And I could also have spoken to world experts and 20 [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1542.8799999999999s)]
*  of them, because no point in speaking to one world expert, because you're definitely going [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1548.24s)]
*  to get something wrong from them. But it doesn't matter, because biology is, we know so little [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1551.28s)]
*  about it, really, that it's unpredictable. And I learned that however right you might think you are, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1561.04s)]
*  that when you're making decisions about things like clinical outcomes or, you know, an FDA decision, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1571.4399999999998s)]
*  there are so many things you don't know about that could make you wrong, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1580.8s)]
*  that rather than betting on your own rightness, which is actually what you're told to do. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1585.04s)]
*  And I think it drives some of the bad behavior in public market biotech investing. Sometimes [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1591.6s)]
*  you really don't have an edge and you don't know things before other people. So all you can do [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1600.64s)]
*  is have a very, very good understanding of what would happen if you're right, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1607.28s)]
*  what would happen if you're wrong, and choose to mitigate both of those. You will accept less on [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1615.9199999999998s)]
*  the upside or accepting less on the downside. So not going for the massive bets, but making sure [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1624.8s)]
*  that whatever you decide, you will always make money. And I think it's really, you know, when [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1635.28s)]
*  you're wrong over and over again, as one is, you learn that, you know, you may think you're a genius, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1643.52s)]
*  but you've got to think that you could easily be wrong. And that's a huge education for everything [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1652.32s)]
*  you later do. Did you carry that mentality into the move in the industry when you joined [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1659.44s)]
*  Cadman Holdings, or did you kind of put those pieces together once you were in the industry? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1665.92s)]
*  I think that the way of, first of all, with respect to different people having different [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1671.76s)]
*  personalities. I'm a person who looks out into the world. I got quite a lot of adventure in me, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1678.4s)]
*  but also quite a lot of fear. So how do those two things marry? I would say that one of the things [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1690.64s)]
*  I do to make myself calm and be adventurous is I go, what's worst case scenario? So it's checking [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1698.16s)]
*  out worst case scenario and mitigating that. And then going up allows me to build things that are [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1709.44s)]
*  risky because there are so many layers of alternative, which is really, really embedded [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1719.92s)]
*  in the company that we've built at Mira. And it's not necessarily the easiest to convey to investors [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1728.3200000000002s)]
*  or to convey to what might be an ultimate buyer, which is Pharma, because they're more used to [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1738.4s)]
*  almost like a binary stock pick, like clinical trial that's going to be a phase three, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1746.48s)]
*  that's going to be a single product. Are you going to commercialize it? Are you going to sell to [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1752.56s)]
*  Pharma? What event do you have in the next 12 months? I find that from an emotional point of [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1755.84s)]
*  view, very difficult to handle that binary risk. So I am very, it's not even controllable. It is [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1764.56s)]
*  wherever I see a potential risk, I put a layer to mitigate it in place where I can, which includes [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1776.24s)]
*  a broad pipeline of things that are de-risked. Then manufacturing that de-risk everything. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1785.36s)]
*  Optimization, not just of capses, not just of promoters, but everything. So it's a very broad [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1795.84s)]
*  view of optimization, which is the opposite side of the coin of risk mitigation. And that allowed [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1804.16s)]
*  us to have a company that's highly resilient to a failure or the markets or changes in what's the [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1812.0s)]
*  favorite product, whether it's Alzheimer's or GLP-1, and at the same time, be able to build a company [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1823.76s)]
*  that actually invents technology, like controlling biologics with pills. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1832.72s)]
*  So it's this multi-layered cushions that you can see value in all these layers, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1839.28s)]
*  and they're each supporting one another. So it very much fed through to how we built the company. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  And the company wasn't obviously just me, but who joined the company when we formed [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1853.04s)]
*  the company. And from the fund that I worked with, again, is Rich Giroux, who's our COO and CFO. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1859.68s)]
*  He was head trader for a decade with me. And so he executed my ideas in the world. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1868.72s)]
*  And I trust him more than anyone, really. I've worked with him since 2021. And he hears the [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1880.64s)]
*  words I say, and he understands them. And so this sort of fund management perspective, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1890.56s)]
*  which isn't really fund management, it's a sort of multi-strat risk approach, was not just me, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1901.36s)]
*  it's the founders of the company and how we built the company. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1908.8s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Yeah. Well, okay, so let's jump right into that. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1912.48s)]
*  Give us more color on the origin story of Mira. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1915.6799999999998s)]
*  Mira Gulley So I was actually on the board of Cadmon, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1918.72s)]
*  and they needed someone at that particular time to go in and do a number of things in the company. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1922.3999999999999s)]
*  So I agreed to do that for a year or so. And without really knowing what I was doing, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1929.76s)]
*  I went there and ran commercial and learned a little bit, but I wasn't there for two years, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1937.04s)]
*  maybe. So I got some familiarity with how you sell drugs. It was very, very complicated. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1943.2s)]
*  And I have a lot of respect for people who do that in the US in particular. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1949.9199999999998s)]
*  But they had an idea to control genes with small molecules, right? And they are not a [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1953.76s)]
*  gene therapy company. So at that particular time, we decided to take that idea, which hadn't yet [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1967.1200000000001s)]
*  been made, out of Cadmon and build a gene therapy company. And so I became one of the founders and [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1978.24s)]
*  CEO. Rich joined, and with a number of other founders, we bought together, we acquired [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1989.76s)]
*  other companies, a few other programs, and we set up a company initially in the UK, because our first [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=1997.52s)]
*  deal was with the Moorfields in UCL to buy iProducts. And we immediately looked at the [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2006.48s)]
*  world of manufacturing, because no one could manufacture it. How can we have a pipeline? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2015.04s)]
*  And we started building manufacturing. We immediately, having acquired a company from UCL, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2019.92s)]
*  which was extremely strong in vector development, we set up organoids, we focused on promoters and [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2026.4s)]
*  capsids and sequence. And from there, built this notion of really looking at every aspect of these [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2036.32s)]
*  drugs that allow you to use lower safer doses and deliver them locally in a way that you avoid a lot [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2043.76s)]
*  of the very obvious risks of doing somewhat difficult things with genetic medicines, like [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2056.0s)]
*  big gene replacement by systemic delivery. Fantastic work, got Zolgensma approved. I mean, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2063.12s)]
*  incredible life-saving drug, but definitely a very difficult thing to do, a very expensive thing to do, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2071.92s)]
*  as we've seen recently, as we've seen over the years, big, massive systemic doses. So we looked [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2081.7599999999998s)]
*  at the... We thought, okay, so what we're going to do is make genetic medicine, DNA, a drug that can [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2087.6s)]
*  be used like small molecules, like biologics, like RNA, as this new modality where those other [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2097.6s)]
*  modalities are not effective enough or not broadly usable enough. So not as it's intuitively thought [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2106.56s)]
*  of to just replace broken genes. That's what gene therapy has somewhat come to mean. But we had to [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2116.8s)]
*  build a company that investors would invest in that was able to have a pipeline of products that [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2125.6000000000004s)]
*  we really thought worked, that we were willing to spend money on working. And so we focused on [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2132.0800000000004s)]
*  local delivery of gene replacement in the eye, of changing neural circuits in the brain by tiny [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2138.8s)]
*  doses locally delivered, of changing self-function in the salivary gland for xerostomia. And so far, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2148.2400000000002s)]
*  nine years later, we've brought those products forward and we have four late-stage products, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2155.92s)]
*  one pivotal, one phase three, one about to read out phase three in the eye with Johnson & Johnson, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2162.96s)]
*  and one for a very rare disease where we just did a compassionate use. We gave the drug away [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2169.12s)]
*  to young children ages one to two. Every child born blind, treated with our drug, can now see, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2177.04s)]
*  so which is miraculous. Right. So across the board, we took a strategy that slightly avoided some of [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2186.08s)]
*  the obvious risks that other people took on board, but we didn't because our aim was to broaden the [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2196.8799999999997s)]
*  use of gene therapy. And while we were doing all that and we built the best manufacturing in the [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2204.7999999999997s)]
*  world, we're a commercial manufacturer, we have lead optimization, well, for that, we quietly, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2209.52s)]
*  like you would if you're at MIT, quietly invented a completely new way of controlling genes with [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2217.92s)]
*  small molecules of your choice that is so many logs, higher dynamic range, and usable as a drug, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2228.72s)]
*  and as a platform than we ever imagined. We're currently in a position where we can deliver [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2239.52s)]
*  anything encoded by DNA that makes RNA, whether it's GLP-1, leptin, amlin, PYY, any combination [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2247.7599999999998s)]
*  of those, every farmer's antibody, nucleases, CARs on CAR T, we can precisely control how much [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2257.52s)]
*  of whatever that drug is, is produced at any time by giving the animal a pill, and we're taking that [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2268.08s)]
*  into the clinic. So we were able to do that because we put all these other things in place, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2275.68s)]
*  manufacturing to support our pipeline, optimization to support the pipeline, but all of it, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2284.16s)]
*  which you need if you're going to use DNA to treat large diseases like obesity, you need to be able [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2290.08s)]
*  to use mini doses, like three, four logs less than you use for local delivery at another time. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2297.44s)]
*  So there was an unknown endpoint, which we have achieved more than we anticipated, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2305.6s)]
*  but we put in place many, many layers of things which are individually valuable, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2315.2000000000003s)]
*  but together each support each other's value. Yeah. In retrospect, I mean, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2321.36s)]
*  I can see where that derisks the entire initiative, but that's in retrospect. And I mean, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2327.92s)]
*  it's well stated, right? Like if you've got a broad, you know, the overused many shots on goal, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2337.84s)]
*  you know, cliche or metaphor, if you will. But leading into this, like from the outset, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2343.76s)]
*  realizing the risk is subjective, you know, the assessment of risk is subjective, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2352.16s)]
*  leading into this, it occurs to me that perhaps some people would go, oh, a startup company, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2356.88s)]
*  you know, a new company wants to embrace development and manufacturing in its entirety [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2362.6400000000003s)]
*  on its own. And it wants to build a pipeline of, I mean, what's Mira now? 14, like stated program-ish? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2370.32s)]
*  Yeah, we've got four late stage programs. We've got multiple, multiple, multiple CRI and D, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2378.2400000000002s)]
*  yeah, which we need to finance, but yes. So we can focus on our late stage. Yeah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2384.48s)]
*  Right. Yeah. But my point remains like to some people, they'd look at that and they go, well, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2390.56s)]
*  boy, I don't know, as an investor, I'm not sure that I want to jump on board with that. Like, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2396.32s)]
*  because that sounds kind of risky. They want to build manufacturing capacity. They want to [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2400.2400000000002s)]
*  own the entire thing. Some people tell me, you know, a giant step in our biotech or a giant [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2404.32s)]
*  decision in our biotech development was to de-risk by outsourcing or de-risk by [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2410.24s)]
*  being over-focused on a specific molecule or a specific indication. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2417.6s)]
*  So tell me about that. What's your head space around that actually, what looks like to some [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2423.9199999999996s)]
*  a risk being risk mitigation in the mind of Dr. Zandi Forbes? You're going to build a company [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2430.72s)]
*  that in 10 years time has transformed DNA into a modality that can be used to treat [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2440.24s)]
*  obesity, right? Fantasy. Okay. But you need today to have a pipeline that will be successful. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2448.72s)]
*  So you start with, okay, let's look at everything out there that we have to buy in license or bill, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2462.72s)]
*  and we'd like to front to you with this rule that Latin American [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2470.7999999999997s)]
* ыйivs we've got a really complicated system for delivering on. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2477.04s)]
*  The green box itself was pretty extremely complicated for me to choose from. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2485.12s)]
*  large doses that eventually came to be seen as potentially unsafe. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2490.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2499.76s)]
*  And rather to only look at where we thought there was going to be a less [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2501.0s)]
*  risky clinical path forward. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2509.52s)]
*  That involved local delivery of small doses in somewhat immune [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2512.52s)]
*  protected areas where there was human proof of concept. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2520.04s)]
*  Every one of our programs had those things. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2525.7599999999998s)]
*  So looking back, by avoiding the risks associated with large systemic [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2530.4399999999996s)]
*  deliveries and are not going after super high price drugs for really [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2542.08s)]
*  rare pediatric conditions, by not focusing on that, we actually put [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2549.4s)]
*  together a diverse pipeline based not on indication, but based on [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2556.32s)]
*  chance of success. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2561.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2563.28s)]
*  And we also looked at the market, right? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2563.88s)]
*  Because when you're doing gene replacement, it tends to be small [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2567.7200000000003s)]
*  markets that you charge a lot for. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2572.32s)]
*  We looked at our xerostomia market. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2575.12s)]
*  It's a massive market. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2578.08s)]
*  It doesn't go away. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2579.92s)]
*  It's people with head and neck cancer. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2581.4s)]
*  Parkinson's a massive market. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2583.96s)]
*  We also looked at cost of goods because small locally delivered doses are not [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2586.88s)]
*  only safer and may work well in the clinic. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2592.88s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2596.88s)]
*  They cost so much less. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2598.28s)]
*  So our Parkinson's drug, which is in phase three, just have really good [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2601.56s)]
*  data. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2606.96s)]
*  It's 1E12 titer, 35 microliters delivered. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2608.6400000000003s)]
*  It's the lowest dose, smallest dose. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2614.56s)]
*  Safe. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2617.1600000000003s)]
*  True. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2618.1600000000003s)]
*  How much does it cost? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2619.48s)]
*  In the hundreds to thousands of dollars per patient, not hundreds of thousands. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2621.52s)]
*  So there was a lot that went into choosing these indications where at the [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2627.84s)]
*  very outset, we avoided some of the risks that other people are, you know, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2634.2s)]
*  heroically taking on and addressing. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2641.92s)]
*  And the manufacturing thing, one of the people who founded the company with us, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2645.2s)]
*  Stuart Naylor, had been Oxford Biomedical and had learned how essential it was at [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2651.04s)]
*  that time to have manufacturing in-house. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2658.2799999999997s)]
*  And that decision is one of the reasons we have a pivotal program and a phase [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  three program today, because we are, we do have a lot of research that's [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2669.2799999999997s)]
*  going on in the industry. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2674.92s)]
*  We didn't, we built manufacturing. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2676.2000000000003s)]
*  We got our facility licensed. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2679.12s)]
*  We then did a deal with Johnson and Johnson. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2681.76s)]
*  We had the Johnson and Johnson, the J&J VC group come and do diligence. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2685.96s)]
*  And they actually told us at that meeting, had they set the company up, they [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2691.76s)]
*  would not have allowed us to spend the money on manufacturing. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2698.16s)]
*  J&J wouldn't do the deal with us unless we had. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2701.48s)]
*  So, right. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2705.6400000000003s)]
*  And then we, and then we built a plasmid facility under our GMP quality systems. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2709.76s)]
*  Not because, oh, we want to manufacture plasmids, which we clearly don't, but [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2716.88s)]
*  because it saves about a year in time and a ton of money. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2721.88s)]
*  Then we had to build our own QC facility in order to release material, because the [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2727.56s)]
*  big vendors were taking up to 18 months to release something that should be six [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2735.7599999999998s)]
*  weeks. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2740.92s)]
*  So you can't have a commercial supply chain with that kind of bottleneck. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2742.04s)]
*  So Little Mirror went out, built a QC facility, designed and validated every [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2746.68s)]
*  single assay for commercial QC, for stability and release. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2753.04s)]
*  We have a commercial license, right? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2760.08s)]
*  We didn't want to do that, but we couldn't be a company with the quality of [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2763.6s)]
*  vendors in the world today. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2769.16s)]
*  And we save now end to end manufacturing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2773.6s)]
*  We're very well known by the FDA. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2777.64s)]
*  We cross-reference everything. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2779.4s)]
*  FDA knows us super well from a manufacturer perspective, and it probably saves three [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2781.16s)]
*  years in the development timeline of any drug. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2788.48s)]
*  It is hugely valuable as a potential business. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2791.48s)]
*  We have partners and other companies wanting us to manufacture. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2796.28s)]
*  So there's value to our own business, but at this moment in time, because it's [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2801.28s)]
*  unique in how we built it with a pipeline, with a platform based on more [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2808.68s)]
*  than 20 viral vectors, right? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2815.48s)]
*  That's it becomes valuable as a supplier ourselves. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2818.04s)]
*  But that wasn't the intent. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2825.68s)]
*  We didn't know any of that. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2827.0s)]
*  We would have loved to use CDMOs, but it turns out to be multiple years faster, at [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2829.84s)]
*  least half the price, probably way more than half the price. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2840.52s)]
*  And aside from that, a valuable asset, we bought the land as well. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2846.08s)]
*  We didn't just lease it. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2850.4s)]
*  So we own stuff because I'm a bit of a freak. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2851.52s)]
*  I like solid things, not just like spending money. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2854.16s)]
*  Did those aspects make it easier or more difficult to fund the company as you grew [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2861.7999999999997s)]
*  and needed more money? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2871.56s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like more of a nuanced and sounds like there's some complexity, I [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2872.64s)]
*  guess, to the pitch. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2878.7999999999997s)]
*  But you're very convincing, Dr. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2880.3599999999997s)]
*  Forbes. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2882.3199999999997s)]
*  So did that desire to own the entire system, to own the very ground that the [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2883.3199999999997s)]
*  processes live on, did it make it more difficult or did it sort of enhance your [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2889.3999999999996s)]
*  fundraising periods? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2899.4799999999996s)]
*  I think that a broad view of a business as a real business, looking to the future, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2901.3599999999997s)]
*  is difficult for certain types of public market investors to think about. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2909.28s)]
*  We have some really, really smart, long investors with long views who are really [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2918.0400000000004s)]
*  supportive, and we never had a high valuation. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2928.7200000000003s)]
*  So while gene therapy companies would be going to multiple billions based on a [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2933.96s)]
*  program, we didn't do that. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2939.2000000000003s)]
*  We've actually raised significantly less money than many, many, many of our peers. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2943.28s)]
*  A, because our market cap never went to those levels, probably three, four, five [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2953.2000000000003s)]
*  times our market cap, right? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2962.16s)]
*  And we didn't therefore have that market cap opportunity to raise massive amounts [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2967.48s)]
*  of money less dilutively. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2972.7999999999997s)]
*  But we certainly have really supportive investors and investors of all different [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2975.7999999999997s)]
*  types, right? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2980.2s)]
*  I mean, there are investors who just say, well, what's your next catalyst? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2981.04s)]
*  And I only want to know about one program, but they're probably not the people who [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2985.52s)]
*  would be interested in a fundamental investment in the sort of company that we [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2990.6800000000003s)]
*  run. There are others which have very different views, which like certain [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=2995.92s)]
*  programs over others, which support whole businesses. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3000.48s)]
*  So in general, has it been more difficult than it might have been had I been in a [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3003.36s)]
*  different company? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3012.48s)]
*  Yeah, created a virtual company with super low overhead and people, you know, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3013.7200000000003s)]
*  full of people distributed across the world, outsourcing everything that you do. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3017.64s)]
*  Maybe, but it would have been different investors and we have had investors that [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3020.56s)]
*  were very happy to support the company we've built. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3025.3199999999997s)]
*  That all said, right, the last three years for genetic medicines and small biotech [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3029.04s)]
*  in general has been the most difficult ever in the history of the industry. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3038.48s)]
*  So in the context of that environment, I don't know if a single product company [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3045.2799999999997s)]
*  would have done it. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3052.64s)]
*  I mean, I think we've done an incredible job navigating the last three years and [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3053.8s)]
*  we do have supported investors and we have got non-deleted financing. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3058.96s)]
*  And frankly, in a world where capital is difficult to get, we have been in a [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3062.64s)]
*  position this year in particular to look at our business as multiple businesses [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3072.84s)]
*  and start talking to companies and investors about taking positions in [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3080.92s)]
*  different programs, taking positions in different entities, each of which is [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3088.1200000000003s)]
*  arguably as or more valuable than our current public market cap. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3094.04s)]
*  So there's a big change over the last three years as to what investors are [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3100.24s)]
*  thinking, the types of investors that are interested in companies like ours, the [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3106.3199999999997s)]
*  source of capital, not necessarily from traditional short-term, long, short, you [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3112.3199999999997s)]
*  know, not even from big mutual funds, but these other sources of capital that are [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3119.52s)]
*  looking to look for innovation, looking for diamonds in the wrath of this sort of [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3126.32s)]
*  wasteland post World War One wasteland. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3133.1200000000003s)]
*  That's NASDAQ, right? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3136.0800000000004s)]
*  There's an evolution of investors that we chain, you know, we think with and [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3139.36s)]
*  alongside as well as pharma companies in any environment. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3147.6800000000003s)]
*  And this is undoubtedly as I'm sure everyone that you speak to, this is a [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3152.64s)]
*  weird and difficult market, right? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3156.8799999999997s)]
*  Even the last two weeks. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3160.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3162.2s)]
*  Volatility is enormous. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3162.72s)]
*  The liquidity is minimal. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3164.72s)]
*  The selling is, is maximal. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3166.92s)]
*  The buying is through private offerings or ATMs. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3170.72s)]
*  It's, it's a very unusual. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3175.08s)]
*  Well, it's become usual, but from my experience a decade ago, it's not how [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3178.56s)]
*  things were and one has to adapt and, you know, speak to a lot of people, including [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3183.84s)]
*  pharma companies, right? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3190.44s)]
*  About the different aspects of value and what they want and how to monetize things [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3191.92s)]
*  that you wouldn't have if you were just a single, a single trial company. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3197.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3201.8s)]
*  How often do you, you have time for a couple more? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3202.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3204.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3205.92s)]
*  Just, just a couple more. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3206.56s)]
*  Well, I don't want to abuse our audience either. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3207.6s)]
*  So just, just a couple more. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3209.68s)]
*  How often do you find yourself leaning into your experience, especially in this, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3212.2799999999997s)]
*  this, this weird space that we're in or this weird time that we're in right now? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3217.0s)]
*  How often do you find yourself, you know, day to day, week to week in the role that [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3221.08s)]
*  you're in now, leaning, leaning back into the experiences that you, that you [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3225.08s)]
*  had as an investment banker? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3230.4s)]
*  I think there are two aspects of that experience. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3231.96s)]
*  Daily, I remember our drug development failures that I witnessed as an investor. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3236.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3249.36s)]
*  I don't think a day goes by where I don't think, Oh my God, that could go wrong. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3250.8s)]
*  Why do I know it could go wrong? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3256.76s)]
*  Because I've seen it go wrong. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3258.64s)]
*  And that is all the time. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3261.12s)]
*  And I didn't realize until I joined Biotech and worked with Pharma how [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3264.2s)]
*  valuable the breadth of failure that I've witnessed and not just witnessed [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3272.7999999999997s)]
*  that I've been stabbed in the heart by that has seared into my psyche. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3279.24s)]
*  How valuable that is. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3284.6s)]
*  So that's every day. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3285.92s)]
*  With respect to speaking to investors, I, you know, I think probably there's very [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3289.96s)]
*  few days and certainly very, almost no weeks where we don't meet with investors. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3300.7599999999998s)]
*  And I don't know what it would be like not to have been a public market investor, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3308.72s)]
*  but there is a certain decorum, language and way of speaking to public markets [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3314.36s)]
*  investors that I respect. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3323.52s)]
*  And one of the reasons we went public so quickly is I didn't have that [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3325.6s)]
*  experience with private. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3329.96s)]
*  I don't have the same experience with private investors. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3331.8s)]
*  I didn't have that experience with private. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3334.84s)]
*  I don't have the same understanding and respect for VC, right? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3337.44s)]
*  It's a different way of being. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3341.04s)]
*  And I just remember the feeling of when we were public and suddenly I was speaking [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3343.32s)]
*  to people with, I call it decorum because it's a language that you both know, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3349.28s)]
*  which whether it's really respect or not, it's a courtesy that where you both [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3357.2400000000002s)]
*  understand each other without explicitly saying stuff. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3363.96s)]
*  And I use that all the time in my communications with investors. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3369.92s)]
*  And it's certainly a relief for me to speak to public investors. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3377.88s)]
*  I don't know how much of a relief it is for them to speak to me, but I find it a [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3382.96s)]
*  much easier dialogue, which I attribute to having been one of them. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3389.0s)]
*  And having respect for them. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3393.96s)]
*  Actually, I understand that they know a lot. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3396.64s)]
*  Do you miss those days at all? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3401.28s)]
*  I don't miss it now. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3406.4s)]
*  This last couple of years, I wouldn't necessarily, you know, I think the last [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3408.28s)]
*  couple of years is equally tough for investors and for people managing [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3412.48s)]
*  companies, I sometimes think, oh my God, it was so easy. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3418.92s)]
*  It was so easy being an investor. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3424.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3426.6s)]
*  Because you've got so much opportunity. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3427.56s)]
*  If you have one company, you have to make it work. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3430.16s)]
*  You have to fight every day. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3433.76s)]
*  You have to make it work. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3437.16s)]
*  You can't get rid of the position and move on and make a success elsewhere. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3439.2400000000002s)]
*  So I, you know, yeah, when things are looking bleak and you have to really, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3443.84s)]
*  you know, force yourself to do your best. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3451.2s)]
*  Sometimes I go, oh, that was easy, but it's not easy. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3454.9199999999996s)]
*  It's not easy to be an investor. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3457.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3459.7599999999998s)]
*  So, so that's what we're going to end on, on the fight. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3461.0s)]
*  And you're going to tell me what's the next fight. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3464.68s)]
*  Like what's, what's next on your agenda? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3467.0s)]
*  What's the good fight? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3468.7999999999997s)]
*  You, you know, you alluded to the clinical progress, some of the late stage [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3469.64s)]
*  candidates, so maybe give us an update on next milestones for those and what the [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3473.0s)]
*  next big fight Zandy Forbes is going to sign up for looks like. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3477.7999999999997s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3482.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, over the last three years, my fight is to stop. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3485.2s)]
*  It is. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3492.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a fight to succeed. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3496.64s)]
*  I have really learned not to fight. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3498.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3501.72s)]
*  Really work with new investors, new sources of money, pharma companies, really, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3503.24s)]
*  really think out of the box in how you finance and move forward your company [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3513.16s)]
*  and how you do what your duty is, right. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3519.7599999999998s)]
*  To extract value from all different parts of your business. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3523.3199999999997s)]
*  And that requires a real need to think a little bit differently in many different [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3528.92s)]
*  scenarios, and that is what we're really doing now, financing value extraction, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3538.48s)]
*  new ways of doing something in a public market that's somewhat broken. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3548.0s)]
*  And in a world where there's huge amounts of capital that are interested in [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3554.6s)]
*  innovation, that's on the big thing. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3561.4s)]
*  So I actually feel right now, as we come to the end of this year, really excited [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3565.12s)]
*  about the things we're doing with respect to building the company and extracting [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3572.12s)]
*  value with respect to the clinical programs. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3579.0s)]
*  What I'm most excited about, which is actually the smallest population, is [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3583.52s)]
*  getting our drug for the blind kids approved. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3589.76s)]
*  It was something we did for charity, right. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3594.76s)]
*  Never expected to make money. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3598.0s)]
*  We gave it away and working with the UK regulators and the FDA and working with [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3599.96s)]
*  them to get this really transformative drug approved outside the normal pathway. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3610.72s)]
*  And seeing that in agencies that have been quite rigid in the past, right. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3619.12s)]
*  And being able to really, really provide something which really changes kids' [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3625.04s)]
*  lives, blind, not blind, autistic-ish behavior, normal behavior, and working [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3630.88s)]
*  with those agencies in a really collaborative, somewhat less formal way. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3639.12s)]
*  That's given me a lot of hope in speaking to both the FDA and MHRA recently, that [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3645.0s)]
*  recognition, we can do things differently here to actually get access for these [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3651.32s)]
*  kids that really need this. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3657.4s)]
*  And I find that exciting. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3659.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's super exciting. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3661.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's awesome work. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3663.6800000000003s)]
*  It's a great story. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3664.88s)]
*  I feel like I could talk to you for the rest of the afternoon, but I know you've [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3666.0s)]
*  got to get onto things and I need to get onto things. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3670.92s)]
*  So we're going to have you back if you'll come back. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3673.1600000000003s)]
*  There's so much more to unpack and discuss with you. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3675.36s)]
*  And as I said from the outset, your enthusiasm is contagious. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3678.9199999999996s)]
*  I love it. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3683.64s)]

*  It's super fun for me to talk to you. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3691.68s)]
*  It was really interesting to be forced to think about things that you don't talk [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3694.8399999999997s)]
*  about with investors or it's really interesting. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3700.6s)]
*  So I've really enjoyed it. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3704.24s)]

*  And like I said, we'll do it again. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHKTq71GUPE&t=3707.52s)]
