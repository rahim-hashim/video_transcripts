Video Description: This week's episode is one from the road, recorded in front of a live audience in Boston's Seaport neighborhood during the BIO conference (special thanks to MasterControl for making it happen). Amber Salzman, Ph.D., CEO of Epicrispr Biotechnologies (aka 'Epic Bio') explains how epigenetic editing is revolutionizing genetic medicine by controlling gene expression, without cutting DNA like traditional CRISPR technologies. Amber talks about FSHD, a progressive muscular dystrophy, how the company raised $68 million in Series B funding despite challenging market conditions, her partnership with Springbok Analytics for AI analysis of MRI images, working with a CDMO to manufacture a new treatment modality, and navigating the FDA during a time of disruption.

*  takes to lead and build a successful startup from the earliest stages. Thank you so much [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=125.92s)]
*  for being here live and in person, Amber. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=130.8s)]
*  Amber We [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=133.92s)]
*  know. Thank you for having me. Really appreciate it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  Kyle We typically start off the business of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=139.12s)]
*  biotech with a little bit of background. What initially interested you about the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  biopharmaceutical industry and maybe why you decided to join Epic Bio as CEO? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=147.84s)]
*  Amber Sure. In some ways, it's a little bit, I got lucky. I mean, as we know, you have to be [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=153.76s)]
*  lucky and flexible, but I liked science and medicine and ended up working at GSK. Well, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=158.64s)]
*  started at SmithKind in French, ended up through Mergers becoming GSK. And I was really surrounded [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=164.32s)]
*  by brilliant drug developers. And that's where I really felt privileged to be putting amazing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=170.64s)]
*  medicines out for patients. I mean, whenever we would get these letters from patients, I mean, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=179.27999999999997s)]
*  one that stood in my mind was after 9-11, because, you know, we did a lot in COPD. After 9-11, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=184.64s)]
*  we got a letter from a patient saying that if it wasn't for our drug, they wouldn't have been able [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=190.48s)]
*  to escape. So those kind of letters when you hear from families really got me going. Then, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=194.0s)]
*  unfortunately, diseases struck my family in a pretty harsh way with a rare neurodegenerative [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  disease. And having worked on all very common diseases, I will admit that I didn't fully [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=205.6s)]
*  appreciate that there was this whole other side of drug development and rare disease that was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=212.88s)]
*  different. And when I learned that my nephew was going to pass away, and then we tested the family [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=218.56s)]
*  and my son tested positive as did another nephew, I realized, oh my God, I have a few years before [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=225.28s)]
*  the bomb goes off and then we got to do something. So that really launched me into, look, I have to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=230.64s)]
*  do something. I know I can do something. There's no other option. And really pushed me into driving [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=236.24s)]
*  things on my own. And I ended up leaving GSK and starting more small biotechs and really [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=241.92s)]
*  feeling such excitement being able to do something for so many patients that are in need. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=248.48s)]
*  So what about Epic Bio? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=254.0s)]
*  Yeah. So when I talked about my family having a genetic disease, I started working in genetic [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  medicine. And this is a little more than 20 years ago. And there were a lot of limitations [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=262.32s)]
*  in what was available. I mean, not to put down what was there, but there were limitations in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=267.52s)]
*  what capabilities existed. And then when I interviewed, I remember with the scientific [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=271.76s)]
*  founder, Stanley Chia, that be CRISPR. I still, when I think about it, I'm not sure why they [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=276.88s)]
*  hired me. I was like, yeah, but you can't do this. You can't do that. And then he, on his board, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  I met him in his office at Stanford. He was explaining how the company has the ability to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=285.84s)]
*  basically get around all the limitations that I'd come across in genetic medicine. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=292.4s)]
*  And then on top of it, my husband's family has a genetic disease, fascia, scapula, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=296.88000000000005s)]
*  humeral, and musco-dystrophy, FSHD. And they were kind of on my ass saying, you did something for [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=303.68s)]
*  your family's disease because we did end up getting a product to market. Like, what about us? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  And it is actually an epigenetic disease by nature. And when I interviewed with the team at [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=313.68s)]
*  epiCRISPR, there were a few really great people that were there before I even joined. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=321.68s)]
*  They mentioned how they could address FSHD. And I was like, oh my God, now I got to do that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=326.32s)]
*  I mean, it was just, it had my name on it. And I will say the team was amazing. I mean, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  we went from nothing to having an IND cleared and a new modality in a little over three years. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=337.12s)]
*  So I definitely made the right decision in joining the team. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. I want to just let everyone know if you have a question for Amber, I'd love to get the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=347.12s)]
*  audience involved, raise your hand and I'll look up periodically and call on you. So let me know [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=351.76s)]
*  if you have a question. You've been mentioning epigenetics. I wonder if you could explain [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  the difference between epigenetic editing and CRISPR editing, which people may be more familiar [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=364.56s)]
*  with. Sure. So first, just for the easy explanation of the epigenome. So I will say I have the same [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=370.08s)]
*  DNA that I had when I was 18 and I don't look 18. I don't feel 18. And that's because of the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  epigenetics that sit above the DNA. And the reason why I give that example is that you can really [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=386.08s)]
*  control what your DNA does through the epigenome. And that's super, super powerful. The original [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  CRISPR applications that came out use this CRISPR cas molecule to bind to the location of the DNA [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=399.68s)]
*  that needed to be corrected. And then it would cut the DNA, sometimes double strands, sometimes single [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=407.12s)]
*  strand. And that was an approach to fix the DNA problems. What epigenetic editing does was we still [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=412.88s)]
*  use that cas molecule to bind to the right location in a very rapid and precise way. But in epigenetics, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=421.2s)]
*  we deactivate the nucleus of that cas molecule so we no longer cut the DNA. And that's really [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=428.64s)]
*  important. And I'll get to that in a minute. And instead, we fuse a gene regulator to the cas molecule [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=434.88s)]
*  so it tells the DNA what to do. So it could say, don't express that protein or do express the protein [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=441.76s)]
*  at a higher level. So you're controlling what the DNA does rather than cutting it. And the reason why [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  that's super important is when you cut DNA, you really risk genomic instability. So this is a safe [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=454.48s)]
*  way to control what your DNA does. And it also gives you a lot of precise modulation. So you don't [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=461.6s)]
*  have to just cut it out completely. Sometimes you just have to lower the expression, not cut it out. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  Or you want to like for an hamper and sufficient disease, you want to double what the good allele [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=473.92s)]
*  does and not more because it can be toxic. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=478.64s)]
*  I want to switch over to funding because I was in a session yesterday on cancer and funding for [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=483.2s)]
*  cancer therapies. And it was a panel of big pharma folks, BD development. And they essentially said, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=491.52s)]
*  we're not looking at it if it's not phase three or marketed product. It's a very I don't need to tell [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=500.88s)]
*  the audience of business at biotech that it's a very challenging time for funding early stage [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  companies. However, Epic Bio was able to raise $68 million in a series B last March with a novel [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  modality. And despite this incredibly hard funding environment, how did you do that, Amber? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=520.8s)]
*  Well, part of it was that while we were good, we had this wonderfully differentiated platform, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  you know, a few years ago, that was sort of been broke, had this wonderful huge platform that can [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=537.52s)]
*  do anything. What we did, and part of it is just my drive to go after patient needs. So when I [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  joined the company, I'm like great platform, what are we doing for patients? So it just worked out [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=547.0400000000001s)]
*  well that we were going to actually have indications in the pipeline. So investors really, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=551.76s)]
*  particularly last year, and more recently, they don't want to just see the hype of what a platform [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=559.04s)]
*  can do. They want to see it applied to indications. So that was one thing that really helped us that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=564.48s)]
*  we had really phenomenal preclinical data that we could talk about, and that we have other [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=570.0s)]
*  indications behind it. Also, we were super and are super capital efficient. So we there's other [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  people in our space who raised before, you know, earlier a lot of money. And it's not good that [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=583.92s)]
*  they're able to show that they have the indications moving forward. I mean, there's other things they're [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=591.12s)]
*  doing that is great. It was just they got kind of caught in the crash. But we have always from the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=595.76s)]
*  start been very capital efficient, and really focused on how do we quickly and safely get [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  transformational medicine out there. So I think that that's what really helped. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=608.64s)]
*  How do you target investors for a company? I mean, do you do you have relationships from previous [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=611.76s)]
*  companies that you reach out to first? Can you give us I guess just a sense of, you know, how you [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=618.88s)]
*  how you collect that investor base? Yeah, I mean, I always joke when I say if you make an investor [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=624.96s)]
*  money, you could be an expert, or they think you're great. So I don't depend on that, though. But I do. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=630.64s)]
*  So clearly, investors that I've worked with in the past, reach out to them, and see if what this [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=637.04s)]
*  company is doing fits their investment profile. So I will say reaching out to investors, you know, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=642.64s)]
*  there's I hate to say it's the usual suspects, and and talk to them. But I will say we're in an [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=650.48s)]
*  environment, whereas I say to the team after we are kind of exhausted from all the pitching, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  you got to kiss a lot of frogs in this environment. And that's how we did it. You just talk to people, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=661.52s)]
*  and, you know, I'll be honest, sometimes you get the feedback of like, wow, your data is amazing, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  your platform is amazing. But I don't know, it's it's not the right climate, we want to only do [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=671.76s)]
*  publics now, like, it's tough right now, we have our own portfolios to worry about. But then you do [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=678.4s)]
*  get investors who are looking at it and saying, wow, the data is amazing, where you can be as [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=685.52s)]
*  amazing, I want to get in now so that when you have the all the data come out, I'm in with the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=691.04s)]
*  winning company. And it takes I mean, I don't, I'm not being critical investors, it takes a lot of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=696.4s)]
*  guts to, you know, not just follow what everyone else is doing. And really say like, wow, I did the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=701.84s)]
*  diligence, this is amazing, I'm going to go with it. So we just as I said, kiss a lot of frogs, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=708.48s)]
*  I don't say it in a derogatory way. Look, there'll be other times we have relationships with them. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=714.4s)]
*  And a lot of them I know that as we move forward, at later stage, we'll go back. It's always a [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  good engagement. And they're excited about what we're doing. So we'll use a middle later funding [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=726.24s)]
*  round. EPI 321 is epics lead development candidate, it targets FFSHD, which you mentioned, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  I was not familiar with that disease. Prior to learning about epic bio, I wonder if you could [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=740.0s)]
*  just, I don't know, briefly tell us about the disease and the unmet need. It's really a [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=745.76s)]
*  debilitating disease. It starts, as the name says, usually, and there's variability in the face. So [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  you hear people who as they start to get worse, say, Oh, my mom told me when I was a baby, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=758.4s)]
*  I never closed my eyes, or I couldn't smile. So it starts in the face where you lose muscles there. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=763.0400000000001s)]
*  And then it works down to your upper body, your scapula. And then in many of the patients, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=768.64s)]
*  they end up not ambulating and eating wheelchairs. But it's interesting, because in some ways, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=774.48s)]
*  it can be an invisible disability. Like I was at FFSHD meeting last week, and you know, I would [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=779.76s)]
*  sit next to a few patients and just sitting at the table, you look what's wrong with them. And then [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=785.68s)]
*  you see how they have to like, drink a cup of water, they can't just lift their arm, they need [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=790.16s)]
*  help. They can't brush their hair, somebody's got to help them. I mean, I know that sounds like a [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=795.84s)]
*  big deal. But it's really tough, it changes your whole quality of life, and how you think about [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=800.64s)]
*  things. And I can say in my family in particular, one of my cousins in law, who was a really had a [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=805.6s)]
*  wonderful career in NFL films as a film director, as he lost more and more ability, you know, they [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=814.24s)]
*  let him work from home, he was in a wheelchair worked remotely, and then he just he he had to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=821.0400000000001s)]
*  stop working at a reasonably young age, a career that he loved. So it's very debilitating. I mean, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=826.24s)]
*  as a wonderful wife who does so much for him, but it's hard to like be so dependent on your family, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=832.96s)]
*  to be able to do things. So it's variable, but it is really affects your body of life. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=839.2s)]
*  I'm switching, I'm bouncing around here a little bit. I hope that's okay. I did want to ask you [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=846.64s)]
*  about EPIC's partner Springbok Analytics. This is something that just stuck out to me when I [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=851.2s)]
*  read about it because it's in it's a I think it's an AI partnership. And it's looking at, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=857.28s)]
*  I think it's analyzing muscle MRI muscle imaging, but let me let me let you explain it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=863.92s)]
*  So, as I said, I kind of gave the typical manifestation, but some patients progress [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=870.48s)]
*  faster in their legs than their upper body. And it varies. So if you're running a clinical trial, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=876.48s)]
*  imagine an endpoint that measures how quickly they do a 10 meter walk run. Well, that may be [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=883.04s)]
*  a really good endpoint for people who it affects the lower body, but you may not see anything in [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=888.64s)]
*  people that it's more rapid in their upper body. Just use that as an example. What's nice about [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=893.6s)]
*  head body imaging is what Springbok has done is they've made use of natural history data from [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=899.6s)]
*  FSCG patients, and they're able to look overall for all of your muscles. How has the fat fraction [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=908.8s)]
*  changed? How's the inflammation changed so that that way they can measure where has your muscles [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=916.0s)]
*  degenerated anywhere in your body. So it kind of addresses that variability. And what they did [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=924.0s)]
*  to come to the AI part was they said, okay, we have this overall fat fraction indexed, and looking at [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=930.0s)]
*  muscle mass, and then they correlated that data with functional measures, not just 10 meter walk [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=938.4s)]
*  run, but timed up and go a whole bunch of different measures to see how does the fat fraction relate to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=945.36s)]
*  functional outcomes. And where that's super powerful for us is that we can then have, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=952.16s)]
*  quote unquote, a digital twin for the patients on treatment. Now, it's early days, and they have to [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=958.32s)]
*  obviously spend more time refining their model. Good news is that there's more data coming in that [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=965.52s)]
*  they can do the machine learning so that they can even be more predictive. So that's where the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=971.84s)]
*  machine learning comes in to really understand overall for this kind of profile of muscle, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=978.24s)]
*  how does that relate to functional measure. And our aspiration is to be able to use that to go to [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=983.76s)]
*  regulatory agencies and say, this is how we impacted fat fraction, for example. And the agency wants [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=989.84s)]
*  to know that you made somebody a little longer feel better and address the disease in a measurable [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=997.2s)]
*  way. It's like, how does this MRI mean anything to a patient? This does that kind of tie in. Now, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1002.08s)]
*  we have other measures that we're looking at as biomarkers, but that's just one of the approaches [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1008.08s)]
*  to help us see what's going on. Have you had any initial conversations with regulators about [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1014.4s)]
*  potentially using that data? So we have not talked to them about using the MRI data. We have talked [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1020.0s)]
*  to them about using methylation data. So just to pull us back to epigenetics. So when I said you [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1028.24s)]
*  want to change the way the DNA behaves, when it comes to FSHD, there's a certain region that [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1036.32s)]
*  expresses this Dux 4 protein, which has been known to be toxic to the muscles. What we do is we go in [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1044.8000000000002s)]
*  and methylate that region, which means we tighten it up so that the Dux 4 doesn't leak out. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  What's known about this disease is that your disease severity is linked to how much methylation [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1058.5600000000002s)]
*  you have. So what we did when we spoke to the, and there's cohorts of hundreds of patients where [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1064.64s)]
*  there's tight correlation. This has been published in the last 10, 15 years. So when we spoke to the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1070.8s)]
*  regulators, we said, given all of this, and we showed them the publications, if we increase [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1075.12s)]
*  methylation, would you agree that's a good biomarker and predictive of clinical benefit? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1082.1599999999999s)]
*  And we got a reasonable answer. They said, yeah, we buy that more methylation means less disease [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1089.52s)]
*  severity and potentially no disease. But nobody has shown us that if you change methylation, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1096.8s)]
*  it changes the course of the disease. So we encourage you to use your person human study to [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1102.48s)]
*  to do that. So we did talk to, I mean, again, reasonable. So somebody has shown it yet. So [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1107.68s)]
*  that is one measure that we can use with them. We did not have the data in hand. This was where we [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1113.52s)]
*  did our pre-IND. We did not have the data in hand from Springbok. Also, like I said, there's more [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1119.52s)]
*  work that needs to be done, but we're very encouraged where it's done. What about the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1125.92s)]
*  development process for manufacturing? This is something new, epigenetic editing. I don't know [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1130.48s)]
*  what that looks like. Did you work with a CDMO? First, if you don't mind describing just the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1137.44s)]
*  manufacturing process? Yeah, we're very fortunate that we heard this woman who leads the Depaulet-Pattel, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1144.5600000000002s)]
*  who's great. And she had this mindset of even though we're early and we're trying to move [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1150.16s)]
*  quickly, we always have to design with quality by design. So what she has cautioned me, because I'm [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1155.52s)]
*  like, don't you think that's too much for just a phase one? She's like, no, because if you switch [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1163.8400000000001s)]
*  anything later on, you're going to have to end up redoing the trial. So let's build in the quality [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1168.8000000000002s)]
*  now so that when we then commercialize it, we're set up. So she really built those principles in [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1174.08s)]
*  and worked with the CDMO, had a great partnership with them so that when we went to the FDA, we [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1183.9199999999998s)]
*  could make use of their CMC process along with our approach. We put together the different assays [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1189.52s)]
*  for material release, et cetera. But it was kind of like the end goal in mind when we worked with [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1196.24s)]
*  them and we had a good partnership with the CDMO. And I think that's what led to a really good [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1201.6s)]
*  feedback from the FDA. And that was your process development person, internal person that you were [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1206.1599999999999s)]
*  mentioning. What's her name? Depaulet-Pattel, nobody ever go after that. She's amazing. No, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1211.6799999999998s)]
*  she's great. And part of it was also the partnership with the CDMO because we're small. I [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1217.52s)]
*  guess that we're capital efficient, we're 35 people. And she at the time, since then, she's [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1223.76s)]
*  hired more people in blood in the bioreactors, but she didn't have the stuff to do. But she had [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1229.36s)]
*  the idea. So she worked really well with the CDMO to make it. And the CDMO helped get you to the [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1235.36s)]
*  IND. It's interesting. My colleague led a panel on small versus large companies working with CDMOs. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1241.36s)]
*  Sometimes the small companies feel like they're shafted a little bit, not getting equal treatment. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1248.8799999999999s)]
*  You, your process? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1255.2s)]
*  Well, I will add, I've been around a long time. So I know a lot of people. So like I knew the CEO [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1258.24s)]
*  of the company, and I'm not afraid to pick up the phone and use it. I knew a lot of people there. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1264.08s)]
*  We also treated them like they were part of the team. So we would talk about the patients [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1271.2s)]
*  and really like patients are waiting. We always bring patients and talk to the team [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1278.1599999999999s)]
*  and really try to get the people on the team at the CDMO working with us. So I totally hear [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1282.8s)]
*  what you're saying that you sometimes get shafted. But I think part of it was I give a lot of credit [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1288.1599999999999s)]
*  to DiPolly because of the way she basically I learned this from her when she met with them. She [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1293.84s)]
*  goes, Yes, we want you to be a good partner. But I want to be a good partner. Like that was her [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1298.0s)]
*  little thing. She goes, How could because a lot of times they're complaining about us just as much [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1303.2s)]
*  as we're complaining about them. And that's how it works. So she's like, you tell me how I can be the [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1307.6s)]
*  best partner. I want you to cite me as the person that you want to work with. So that I think just [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1312.4s)]
*  at the stage that when you partner and, you know, respect each other and there were times where she's [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1318.0s)]
*  like, I don't think you should be doing it. Here's what I recommend. Okay, we're like this very [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1324.96s)]
*  skeptical. And then she would do small scale stuff in house and show them the data. And they were [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1329.76s)]
*  we had results like nobody else had working with them. Really good results. Are you at a stage of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1335.52s)]
*  scaling up at this point? Yeah, so yeah, so we scale I mean, you do stuff smaller, you know, we [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1342.0s)]
*  went through the, you know, if I asked all the way up to 200 litre, then 500 litre and our clinical [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1348.0s)]
*  trial, we did 1000 litre. And it turns out we didn't even have to go to 1000 litre because our [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1353.44s)]
*  titers were so good. And then so from there, we will have to look to see because she's getting [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1358.4s)]
*  issues, ideas on how to improve the scale up as to whether we'll stick with 1000 litre but our CDMO [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1365.76s)]
*  also has 5000 litre by reactors. And you'll likely stay with that that CDO CDMO? Right now, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1371.28s)]
*  everything's going well. So yeah. With the 68 million series B, what kind of runway does that [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1377.36s)]
*  give you? We don't usually just go as a runway. I mean, I will say we will have already early next [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1383.76s)]
*  year, we'll have our first clinical data because we'll have the first patient's muscle biopsies to [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1390.24s)]
*  show that our product is doing what it's supposed to. So we're excited to be able to get the data. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1394.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's very exciting. What advice would you give to other biotechs about engaging [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1401.3600000000001s)]
*  with regulators, particularly the FDA around an IND for a brand new drug model? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1408.0s)]
*  It's a great question. I will say that we because we were so small when we first started, we didn't [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  even have our internal regulatory person, we went to some consulting companies. And our team [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1420.64s)]
*  knows what our product really well. And they were like, this is what we should be doing. And the, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1428.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I'll give the bad example learn from and the consulting company was like, no, this is what [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1435.6000000000001s)]
*  the FDA does it all the time. This is how you should do it. And we're like, but it doesn't make [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1440.0s)]
*  sense. But we know in our heart of hearts, this is the right way to show that it's safe. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1445.28s)]
*  And we basically went, I say follow the data, follow the science. And if you in your heart know [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1452.56s)]
*  that that's the right way to do it. They can always say no. So engage with them, we engage with them [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1459.44s)]
*  very early on. I mean, just to give you an example. So you know, we have to go after it, it's a human [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  construct, we're going after human DNA. So when you do a safety study, that gene sequence we're [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1471.04s)]
*  going after doesn't exist. So it's not exactly a light for light test. So we were getting advice [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1479.44s)]
*  from one firm who we'd ended up working with, oh, you have to come up with a mouse construct so that [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1486.6399999999999s)]
*  you can buy into the right location, the mouse, and like, but then we're testing a drug that is [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1490.8s)]
*  not the drug we're going to use in humans. Like, it just didn't feel right. And you know, I'm not [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1495.84s)]
*  a regulatory guru. I've been around a long time, done a lot, but I just like, scientifically, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1500.9599999999998s)]
*  I'm just logically, it didn't feel right. And they were insisting insisting, I think they were even [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1506.0s)]
*  a former FDA person. I'm like, I just don't like that. So the team, we all kind of brainstormed on [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1510.1599999999999s)]
*  it. And we said, let's just talk to the FDA. Let's put a port if they tell us to use a mouse construct, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1516.3999999999999s)]
*  we'll do it. But we just don't think scientifically that makes sense. So we went with them with our [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1521.6799999999998s)]
*  proposal. So if you ask advice, I would say, do what you really believe you can defend scientifically, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1525.76s)]
*  and that if you were dosing your family member, this is what you would want done. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1533.04s)]
*  And if you feel that strongly about it, you could talk to the agency. I mean, there's smart people [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1537.12s)]
*  there. For the most part, most people you talk to the FDA, they're there because they care about [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1542.24s)]
*  patients, they want to get safe and effective medicine to patients. So they'll hear you for [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1547.68s)]
*  the most part. So I not that I mean, look, the humans like the rest of us, and some are better, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1553.84s)]
*  some are worse. That's the way it is. But for the most part, there's really good people there. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1559.04s)]
*  And I say, you know, if you follow the science, follow the data, and do what you think is right, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1563.1999999999998s)]
*  and talk about it. I mentioned we're a bio, john Crowley, who's a current executive, chief executive [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1569.36s)]
*  of bio interviewed FDA Commissioner Martin Macary today, we were chatting about it a little bit just [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1576.72s)]
*  before we started recording. But what's your kind of sense about the status of the FDA currently? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1583.6s)]
*  Or are you concerned? Are you confident? How do you feel about the current FDA? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1590.8s)]
*  I will say right now, I'm feeling rather optimistic. When I first saw some of the changes, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1594.6399999999999s)]
*  and look, we all love Peter Marks, like those kind of changes kind of got me unnerved. But then when [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1599.52s)]
*  I saw where things landed, and some of the stuff Macary is saying, I mean, he's definitely shaking [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1605.6799999999998s)]
*  stuff up. But I think in a constructive, like, we got to be creative. I mean, he said things which [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1610.96s)]
*  are like, God, that's so obvious. Why didn't they do it before? He was talking about when you submit [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1617.44s)]
*  a drug for approval, there's a lot of stuff that you have in your hands, like for a while, and then [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1621.8400000000001s)]
*  you're just waiting for the study to end and put the data in. So you were saying, like, give us the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1626.96s)]
*  CMC section and a bunch of other stuff early, because you're just sitting on that. And then [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1631.52s)]
*  you make us review it all in 30 days. And we're like, Edstown, you know, trying to, well, for [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1635.84s)]
*  for for 90, but for obviously, for for an approval, it's much longer. But those type of ideas where [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1640.48s)]
*  he's like, let's do what makes sense and try to be outside the box, the way he said we should be [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1647.1999999999998s)]
*  taking advantage of AI and things like that. So that I can't disagree with. We have engaged with [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1652.48s)]
*  the FDA since the changes, all those conversations went well. And I think the combination of having [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1660.64s)]
*  Macri come in with kind of like, what can we do differently to speed things up and do well by [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1667.6000000000001s)]
*  patients, combined with people who've been at the FDA for a long time, they understand what you got [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1673.0400000000002s)]
*  to do to keep things safe and all, I think they'll end up I mean, I think it will be a healthy, you [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1678.3200000000002s)]
*  shouldn't, you shouldn't always have group think so this will avoid group think. And I think it [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1683.92s)]
*  could ultimately put us in a better place. But there are clearly some places where I'm nervous, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1689.52s)]
*  but at least at a big picture and in the spaces where we play right now. I'm actually optimistic. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1695.04s)]
*  All right, well, before I get to my last question, I wanted to ask you here, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1704.24s)]
*  anyone from the audience want to ask Amber a question while we've got her? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1709.12s)]
*  No, it's a really, it's a really good question. So when it comes to epigenetics, it's the same [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1720.48s)]
*  type thing, you'll target a specific locus that you want to change. And we can do multiplexing. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1725.36s)]
*  And in a way, it's much safer than doing that with cutting, because then you're cutting all over the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  place. So we can, you know, if you want to up regulate one gene and down regulate another, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1735.04s)]
*  you can put that all in the same construct. I mean, it's not trivial. I mean, obviously doing [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1743.04s)]
*  100 times easier, but you can do that all at the same time. Again, you have to caution which cells [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1747.76s)]
*  do you need to make the changes in. So for example, right now for FSHD, we're targeting muscle skeletal [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1754.32s)]
*  muscle cells. If you wanted me to change everything in skeletal muscle, great. But if you wanted me to [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1759.84s)]
*  change something in skeletal muscle and in hepatocytes, because it's a disease, it gets [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1764.96s)]
*  a little bit trickier in terms of your delivery. And we'd have to think about the best way to do [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1771.04s)]
*  it. But absolutely, you can multiplex in a very safe way. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1774.88s)]
*  Um, Amber, what are your top priorities for Epic Bio for the second half of 2025? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1779.44s)]
*  Yeah, we're super excited to be in the clinic and to be able to deliver what could be a [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1786.48s)]
*  transformative medicine to FSHD patients. So we're very laser focused on getting that trial, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1791.7600000000002s)]
*  successfully moving forward. You know, we're already screening patients and we'll be [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1799.3600000000001s)]
*  dosing shortly. So really laser focused on that. We have other indications in the pipeline we need [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1805.3600000000001s)]
*  to move forward. And then I'll say it, you have to keep kissing frogs, like you always have to worry [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1813.3600000000001s)]
*  about, you know, your next dollar. So we'll be spending time making sure that we can raise more. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1819.5200000000002s)]
*  I think we have an amazing story. We've heard that from so many. So now's a good time to [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1826.16s)]
*  make sure that we can go forward constructively and help patients. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1832.0800000000002s)]
*  All right, last call. Anyone have a question for Amber before we wrap up here? One more? Sure. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1835.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1840.48s)]
*  This hasn't been a challenge right now, in particular because our lead indication is, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1851.52s)]
*  I mean, FSHD is a fairly common rare disease. So it's, you know, going to be billions in [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1857.2s)]
*  commercialization. So that hasn't been an issue. I will say that when we were reviewing the pipeline, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1863.04s)]
*  it was a consideration of how big the population was. And of course, we got to make sure the cost [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1869.12s)]
*  of goods stays pretty low so that it's not going to be millions. I will say there's more of those [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1874.4799999999998s)]
*  conversations now, but we're in a good position. I mean, in FSHD, there's been like three deals in [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1879.4399999999998s)]
*  the last, I don't know, 9-12 months, you know, Sanofi put whatever was 80 million down upfront [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1884.7199999999998s)]
*  on a real gamble. So there's been a lot going on in this indication space. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1891.6s)]
*  All right. Well, I think we're going to wrap up here. Amber, thank you so much for being here. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1899.12s)]
*  Master Control, thank you for hosting us in this beautiful space right down here in the Seaport [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUdt4xLKPWE&t=1904.9599999999998s)]
