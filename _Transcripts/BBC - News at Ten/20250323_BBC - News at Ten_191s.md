Video Description: Thousands of people have again defied a Turkish government ban on protests and taken to the streets after the leading rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was charged with corruption and jailed.
Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, is widely seen as the candidate most likely to defeat President Erdogan in a general election.  He has denied the allegations and said they are politically motivated. "I will never bow," he wrote on X before he was remanded in custody.
His detention has sparked some of Turkey's largest protests in more than a decade. Erdogan has condemned the demonstrations and accused the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) of trying to "disturb the peace and polarise our people".

*  again by the force of the state. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=78.6s)]
*  But away from the clashes, tens of thousands peacefully chanted late into the night, while [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=83.6s)]
*  Imamoglu spent his first night in prison, awaiting trial for terror and corruption charges. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=89.6s)]
*  The protesters that you see here have defied a government ban. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=97.6s)]
*  It's their fifth night out protesting, and they say that they're prepared to keep coming [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=101.6s)]
*  out onto the streets despite the police crackdown, despite the threat of arrest, because they [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=106.6s)]

*  That's why in towns and cities across the country today, millions of Turks patiently [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=118.6s)]
*  waited in long lines to cast a symbolic vote in support of Imamoglu. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=123.6s)]
*  This, they say, is what President Erdogan feared the most, an election against this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=128.6s)]
*  popular mayor. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=134.6s)]
*  The government denies that investigations are politically motivated and says its courts [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=136.6s)]
*  are independent. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=142.6s)]
*  But many Turks have lost faith in the system. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=145.6s)]
*  The police have now broken up those demonstrations that we were at earlier in Istanbul outside [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=154.6s)]
*  the municipality office. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=160.6s)]
*  They used tear gas, pepper spray, they also arrested a number of the protesters and used [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=161.6s)]
*  water cannons. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=167.6s)]
*  We also saw demonstrations broken up violently in the capital Ankara. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=168.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, the opposition say that in that symbolic vote that they held today, over 15 [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=173.6s)]
*  million Turks turned out to cast a symbolic ballot in support of the detained mayor Ekrem [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=179.6s)]
*  Imamoglu. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmqj3RA3wSM&t=186.6s)]
