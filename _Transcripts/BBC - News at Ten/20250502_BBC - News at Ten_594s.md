Video Description: Prince Harry  has told the BBC he "would love a reconciliation" with the Royal Family, in an emotional interview in which the Duke of Sussex said he was "devastated" at losing a legal challenge over his security in the UK.
Prince Harry said King Charles "won't speak to me because of this security stuff", but that he did not want to fight anymore and did "not know how much longer my father has".
The Prince was speaking after losing an appeal over the levels of security he and his family are entitled to while in the UK.
Buckingham Palace said: "All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion."
After Friday's court ruling, the prince said: "I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point…. There have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family," he added, but had now "forgiven" them.
"I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious," said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had "always been the sticking point".
The prince had wanted to overturn changes to his security that were introduced in 2020 as he stepped down as a working royal and moved to the United States. Saying that he felt "let down", he described his court defeat as a "good old fashioned establishment stitch up" and blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security.
Asked whether he had asked the King to intervene in the dispute over security, Prince Harry said: "I never asked him to intervene - I asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their jobs."
The prince said his treatment during the process of deciding his security had "uncovered my worst fears".  He said of the decision: "I'm devastated - not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay. Is it a win for them?"
He continued: "I'm sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win."
Prince Harry said the decision to remove his automatic security entitlement impacts him "every single day", and has left him in a position where he can only safely return to the UK if invited by the Royal Family - as he would get sufficient security in those circumstances.

# Prince Harry says King Charles doesn’t speak to him and he wants reconciliation | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY)
*  In an extraordinary interview tonight, Prince Harry has spoken candidly about the breakdown [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=0.0s)]
*  of his relationship with his father and other members of the royal family. He says his father [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=5.2s)]
*  doesn't speak to him, but added he would love a reconciliation. The Prince gave an exclusive [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  interview to the BBC hours after he lost his legal challenge about the level of security he [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=16.4s)]
*  receives when he's in the UK. His protection, funded by the taxpayer, was downgraded in 2020 [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=22.0s)]
*  after he stopped being a working royal. Prince Harry called today's court ruling an old-fashioned [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=29.04s)]
*  establishment stitch-up. Tonight, Buckingham Palace said all the issues had been examined [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=34.64s)]
*  meticulously by the courts. Prince Harry has been speaking to our North America correspondent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=39.76s)]
*  Neda Taufik in California. Hello Prince Harry. Shortly after hearing the court's legal judgment, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=44.72s)]
*  a devastated Prince Harry sat down for what was an emotional and candid interview. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=52.16s)]
*  I started by asking him how he was feeling. Pretty gutted about the decision. We thought [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  it was going to go our way, but it certainly has proven that there was no way to win this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=64.32s)]
*  through the courts, which someone had told me that beforehand. But yeah, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=70.4s)]
*  it's been the decision has been a surprise as well as not a surprise. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=78.16s)]
*  So yeah, for the time being, it's impossible for me to take my family back to the UK. I can't see [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=85.2s)]
*  a world in which I would be bringing my wife and children back to the UK at this point. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  And the things that they're going to miss is, well, everything. You know, I love my country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=98.64s)]
*  I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=104.0s)]
*  So, you know, I miss the UK. I miss parts of the UK. Of course I do. And I think that it's really [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=112.16s)]
*  quite sad that I won't be able to show, you know, my children, my homeland. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=118.16s)]
*  Do you want the court battle to continue? Do you want to try to see this get to the Supreme Court? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=123.76s)]
*  I don't want any battles to continue. There is way too much suffering and way too much conflict [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=129.36s)]
*  in the world. This at the heart of it is a family dispute. And it makes me really, really sad that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  we're sitting here today, five years later, where a decision that was made most likely, in fact, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=140.24s)]
*  I know to keep us under the roof. But then once you realize that that wasn't going to work, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  once they realize that, you know, myself, my wife, my kids are happier outside of the institution, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  then please just look at the facts. Look at the risks. Look at the threat. Look at the impact. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  That if anything was to happen to me, my wife, or my father's grandchildren, if anything was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=167.84s)]
*  to happen to them, look where the responsibility lies. You know? So, you know, there's a duty of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=173.36s)]
*  care that has been completely thrown out the window. And that doesn't feel great. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=182.0s)]
*  You know, whether we agree or disagree, and there's a lot that we agree on, there's a lot [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=188.72s)]
*  that we disagree on. But that aside, where is the duty of care? Because, as I said, life is precious. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=193.36s)]
*  And it is very clear that from 2020, because I was no longer allowed an official role, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=202.48s)]
*  and because I decided to remove myself eventually from the institution, that my life got devalued [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=209.28s)]
*  from the highest score to the lowest score overnight. And you reject that it has nothing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=215.84s)]
*  to do with the fact that you're no longer a working royal? Whether I have an official role or not [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=222.32s)]
*  is irrelevant to the threats, risks, and impact on the reputation of the UK if something was to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=227.28s)]
*  happen. And again, that is proven by all of the examples that exist out there. So, for me, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=233.76s)]
*  having an official role was conditional on keeping security. But for everybody else, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=241.28s)]
*  people who have chosen this life to enter into public office and then leave, get it for life, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=247.04s)]
*  regardless of whether they have risk or threat to their name. And by the way, I agree with that. I [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=253.68s)]
*  think that is absolutely the right thing to do. That if you come in and you serve your country, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=257.84s)]
*  even if it's a minimum of four years, that you get the protection that you require because of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  your public service. I was born into this position. It wasn't a choice. I've served my country for 35 [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=268.8s)]
*  years. I believe that I am still continuing to serve my country. Public service is my life. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=274.96s)]
*  That is the dedication that will never change. And then all the other bits and pieces that are [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=282.0s)]
*  added to that, there are very, very real threats that exist out there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  How are you feeling about this decision? Because clearly you have two children, Archie, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=293.68s)]
*  Lilibet. They're not able to see their grandfather, their uncle, their cousins in a way that you feel [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  is safe for them. So what's your feelings kind of moving forward? Is there any way [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  that this could be resolved? Firstly, I'm devastated. Not so much as devastated [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=314.72s)]
*  as with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision feeling as though this is okay. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=329.44000000000005s)]
*  Is it a win for them? Is it a win that I don't get the protection that the threats and risks [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=337.12s)]
*  and impact say that I should? I would hope they wouldn't consider it a win. I'm sure there's some [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=346.64s)]
*  people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, consider this a huge win. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  There have been so many disagreements, differences between me and some of my family. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=367.6s)]
*  This current situation that has been ongoing for five years with regards to human life and safety [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=378.64s)]
*  is the sticking point. It is the only thing that's left. Of course some members of my family will [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=386.24s)]
*  never forgive me for writing a book. Of course they will never forgive me for lots of things. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=393.84s)]
*  I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point in continuing to fight anymore. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  As I said, life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=415.28s)]
*  He won't speak to me because of this security stuff. It would be nice to reconcile. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=423.76s)]
*  There are things that have happened that I can now forgive. I have moved past that. I can forgive [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  my family's involvement, my father's, my brother's, and my stepmother. I can forgive [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=436.0s)]
*  the press to a large extent as well for so many things that have happened. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=442.56s)]
*  What I'm struggling to forgive and what I will probably always struggle to forgive [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=446.88s)]
*  is a decision that was made in 2020 that affects my every single day. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=452.88s)]
*  Let's talk to our royal correspondent Sarah Campbell. What response has there been to this [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=461.36s)]
*  from Buckingham Palace, Sarah? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=466.64s)]
*  Yeah, really the Palace response couldn't be clearer. Let's just read that sentence out again. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=468.8s)]
*  They say that all of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=473.20000000000005s)]
*  courts with the same conclusion reached on each occasion. And this has been a long legal process. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  You'll remember this was an appeal. Harry had already lost at the High Court. Useful to hear [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=484.0s)]
*  some of the words that were said in court today in the ruling. It was said that Prince Harry had made [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  powerful arguments about the level of threat he and his family face, but that his sense of grievance [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=494.56s)]
*  did not translate into a legal argument and hence that appeal was dismissed. So as frustrated as [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=501.2s)]
*  Harry is with the process, this is some of the country's most senior judges again finding that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=507.92s)]
*  the decisions that relate to his security were taken properly and took into account the fact [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=512.8s)]
*  that he was stepping back from royal duties and choosing to live overseas. The other factor that [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=518.16s)]
*  comes through in the interview, could the King, the head of state, as Prince Harry alludes to in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=523.28s)]
*  the interview, could he have got involved, could he have used his influence on his son's behalf? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=527.92s)]
*  Well, the counter argument to that is that it would be constitutionally very difficult [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=531.52s)]
*  while this was being considered by the government and by the courts. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=536.8s)]
*  And so more broadly, where does this go? Prince Harry says he wants reconciliation. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  We have this half hour long interview, very candid, very heartfelt, and you look, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=546.4s)]
*  it's making global headlines, headlines around the world, just as that Oprah interview did in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=550.0s)]
*  2021, just as his autobiography did in 2023. And part of that is because what it says also about [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=553.92s)]
*  the state of relations within the royal family, if anyone had any question about the relationship [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=560.56s)]
*  between him and particularly his father and whether those rifts had been healed, that interview seems [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=565.44s)]
*  to answer those questions. He says he wants reconciliation, but that his father won't speak [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=570.48s)]
*  to him. And this line stood out to me, he said that he doesn't know how long his father has left, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=576.4s)]
*  but he makes it clear that until the security situation is resolved in a way that he wants it [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=582.4s)]
*  to be resolved, he's not going to bring his wife and children back to the UK, the King's grandchildren. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZz_LUp1BNY&t=587.6s)]
