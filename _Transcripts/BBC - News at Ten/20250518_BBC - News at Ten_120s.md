Video Description: Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.
In a statement his office said that Mr Biden, whoâ€™s 82, was diagnosed on Friday after he saw a doctor last week for urinary symptoms.
The cancer is a more aggressive form of the disease, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 out of 10. This means his illness is classified as "high-grade" and that the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to a leading cancer charity.
Biden and his family are said to be reviewing treatment options. The former president's office added that the cancer is hormone-sensitive, meaning it can likely be managed.
After news broke of his diagnosis, the former president received support from both sides of the aisle.
President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he and First Lady Melania Trump "are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis.  We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family," he said, referring to former First Lady Jill Biden. "We wish Joe a fast and successful recovery."
Democratic House Representative Ro Khanna wrote on X that he is praying for Biden and his family. "He and Jill have always been fighters," he said. "I am confident they will meet this challenge with grit and grace."
The news comes nearly a year after the former president was forced to drop out of the 2024 US presidential election over concerns about his health and age. He is the oldest person to hold the office in US history.

# Joe Biden diagnosed with aggressive form of prostate cancer | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw)
*  It's been announced that the former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=0.0s)]
*  A statement from his office said that Mr Biden, who's 82, was given the diagnosis on Friday [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=6.08s)]
*  and has an aggressive form of the disease. Let's get the latest from our North America [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=12.4s)]
*  correspondent Jake Kwan. And this has only emerged in the last hour or so, Jake. So how much do we know? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=17.2s)]
*  So this is breaking news and we have very little information that was shared by the Biden [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=23.36s)]
*  former president, Joe Biden's office. And they say that on a checkup in the biopsy, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=31.68s)]
*  they have found prostate cancer, something that they see as some of a more aggressive form of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=38.24s)]
*  cancer and that it has metastasized to the bone. A few weeks ago, Mr Biden was having some urinary [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=44.24s)]
*  problems increasingly and then he has gone into the hospital to get it checked out and they have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=51.2s)]
*  found a little small nodule, a little bump in his prostate. And last week he had a biopsy and past [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=57.6s)]
*  Friday they have finally diagnosed that it was in fact a cancer cell that has metastasized to the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=65.2s)]
*  bone. This does not bode well for a prognosis. In fact, when a cancer moves to the bone, usually [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=71.84s)]
*  it means it is incurable, the treatment will be very challenging. And Mr Biden is currently 82 [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=79.36s)]
*  years old and Mr Biden's family, I'm sure they're having a discussion with him and as well as the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  doctors, try to find the treatment options. And one thing that they said in the statement [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=93.44s)]
*  is that the cancer cell seems to be responding to hormones and that gives some hope to treatment. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=98.56s)]
*  So this is all a conversation I'm sure Mr Biden and his family are having with the doctors [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=106.4s)]
*  and they will be looking at treatment options as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRjOCDFzBw&t=112.72s)]
