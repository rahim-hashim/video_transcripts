Video Description: Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on goods from countries around the world on what he called “Liberation Day”.   The US President said it was the start of a "golden age" for America. 
Trump announced that a 25% tariff on all foreign-made vehicles would begin from midnight local time.
On other imports, the EU will face 20% tariffs on goods entering the US, while UK goods will face a 10% tariff.
Trump said countries would face what he called “reciprocal tariffs” according to what he claimed they charged on US goods, with a minimum charge - what he called a baseline” - of a 10% tariff.
He said Chinese goods would face a tariff of 34% while for India the figure is 26%.
Trump said tit-for-tat tariffs would be imposed to counter not just other countries' tariffs on US goods but what he called “nonmonetary" barriers like currency manipulation and "pollution havens."

# Trump unveils sweeping global tariffs in watershed moment for world trade | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8)
*  In the last few minutes, US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping tariffs on goods [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=0.0s)]
*  imported into the United States from all countries, including the UK. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=5.4s)]
*  British-made products will face tariffs of 10% from this Saturday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=9.76s)]
*  10% is the baseline tariff applying to all countries in the world. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=14.8s)]
*  There will, though, be higher, more punitive tariffs on about 60 other countries, which [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=19.92s)]
*  Mr Trump sees as the worst offenders when it comes to trade imbalances with the United [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=24.32s)]
*  States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=30.32s)]
*  For example, 34% tariffs on goods from China. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=31.32s)]
*  Well, the president also confirmed a 25% tariff on foreign-made cars effective from midnight [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=34.84s)]
*  US time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=42.64s)]
*  He said that together, all these tariffs will raise hundreds of billions of dollars a year [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=43.64s)]
*  for the United States, making, in his words, America wealthy again. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=48.64s)]
*  Well, the president has been speaking in the Rose Garden of the White House on what he's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=53.8s)]
*  billed as America's Liberation Day, though for many around the world there are now fears [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=58.0s)]
*  of a global trade war, economic slowdown and recession. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=62.72s)]
*  Well, tonight we'll have analysis and reaction from around the UK and across the world throughout [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=66.44s)]
*  the programme. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=72.32s)]
*  We'll be hearing from our economics editor, Faisal Islam, and also from our political [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=73.32s)]
*  editor, Chris Mason, on how the UK government will react to these 10% tariffs on British [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=79.64s)]
*  goods. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=85.2s)]
*  But first, let's go to Sarah Smith at the White House and Sarah Donald Trump saying [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=86.2s)]
*  this is one of the most important days in US history. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=90.48s)]
*  Yes, he says that economic moves like this haven't been done since the Second World War [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=94.36s)]
*  and that he is declaring economic independence for the United States. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=101.36s)]
*  So as you said, there will be tariffs ranging from 10% all the way up to 50% being charged [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  on different countries to export their goods into the United States. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=110.56s)]
*  And Donald Trump explained that he has set these tariffs depending on how other countries [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=114.12s)]
*  treat US exports. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  Have a listen to what he had to say. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  In a few moments, I will sign a historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=123.12s)]
*  throughout the world. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=132.44s)]
*  That means they do it to us and we do it to them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=134.39999999999998s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=138.28s)]
*  Can't get any simpler than that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=139.28s)]
*  Now, by reciprocal, we should explain what that means because it's not just a direct [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=144.28s)]
*  tariff for tariff. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=149.2s)]
*  What's happened is that the White House have calculated all the different ways in which [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=150.56s)]
*  they see trade barriers. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=154.6s)]
*  So that could be straight tariffs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=155.92s)]
*  It could be other non-tariff barriers like, for instance, technical restrictions, maybe [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  a ban on imports of something like genetically modified corn or hormone injected beef, that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=162.44s)]
*  sort of thing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=168.0s)]
*  If you need a license to import goods from America, that also counts. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=169.0s)]
*  They talk about currency manipulation and even the theft of intellectual property. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=172.24s)]
*  So there are lots and lots of ways in which they have come up with some kind of sum that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=176.52s)]
*  they say represents the totality of the tariffs that American goods are faced when they are [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=180.8s)]
*  being exported into China or Cambodia or the EU or the UK, for instance. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=185.88s)]
*  We've come up with a number which, for instance, in Cambodia's case is 97 percent is what they [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  say the tariff on American goods going there is. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  So they're halving that and charging 49 percent with the EU. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=199.12s)]
*  They say that they had added up all of the different restrictions they see between trade [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=203.8s)]
*  between the US and the EU. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=208.08s)]
*  They brought that to 39 percent and that's why there's a 20 percent tariff going on. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  But other countries that don't fall under this heading, a blanket 10 percent tariff [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=214.28s)]
*  is being put on all other goods and that's where the UK falls. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=218.84s)]
*  OK, Sarah, for the moment, thank you very much indeed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  So as we've been hearing, the UK is facing 10 percent tariffs on the goods it exports [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=225.32s)]
*  to the US. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=230.48s)]
*  Well, earlier today, the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, indicated the UK government will not [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=231.48s)]
*  rush to retaliate against new American tariffs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=235.12s)]
*  And in the comments, the Prime Minister said Britain will take a calm, pragmatic approach [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=238.64s)]
*  and continue talks with the US about a wider trade deal. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=243.0s)]
*  Let's get the latest from our political editor, Chris Mason. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=247.0s)]
*  Chris, what do you think the British government's going to do about this? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=249.6s)]
*  Well, it was an extraordinary spectacle, wasn't it, Ben? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  There you had the president brandishing that rectangular tariff piece of cardboard in front [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=256.64s)]
*  of the world's press and cameras as if offering the odds at a horse race. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=262.44s)]
*  And the striking thing is that people in government here were absorbing that live on the television [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=268.2s)]
*  just as people were around the world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=273.76s)]
*  There is a sombre tone from people I speak to in government here tonight because their [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=276.68s)]
*  view is that any tariff is something they would rather not have. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  But they are relieved that the 10 percent tariff is at the lower end of expectations, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  both in terms of international comparison and, crucially, compared with how high they [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=289.4s)]
*  feared it might be. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=294.56s)]
*  And actually, in just the last 30 seconds or so, we have had a statement from the business [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  secretary, Jonathan Reynolds. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=300.96s)]
*  It runs to several paragraphs. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=302.96s)]
*  I'll bring you the thrust of it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=303.96s)]
*  It is the first time I'm seeing it as I read it to you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=305.88s)]
*  He says that we'll always act in the best interests of UK businesses and consumers. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=309.32s)]
*  He points out that in the last few weeks there has been negotiations ongoing about a limited [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  trade deal between the US and the UK with the hope that that might bring these tariffs [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  down or, indeed, eradicate them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  He says we have a range of tools at our disposal. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  We will not hesitate to act. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=327.4s)]
*  We will continue to engage with UK businesses, including on their assessment of the impact [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=329.84s)]
*  of further steps. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  Nobody wants a trade war, he says. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=335.88s)]
*  Our intention remains to secure a deal, but nothing is off the table. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=338.0s)]
*  The government will do everything necessary to defend the UK national interest. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=342.36s)]
*  So they're attempting to maintain, Ben, a sober and, as they would see it, a proportionate [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=346.24s)]
*  response to what we're seeing from Washington and a desire to keep negotiating this hoped [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=350.72s)]
*  for trade deal, but holding on to the potential to ratchet things up, were that to prove necessary. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=356.24s)]
*  OK, Chris, thank you very much indeed. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=363.56s)]
*  And we can also talk to our economics editor, Faisal Islam, who's with me in the studio. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=365.68s)]
*  Faisal, these tariffs are clearly going to have a huge impact on the British economy, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=369.32s)]
*  also the global economy. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=373.36s)]
*  What's your assessment of where we are tonight? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=374.88s)]
*  When you step back, I think you have to give the context to this, which is an extraordinary [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  move, actually. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=381.56s)]
*  Even if we may have expected larger numbers in some regards, hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=382.72s)]
*  per year is what they say it should raise. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  The figure that Donald Trump used, they confirmed the 25% car tariffs coming into force tonight, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=391.24s)]
*  no exclusions for the UK. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=400.08s)]
*  At base, although we heard a lot about reciprocal tariffs, so, you know, tip for tack, quid pro [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=402.96s)]
*  quo, based on what is done to America right now, at base there's a 10% universal tariff [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  for everybody. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=414.36s)]
*  So it may be a relief that the UK is at that lower ebb, but that still means six billion [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=415.48s)]
*  on that, maybe if you include the cars, seven billion of extra costs. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=420.35999999999996s)]
*  But the point of this, we hear, is to divert trade flows. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=425.64s)]
*  I think we can see the document that was held up by President Trump there, and you see a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  whole sort of list, and in the blue there you see what America thinks is being done [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  to it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=441.84s)]
*  And it isn't just the tariff, as Sarah was saying, it's currency manipulation and other [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=442.84s)]
*  trade barriers. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=446.28s)]
*  And President Trump says he's being kind by only sort of replying with half of that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=447.76s)]
*  But there are some huge numbers there, including some rather poor countries, some crisis countries [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=452.64s)]
*  like Myanmar and Laos and Bangladesh there on 37%, China on 34%, well, that's huge. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=456.84s)]
*  European Union on 20% when the UK is on 10%, well, that's a net benefit, you might argue, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  for the UK, but also it could create some distortions to trade. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  The bottom line is this, the model of trade in the world will shift hugely, that is the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=472.44s)]
*  point of this change, but it could cause, you know, Taiwan, a key ally of the US, also [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  tariffs hugely. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjp8LwSSAY8&t=485.59999999999997s)]
