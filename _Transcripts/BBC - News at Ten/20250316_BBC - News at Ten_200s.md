Video Description: Police have detained 10 people after a fire at a nightclub in North Macedonia killed at least 59 people.
Video inside the club reveals sparks from flares hit the ceiling above the stage where a band was performing, setting fire to highly flammable material. 
The blaze broke out around 02:30 in the morning at the Pulse club in Kocani, where about 500 people were watching a concert by DNK, a popular hip-hop duo in Macedonia.
Only one member of the band survived and was being treated in hospital.  At least 155 people were injured in the disaster.
Macedonia’s Interior Minister Pance Toskovski said the venue did not have a legal licence to operate, while police are looking into why the club was allowed to operate and whether bribes had been paid.
The venue has been described as an "improvised nightclub" in the local press, having previously been a carpet warehouse.  It’s reported that there was only one effective exit from the building and that a back door had been locked and could not be used to escape.   The authorities have said there appeared to be breaches in fire safety regulations.

*  This was the moment when a great night out turned into a disaster. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=37.64s)]
*  North Macedonia's interior ministry says sparks from onstage pyrotechnics hit a ceiling which [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=41.48s)]
*  was made of highly flammable material at the Pulse nightclub in Kocheny. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=46.68s)]

*  band DNK. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=56.0s)]
*  The flames soon took hold. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=58.12s)]

*  Maria lost her sister in the panic. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=63.56s)]
*  The fire broke out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=67.88s)]
*  Everyone started screaming and shouting, get out, get out. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=69.36s)]
*  But unfortunately there was only one exit. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=72.48s)]
*  Then everyone started pushing each other. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=74.84s)]
*  So I headed for the exit. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=76.74s)]
*  I don't know how, but I ended up on the ground. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=78.16s)]
*  I couldn't get up. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=80.68s)]
*  And at that moment people started stomping on me. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=81.68s)]
*  I don't know how. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=84.4s)]
*  But somehow I managed to get out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=85.68s)]
*  Police are now blocking off the way into the Pulse nightclub which is behind this yellow [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=89.12s)]
*  and green hotel that you can see. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=94.28s)]
*  Because this is now the site of a criminal investigation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=96.68s)]
*  Quite apart from the fact that the venue went on fire and burned so fiercely, the police [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=100.72s)]
*  and the authorities want to know why it was so many people were packed inside and so many [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=105.56s)]
*  of them appear to have been underage. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=110.56s)]
*  The authorities say those who died were aged from 14 to 24. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=114.08s)]
*  Outside the local hospital, devastated parents spoke of their loss and their anger. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=119.12s)]
*  Why is the mayor not here? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=126.16s)]
*  Why didn't the mayor send an inspection to check up on this club? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  I only had one child, one, only one, and they took it away from me. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=132.36s)]
*  And tonight people gathered at a vigil on Cocheny's riverside to remember their friends [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=138.96s)]
*  and family members. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=143.62s)]
*  90% of the people are my friends. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=145.02s)]
*  One year, two years older or younger than me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  This is a very sad time for this town. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=153.18s)]
*  Ministers are promising an urgent investigation saying everyone who failed must be held to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=158.58s)]
*  account. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=163.62s)]
*  They'll need to move quickly and decisively to help a country in anguish from the sudden [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=164.62s)]
*  and needless loss of so many young people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=169.58s)]
*  And there are still dozens of people being treated here at Cocheny Hospital. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=174.62s)]
*  The scale of the disaster really has been staggering for a town of this size. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=179.26s)]
*  Fewer than 25,000 people live here and there were more than 250 deaths and injuries. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Db8ih7c61Y&t=185.14000000000001s)]
