Video Description: A third night of violence broke out in Northern Ireland as a leisure centre in the town of Larne providing emergency shelter for families who had fled the violence came under attack. 
It follows rioting in Ballymena by masked men who attacked police and set homes and cars on fire.  Police condemned their actions as “racist thuggery” targeting ethnic minorities and police officers and said they were investigating “racially-motivated hate crimes”.  32 officers were injured in the violence. 
The disorder began following a protest over an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena.  
Mid and East Antrim Borough Council confirmed the leisure centre attacked in Larne had provided emergency shelter for families in urgent need following disturbances in Ballymena.
