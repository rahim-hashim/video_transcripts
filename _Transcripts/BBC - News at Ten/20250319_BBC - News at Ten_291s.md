Video Description: Russia and Ukraine  launched air attacks that damaged each other's infrastructure, just hours after Vladimir Putin said Russia would stop targeting Ukrainian energy sites.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's targets included hospitals. He said the Russian leader had in effect rejected a comprehensive ceasefire in his phone talks with US President Donald Trump.
Putin told Trump a full ceasefire would only work if Ukraine's allies stopped giving military assistance - a condition Ukraine's European allies have previously rejected.
Officials in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said that a Ukrainian drone attack sparked a small fire at an oil depot.  Within hours of Putin agreeing to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, Zelensky said there had been "hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure", including a hospital in Sumy.
The region's government posted footage of the destruction, in which smoke can be seen rising from the caved-in hospital wing. Officials have since said that there had been no casualties.
Russian state media has reported the Trump-Putin phone call as a victory for their country, with President Putin rejecting calls for a 30-day ceasefire and restating previous conditions.

# Ukraine accuses Putin of breaking promise to Trump with airstrikes on infrastructure | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI)
*  President Zelensky said Vladimir Putin had already gone back on his promise made to Donald Trump not to attack Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Kremlin claims Ukraine targeted an oil facility in what it called a deliberate provocation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=8.88s)]
*  James Landale has the very latest from Kiev. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=14.4s)]
*  This is not what a ceasefire looks like. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=20.48s)]
*  These are Russian drones striking a hospital in Sumy in the east of Ukraine, according to the emergency services. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=23.119999999999997s)]
*  Further south, Ukraine State Railway said Russia had launched an attack on its power network. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=30.96s)]
*  And over the border in Russia, an oil depot, the authorities said, had been hit by Ukraine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=37.44s)]
*  As patients were helped out of damaged hospitals, Ukraine accused Vladimir Putin of breaking his promise to pause attacks on energy facilities. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=43.84s)]
*  On a visit to Finland, President Zelensky said the strikes showed Ukraine needed more, not less, Western support. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=52.4s)]
*  We hope that America will continue to work and pressure Russia. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=60.8s)]
*  We consider the unconditional full ceasefire as one of the initial steps towards peace. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=64.8s)]
*  But security guarantees for Ukraine are definitely needed. Otherwise, Putin will come with war again. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=71.12s)]
*  Finland's president said Ukraine had an undeniable right to defend itself with help from allies, something Russia had no right to restrict. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=78.32s)]
*  Ukraine accepted a ceasefire without any forms of conditions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=86.88s)]
*  If Russia refuses to agree, we need to increase our efforts to strengthen Ukraine and ratchet up pressure on Russia to convince them to come to the negotiating table. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=94.08s)]
*  This arch was built in Soviet times to celebrate the supposed friendship between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=106.76s)]
*  Well, no more. But people here are growing increasingly worried that while Ukraine is offering concessions to get a ceasefire, their former ally is demanding ever more and giving even less. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=112.48s)]
*  But amid the gloom, some light. These just some of the 175 Ukrainian servicemen released from Russian jails. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=125.28s)]
*  A similar number of Russians freed by Ukraine. A routine exchange, but for those involved, a moment of joy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=134.0s)]
*  James Landell, BBC News, Kiev. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=140.0s)]
*  Well, what's the view from the Kremlin on the latest push to get a ceasefire? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=144.0s)]
*  And is there any evidence President Putin might be willing to compromise on his long list of demands from Moscow? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=148.0s)]
*  Here's Steve Rosenberg. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=154.0s)]
*  In Moscow, some things are changing. Winter here, slowly giving way to spring. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=156.72s)]
*  But no change in the political weather. No compromise in the air. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=164.72s)]
*  Listen to the language President Putin used today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=169.72s)]
*  The Russian army, he said, was completely routing Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=176.44s)]
*  No mention of Tuesday's telephone call with Donald Trump. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=183.44s)]
*  But the Russian papers were full of it. Vladimir Putin believes that Russia is winning the war against Ukraine and is in no rush to declare a comprehensive ceasefire. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=188.44s)]
*  Moscow seeks maximum pressure on Kiev. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=199.44s)]
*  We could talk about a complete Russian victory if Ukraine becomes a real buffer zone, demilitarized buffer zone, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=204.16s)]
*  with very limited armed forces, with very limited practical cooperation with NATO, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=212.16s)]
*  without joint military exercises, without military supplies from NATO. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=218.16s)]
*  If it's Ukraine's surrender Moscow wants, would Donald Trump stand in its way? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=224.16s)]
*  The Kremlin today said that Presidents Putin and Trump trust each other and understand each other very well. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=230.88s)]
*  The other thing that Donald Trump understands, because the Kremlin has dropped plenty of hints, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=237.88s)]
*  is that there are lots of lucrative deals to be done in Russia. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=242.88s)]
*  It's why Ukrainians fear that President Trump will prioritize that over helping Kiev get a fair deal to end the war. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=246.88s)]
*  The Kremlin praises Donald Trump, but on the streets of Moscow they're skeptical. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=255.6s)]
*  He changes his mind a lot, says Tatyana. One minute Trump gives, the next he takes away. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=263.6s)]
*  Vladimir is still waiting for proof that Trump will mend relations with Russia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=270.6s)]
*  We've been promised things before, he says. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=275.6s)]
*  Donald Trump has promised huge change in America and abroad. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=279.32000000000005s)]
*  Russia hopes it will benefit. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHYdrSdtmJI&t=288.32000000000005s)]
