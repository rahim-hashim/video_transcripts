Video Description: More than 70 countries  have signed a statement criticising President Trump's decision to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court - the world’s highest criminal court, under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. 
They said the measures increased the risk of dictators and those accused of the most serious wrongdoing, including war crimes, ethnic cleansing and genocide,  escaping punishment. 
Donald Trump had condemned the ICC for issuing arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister who are wanted for alleged war crimes in Gaza.   
The ICC has also issued warrants against senior Hamas leaders implicated in the attack on Israel on October 7th 2023.

# Global condemnation as Trump sanctions International Criminal Court | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4)
*  Britain, Germany and France are among more than 70 countries which have signed a statement criticizing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump's decision to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court, the ICC. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=5.92s)]
*  It said the measures increase the risk of exemptions from punishment for the most serious crimes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=11.6s)]
*  Donald Trump had criticized the ICC for issuing arrest warrants for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=17.36s)]
*  Netanyahu and his former defense minister who are wanted for alleged war crimes in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Let's discuss with our security correspondent Frank Gardner. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=28.96s)]
*  So what are we to make of all of this in relation to the ICC, Frank? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Let's just remind ourselves what is the ICC. It's the highest court on the planet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=37.36s)]
*  It is the mechanism by which the international community holds people to account for the most [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=42.16s)]
*  serious crimes, alleged war crimes, abuses against humanity. It's a kind of latter-day [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Nuremberg as it were. It was set up in 1998 by the Statute of Rome. Now in this particular case, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=54.72s)]
*  the reason why President Trump has introduced sanctions against it is because back in November, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=60.48s)]
*  just three months ago, it indicted Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister and his [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=66.24s)]
*  former defense minister, Yuv Golanat, for alleged war crimes, particularly for what they had done [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=72.08s)]
*  in Gaza or specifically for Israel's actions in Gaza. An indictment that was vigorously rejected [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=76.8s)]
*  by Israel and those two individuals. But this goes far further than just Israel. If you remember, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=84.0s)]
*  back in March 2023, most of the free world, the democratic world rejoiced when the ICC, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=89.52s)]
*  the International Criminal Court, indicted President Putin and his minister for children's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=95.76s)]
*  rights, Maria Lvová-Bolova. And it was very unlikely that they were ever going to see [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=103.36s)]
*  stand trial in The Hague. But nevertheless, it sent an important message. Now this particular [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=109.36s)]
*  move of President Trump's drives a coach and horses through the West's attempts or much of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=115.36s)]
*  the world's attempts, not just the West, to hold autocrats, dictators and abusers to account. And [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=121.2s)]
*  that is, I think, quite a dangerous precedent. It will be, I think, celebrated in some parts of the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=128.72s)]
*  world where they want to see the dismantling of the international rules-based order. So quite a [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=133.6s)]
*  dangerous move, I think. Frank, thanks so much. Frank Gardner. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quOdLN6CNq4&t=138.96s)]
