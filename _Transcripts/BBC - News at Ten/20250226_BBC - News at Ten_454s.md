Video Description: President Trump has confirmed that there will be no significant US security guarantee for Ukraine, despite agreement on a deal to exploit the country's minerals.  Speaking at his first full cabinet meeting since re-taking the White House, Mr Trump said Europe, not the US must underwrite Ukraine’s future security. 
Mr Trump also confirmed the US was signing a “very big agreement” with Ukraine for access to its mineral resources.   He said it would to amount to around $300 billion.  
President Zelensky, who is due to fly to Washington on Friday, said that without security guarantees there would be no justice and no real ceasefire in Ukraine.

# President Trump confirms no US security guarantee for Ukraine | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4)
*  Donald Trump says it's a very big deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=0.0s)]
*  His agreement with Kiev for American access to Ukraine's mineral resources [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=2.4s)]
*  worth hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=7.0s)]
*  But what do the Ukrainians get in return? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=9.4s)]
*  That seems unclear tonight, with President Zelensky saying [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  the agreement doesn't include security guarantees, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=15.0s)]
*  that America will help stop Russia breaking any future ceasefire deal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=18.6s)]
*  In fact, Mr Trump, at his first cabinet meeting since retaking the White House, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=23.2s)]
*  said it was Europe, not the United States, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=27.8s)]
*  that should be responsible for Ukraine's security. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=30.2s)]
*  President Zelensky is due to fly to Washington on Friday. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=33.4s)]
*  We'll be live in Kiev, but first, Sarah Smith in Washington [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=37.2s)]
*  as our top story. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=40.8s)]
*  President Trump kicked off his first cabinet meeting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=44.2s)]
*  by announcing an imminent deal with Ukraine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=46.6s)]
*  It's not a peace deal, but a financial deal to benefit America. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  President Zelensky is going to be coming on Friday. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=54.6s)]
*  That's now confirmed, and we're going to be signing an agreement, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=57.4s)]
*  which will be a very big agreement. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=60.8s)]
*  The previous administration put us in a very bad position, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=62.6s)]
*  but we've been able to make a deal where we're going to get our money back [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=65.6s)]
*  and we're going to get a lot of money in the future. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=68.8s)]
*  More than $350 billion for America, he says, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=71.2s)]
*  without making any promises to protect Ukrainian territory. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=75.6s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond very much. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=79.0s)]
*  We're going to have Europe do that, because it's in... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=83.0s)]
*  We're talking about Europe as their next-door neighbour. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=85.4s)]
*  I know that UK has said and France has said that they want to put, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=88.2s)]
*  they volunteered to put so-called peacekeepers on the site, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=93.0s)]
*  and I think that's a good thing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine is rich in rare earth minerals, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=99.4s)]
*  and President Trump wants a large stake in the future exploitation [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=102.2s)]
*  of these resources to repay the military support [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  the US has already given to Ukraine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  President Zelensky wants guarantees for the future security of his country. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=111.8s)]
*  Without future security guarantees, we will not have really just peace [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=116.2s)]
*  and we will not have really ceasefire, what Trump has spoken about, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=123.0s)]
*  and if we don't have it, nothing will work. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=127.2s)]
*  Donald Trump has dealt with Vladimir Putin many times before [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=131.0s)]
*  and recently spoke to him on the phone about Ukraine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=135.0s)]
*  Today he described Mr Putin as a smart and a cunning man [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=138.4s)]
*  who he believes will agree a deal over Ukraine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=141.8s)]
*  Will he have to make concessions to President Putin? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=144.4s)]
*  Yeah, he will. He will. He's going to have to. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think, I believe that because we got elected, that war will come to an end. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=149.8s)]
*  And I also believe if we didn't get elected, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=157.8s)]
*  if this administration didn't win the election by a lot, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=160.0s)]
*  that that war would go on for a long time and he would want to take the whole thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=165.4s)]
*  Russia will not get to keep all the territory it has seized by force, suggested Mr Trump. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  We're going to do the best we can to make the best deal we can for both sides, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=178.0s)]
*  but for Ukraine we're going to try very hard to make a good deal [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=181.6s)]
*  so that they can get as much back as possible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  President Trump's ambitions for making peace also extend to the Middle East. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=189.4s)]
*  He posted this bizarre AI-generated video on social media. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=194.8s)]
*  It appears to show an imagined, rebuilt post-war Gaza [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=198.8s)]
*  complete with golden Trump statues and beachfront properties. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=202.8s)]
*  According to the White House, the President did not create this video, nor did anyone on their team. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=205.8s)]
*  But he did pin it to the top of his feed. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=211.8s)]
*  In the real world, the road to Ukrainian peace currently runs through the White House. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=214.8s)]
*  After the French president's visit earlier this week, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=218.8s)]
*  Kier Starmer will be here tomorrow before President Zelensky arrives on Friday. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=221.8s)]
*  With Ukraine's future and America's relationship with Europe all up for discussion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=225.8s)]
*  Sarah Smith, BBC News, Washington. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=230.8s)]
*  We're going to have more from Sarah in a moment, but first James Waterhouse is live in Kiev. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=233.8s)]
*  James, some are wondering, without US security guarantees, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=238.8s)]
*  what exactly is Ukraine getting out of this deal on minerals? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=242.8s)]
*  Clive, it doesn't feel like the start of a meaningful peace process to end a raging war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=247.8s)]
*  It feels like a cross between a business venture and some kind of trade deal. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=254.8s)]
*  We heard from government sources yesterday that an agreement had been reached on the mineral deal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=260.8s)]
*  And so we assembled at the Presidential Palace today to find out what the details of that deal were. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=265.8s)]
*  And we simply heard a President Zelensky there say he hoped it would lead to knock-on agreements [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=271.8s)]
*  that could potentially lead to security guarantees. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=277.8s)]
*  It sounds complicated, but everything is linked. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=280.8s)]
*  Without a mineral deal, a mineral deal will rely on a ceasefire, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=283.8s)]
*  and a ceasefire will rely on security guarantees from America. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=287.8s)]
*  That is why President Zelensky is continuing to engage with the White House in this way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=291.8s)]
*  But on this visit, you wonder what is going to be achieved on the Ukrainian side. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=297.8s)]
*  Is he going to sign a piece of paper, or is this about meeting Donald Trump before he meets Vladimir Putin? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=301.8s)]
*  He said he's going to be direct. He said he's going to ask him straight, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=308.8s)]
*  are you going to keep supporting Ukraine or not? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=310.8s)]
*  And there's also the other chance that if Donald Trump tries to impose a ceasefire deal [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=314.8s)]
*  that is unacceptable in the eyes of President Zelensky, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=319.8s)]
*  that doesn't meet the interests of his country, then he won't sign it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=322.8s)]
*  And that would have implications for how this war is fought, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=326.8s)]
*  the future of Ukraine, and what Europe does alongside it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=329.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Sarah, on the face of it, this seems to be a win-win for Donald Trump. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=333.8s)]
*  Access to Ukraine's minerals worth billions of billions of dollars, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=339.8s)]
*  but no security guarantee for Ukraine. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=343.8s)]
*  Yeah, Donald Trump likes to think of himself as a peacemaker, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=347.8s)]
*  but he is really a deal-maker first and foremost. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=350.8s)]
*  And if he's right about what's in this minerals deal, it's the deal of the century. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=352.8s)]
*  I mean, America would be recouping four times, maybe more, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=357.8s)]
*  the value of the assistance that they've given to Ukraine in military support, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=360.8s)]
*  as well as securing future access to these critical resources [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=364.8s)]
*  which are required for technological development. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=367.8s)]
*  Now, hopefully on Friday we'll see a bit more detail of the deal, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=370.8s)]
*  and we'll be able to see whether it really is as good as it sounds for Donald Trump and for America. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=372.8s)]
*  Yeah, and Sikhiastamma, he'll be at the White House tomorrow, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=377.8s)]
*  seemingly in agreement with Donald Trump that it's Europe [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=380.8s)]
*  that must shoulder more of the security burden for Ukraine. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=383.8s)]
*  Yeah, he's going to tell Donald Trump that he agrees that Europe needs to step up [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=388.8s)]
*  on the global security stage and take on more responsibility, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=392.8s)]
*  and of course he'll be able to tell him that he's committed to spending more [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=395.8s)]
*  on the British military to take part in that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=398.8s)]
*  Harder message to deliver is to say that the UK doesn't believe that there can be [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=401.8s)]
*  any negotiations about the future of Ukraine without Ukraine being involved, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=405.8s)]
*  and he has to somehow deliver that message without in any way being seen to disagree [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=410.8s)]
*  with or contradict Donald Trump, certainly not in public. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=414.8s)]
*  There's other things to talk about as well, the future of the Middle East [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=418.8s)]
*  and any peace settlement there, and crucially trade, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=421.8s)]
*  and the threat that tariffs or import taxes could be deployed on British exports [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=424.8s)]
*  coming into America. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=430.8s)]
*  Well, there's a lot to talk about and a delicate diplomatic dance to be done [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=432.8s)]
*  where Sir Kier Stammer needs to find a way to tell President Trump [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=436.8s)]
*  some things that he doesn't want to hear whilst not appearing to disagree with him [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=439.8s)]
*  and certainly without losing him on his side. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=443.8s)]
*  Indeed. Alright, Sarah Smith, our North America editor, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=446.8s)]
*  and James Wathaus, our Ukraine correspondent, many thanks. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBsMw4T4T4&t=449.8s)]
