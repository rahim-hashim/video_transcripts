Video Description: Pakistan’s  Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif has said India will “pay the price” for carrying out airstrikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashir.
Pakistan’s National Security Committee authorised a military response, stating that India had "ignited an inferno in the region.”
India said it attacked nine targets in the airstrikes, which it said were in retaliation for a militant attack on Indian tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, in which at least 26 people were killed.
Pakistan said 31 people had been killed in the Indian airstrikes, while India said Pakistani shelling in response to the strikes had killed at least 15 civilians.

# Pakistan accuses India of “lighting an inferno” fuelling fears of wider conflict | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU)
*  Pakistan's Prime Minister has accused India of igniting an inferno with the missiles it launched at his country overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=0.0s)]
*  Shehbaz Sharif said India had made a grave mistake for which it will now have to pay the price. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=7.68s)]
*  At least 31 people were killed in the overnight attacks. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  India says it was targeting what it calls terrorist infrastructure in nine different locations. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=16.72s)]
*  The Indian strikes were followed by heavy Pakistani shelling across the line of control, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=22.72s)]
*  which India says killed between 10 and 15 people. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=28.32s)]
*  The smouldering remains of a home. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=33.52s)]
*  Shell casings from last night's gunfire mixed with broken bits of people's lives. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=37.36s)]
*  Villages like Salamabad along the line of control in Indian-administered Kashmir [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=44.72s)]
*  pounded overnight into the morning as India and Pakistan exchanged artillery fire. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=50.72s)]
*  Reporting dozens of casualties on both sides. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=58.16s)]
*  Many of the injured residents from Salamabad were brought to this nearby hospital. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  One of the burned down homes we saw earlier belonged to Badr Din Naik and his family. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=69.12s)]
*  Me and my children had barely enough time to run after two Pakistani shells landed in the middle [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  of our home. You've seen our loss. We have nothing left. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=84.56s)]
*  India under pressure domestically to respond to last month's attack [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=93.2s)]
*  when gunmen opened fire on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=97.2s)]
*  26 people died. The deadliest attack on civilians in recent years. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=101.36s)]
*  India blaming militants operating in Pakistan, an allegation Pakistan denies. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=107.36s)]
*  India exercised its right to respond and preempt as well as deter more such cross-border attacks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  These actions were measured, non-ascalatory, proportionate and responsible. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=120.72s)]
*  And this was the response. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  India says it targeted and destroyed nine militant training camps [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=131.6s)]
*  operating in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and beyond. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=135.92s)]
*  Pakistan says dozens of civilians were killed in those attacks. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=142.8s)]
*  Calling the military action an act of war, it is vowing retaliation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=147.12s)]
*  Pakistan reserves the right and will respond to this aggression at a time, place and means of our [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=152.88s)]
*  own choice. As border towns and villages like Salamabad lay abandoned, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=163.12s)]
*  people in the region are left hoping that this brings recent tensions to an end [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  and not merely the beginning of a longer and more protracted conflict. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=175.28s)]
*  Samira Hussain, BBC News, New Delhi. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=180.24s)]
*  The Prime Minister, Sikhiya Stalmers, said the rising tensions over Kashmir will be of serious [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  concern to all communities in Britain. Like others, he is encouraging dialogue and de-escalation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, is with me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump has weighed in tonight. There is always a risk, James, in these circumstances, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=196.96s)]
*  that a response leads to an escalation neither side can stop. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=203.52s)]
*  How does Pakistan respond and what response does it provoke from the Indians? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=209.36s)]
*  The question is whether they can control the escalatory ladder. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=214.88s)]
*  Both sides seem to think they can. They both seem to be saying, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  we are being measured, we are being non-escalatory. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=222.24s)]
*  The risk, though, is one that the Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, and others have [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=224.72s)]
*  pointed out today, which is one of miscalculation. If that happens, there is a risk this spirals out [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=228.0s)]
*  of control and you end up with a regional conflict, maybe a proxy conflict with allies [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=232.96s)]
*  piling in on both sides, or even worse. Remember, we are talking about two countries [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=236.64s)]
*  that possess nuclear weapons, at odds over one of those militarised regions in the world. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=241.12s)]
*  There are two other factors making this harder. One is you have got two walls already in the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=246.8s)]
*  Middle East and Ukraine, that is distracting the international community. Most leaders today have [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=251.2s)]
*  been saying they are playing for restraint and not much more. Secondly, you have got the United [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  States seemingly unwilling to engage diplomatically. Normally they have played a mediating restraining [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=260.4s)]
*  role in this conflict. As you said, President Trump tonight said merely, and I quote, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=266.32s)]
*  if there is anything I can do to help, I will be there. It is not exactly proactive diplomacy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=271.28s)]
*  You have got a distracted international community, you have got a lack of US leadership, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=276.24s)]
*  you have got rising nationalist rhetoric from both sides. It is clearly a very serious situation. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=279.6s)]
*  The stakes are high. James Landa, thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8vmJFnGaU&t=285.36s)]
