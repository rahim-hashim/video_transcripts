Video Description: King Charles has spent a short period of time in hospital after experiencing temporary side effects during cancer treatment, Buckingham Palace has said.
The King has now returned to Clarence House, where he was said to be continuing to work on state papers and make calls from his study. He has cancelled a tour of Birmingham on Friday, acting on medical advice. Charles, 76, had planned to travel to the city for a busy schedule of engagements
A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said meetings with three ambassadors on Thursday were also affected.  "Tomorrow, he was due to undertake four public engagements in Birmingham and is greatly disappointed to be missing them on this occasion," the palace's statement added. "He very much hopes that they can be rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible."
The palace first announced the King's cancer diagnosis in February 2024.  The details of his illness have not been disclosed. A palace source described the latest hospital admission as a "most minor bump in a road that is very much heading in the right direction". The palace did not provide further information over what his side effects were or why they required hospital admission.
Queen Camilla attended a reception in Wembley, north London on Thursday and did not join the King during his brief stay at hospital.

*  This is the effect of his ongoing cancer treatment, that's why he's postponed these [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=24.8s)]
*  engagements. Yes, that's right, it's a reminder of course that the King is still having cancer [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=29.36s)]
*  treatment, that's now been going on for a year or so and this news came via a statement from [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=33.76s)]

*  for observation. We understand he was admitted to the private London clinic in Marylebone in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=55.76s)]
*  central London for a short period earlier today where he was kept under observation before being [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=60.96s)]

*  through state papers and making some phone calls but on the advice of his medical team looking at [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=78.32s)]
*  his programme, looking at what happened today, they have decided it would be best for him not [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=83.44s)]
*  to travel to Birmingham tomorrow where he was due to carry out four engagements there over the course [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=87.6s)]
*  of the day, that it's better that he has the time to rest and recuperate and that he should be back [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=93.2s)]
*  in business next week. Okay, so it's simply a postponement then of these engagements, they [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=98.8s)]
*  will be coming forward later on. Yes, I think it's important to stress in terms of the mood from [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=103.28s)]
*  Buckingham Palace that this isn't one of alarm or drama here. There clearly was a problem earlier [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=108.16s)]
*  today, it's been a bit of a bump in the road for the King in terms of his cancer treatment but he [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=113.92s)]
*  has been carrying out a full schedule of engagements. I've seen him over the past three months, he's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=118.8s)]
*  been really busy, he has looked very well, he's been quite energised by what he's been doing but [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=122.96s)]
*  it is a reminder that a year on after we heard about his cancer diagnosis, a man in his late 70s, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=129.28s)]
*  that there may be problems during his ongoing treatment, there may be blips that need to be [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=135.68s)]
*  dealt with, this is one of those. Buckingham Palace say that he has scheduled engagements next week [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=140.4s)]
*  that they plan to go ahead with at this stage and also he has his state visit to Italy which is due [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=146.32s)]
*  to begin on the 7th of April and as things stand that state visit will go ahead. So the state visit [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=151.6s)]
*  will go ahead, the public shouldn't be alarmed? Yes, that would be very much a message from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=157.68s)]
*  Buckingham Palace. Yes, there have been some problems today, he's a man in his late 70s [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=161.68s)]

*  some time out tomorrow but as things stand next week he will carry on with his schedule of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=170.32s)]
*  engagements and he will be going to Italy on the 7th of April. All right, Daniela thank you, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRa7T0nLps&t=175.04000000000002s)]
