Video Description: Armed gunmen in Syria who carried out a wave of recent sectarian killings of the country’s Alawite minority were monitored by government forces, according to evidence gathered by the BBC. 
One man, Abu Khalid,  said he had travelled as a civilian fighter to the Mediterranean coastal village of Sanobar on 7 March, to help battle former regime insurgents. 
He filmed himself shooting dead a 64-year-old village resident, Mahmoud Yusef Mohammed, at the entrance to his house. Abu Khalid, who has now been arrested, insisted his victim was an armed insurgent.  However video he filmed of the incident does not support his account.   He now says he had been told by the government security officials not to harm civilians but only to shoot at insurgents.
Human rights groups estimate that almost 900 civilians, mainly Alawites, were killed by pro-government forces across Syria's coastal region in early March.  The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam and its followers make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni.  Syria’s former President Bashar al-Assad who fled the country last December is an Alawite.
Syria's coastal area - a stronghold of the former regime - has been largely sealed off, but a BBC team gained access, speaking to witnesses and security officials about what happened in Sanobar.  The violence came a day after fighters loyal to the country's former President led deadly raids on government security forces. 
Syria’s new Sunni Islamist-led government had called for support from various military units and militia groups to respond to those raids – but that escalated into a wave of sectarian anger against Alawite civilians.  
Witnesses told the BBC that several armed groups had targeted Alawites and carried out summary executions. Some also said that government security forces had battled violent and extremist factions in order to protect Alawite villagers from attack.

**BBC - News at Ten:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo)
*  Since the ousting of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in early December, clashes between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=0.0s)]
*  the new government's armed forces and insurgents from the country's minority groups have been [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=5.68s)]
*  frequent. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=10.92s)]
*  In March, the violence was savage, with the former president's Alawite minority community [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=11.92s)]
*  in the coastal region coming under attack. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=16.96s)]
*  Human rights groups estimate some 900 civilians were killed, an apparent response to a series [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=19.84s)]
*  of deadly raids on security forces by rebels loyal to the toppled president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=25.9s)]
*  Well, this part of Syria in Latakia has been largely sealed off since, but Lucy Williamson [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=31.099999999999998s)]
*  and her team has managed to visit the area and track down one of those allegedly involved [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=37.28s)]
*  in the violence. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Her report includes distressing footage of the attacks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  When violence exploded along Syria's coast, Snowbar was right in its path. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=48.58s)]
*  Police say more than 200 people were killed here in March by armed men targeting members [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=54.9s)]
*  of Syria's minority Alawite sect. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=60.1s)]
*  Two months on, many survivors are too afraid to return home or speak to us openly. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=63.46s)]
*  All day many groups entered our house. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=73.46s)]
*  They stole everything, insulted us, threatened the children. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=75.84s)]
*  The last group came around 6pm. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=79.8s)]
*  They took my father and my brother Ali. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=82.24s)]
*  We begged them not to kill them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=84.74s)]
*  They said, you are Alawite pigs and shoot them in front of our eyes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=86.42s)]
*  We kept the body inside the house until we could bury them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=91.58s)]
*  Videos of the killings, many filmed by the gunmen themselves, are now key evidence for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=98.06s)]
*  prosecutors. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=102.86s)]
*  The man on the back of the bike is known as Abu Khalid. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=104.41999999999999s)]
*  The man he's about to shoot is 64-year-old Mahoud Youssef Mohammed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=108.22s)]
*  We tracked Abu Khalid down to a military police facility in Idlib. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=116.46s)]
*  He was keen to talk, telling us that Syria's security forces had allowed armed civilians [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=120.34s)]
*  like him to travel to Snowbar to help battle insurgents, a claim denied by the military [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=125.58s)]
*  police. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=130.96s)]
*  The general security department told us not to harm any civilians, but only to shoot at [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=131.96s)]
*  insurgents who shot at us. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=139.8s)]
*  It was a large group and the general security oversaw things so that no one would vandalise [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=142.32s)]
*  the village or harm the residents. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=148.28s)]
*  He told us he had killed Mahmoud in self-defence and that the 64-year-old had been armed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=152.34s)]
*  But the video he filmed doesn't support his account. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=158.17999999999998s)]
*  Look at the camera, he says, before shooting Mahmoud three times. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=162.34s)]
*  There's no visible weapon near Mahmoud. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  You didn't die, he asks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=173.66s)]
*  Mahmoud can be heard begging for his life as Abu Khalid shoots him again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=176.66s)]
*  But when Abu Khalid weeps, it's not for Mahmoud or even for himself. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=184.9s)]
*  It's for his brother, killed in a bomb attack by Assad's forces in 2018. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=190.36s)]
*  He was eight years old and I carried him in my arms. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=197.84s)]
*  I held him as his soul left his body. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=201.84s)]
*  They ignore everything that happened in Syria before, the bombing and the killing, and they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  focus on the video I filmed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=210.28s)]
*  He insists he didn't kill Mahmoud in sectarian revenge. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=214.46s)]
*  If I was going for revenge for what they did to us, I wouldn't have left any of them, he said. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=218.82s)]
*  Mahmoud's house sits right at the edge of Snowbar, beside the highway where former regime [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=225.1s)]
*  fighters launched deadly attacks the previous day. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=230.3s)]
*  Mahmoud's family told us that his body lay here at the entrance to his house for three [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=235.46s)]
*  days before they were able to bury him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  They told us he was a farmer with a military background who'd come out that day to check [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  on the family home after smelling a fire nearby. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=249.3s)]
*  Residents, many too scared to return, told us that several armed groups rampaged through [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=253.72s)]
*  their villages that day, foreign fighters, civilians and factions now supposedly under [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  government control. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=265.42s)]
*  The region's security chief told me any violations were isolated acts by individuals. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=270.29999999999995s)]
*  His face is covered after receiving threats from Islamic State jihadists. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=276.7s)]
*  Those who were proven to have assaulted civilians have been arrested, whether from factions, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  those affiliated with the government security forces, or the civilians who came to help. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=289.29999999999995s)]
*  They were arrested by the military police. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=294.9s)]
*  Do you accept that some of your forces may have been involved in this? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=297.98s)]
*  These were individual cases and they were arrested. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=303.88s)]
*  After the situation was under control, we began removing all the rioters and arresting [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=307.6s)]
*  anyone who had harmed civilians. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  Government forces are now building trust in Alawite villages by promising protection from [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=317.22s)]
*  the government's own extremist allies. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  But they're also eyeing a continued threat from thousands of former regime fighters hiding [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=325.16s)]
*  in these hills. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=330.56s)]
*  Syria's stability depends on the transfer of military control, not just political power. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=332.88000000000005s)]
*  But until a few months ago, many of Syria's new security forces were rebel fighters with [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  different opposition groups. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=343.86s)]
*  And the enemy they're disarming is not a local militia, but an army. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=346.18s)]
*  The future of Sinobar is a test for the future of Syria. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24VGwdj-Zo&t=355.40000000000003s)]
