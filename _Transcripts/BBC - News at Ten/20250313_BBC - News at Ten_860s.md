Video Description: Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has cast doubt on Russia’s willingness to agree an initial 30-day ceasefire in the war in UKraine, laying down a string of conditions that will be hard to meet.   
Mr Putin said he agreed with the idea of a ceasefire in Ukraine but had  "many questions” about the proposed US-brokered ceasefire. The Russian leader suggested that  Ukraine should neither rearm nor mobilise and that western military aid to Kyiv be halted during the 30-day ceasefire.
Ukraine has already agreed to the proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in talks with the United States.   President Volodymyr Zelensky described Putin's response to the plan as "manipulative”.  US President Donald Trump said it would be “very disappointing” if Russia refused to agree to the ceasefire.  The US has placed further sanctions on Russian oil, gas and banking sectors.

# Putin casts doubt on Ukraine ceasefire plan with string of conditions | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI)
*  While Vladimir Putin says in principle he supports the idea of a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Ukraine, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=0.0s)]
*  it's pretty clear he'll want any truce to be on his terms. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=7.0s)]
*  Speaking ahead of a meeting with Donald Trump's personal envoy in Moscow, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=10.76s)]
*  Russia's leader said there are many details that still need to be ironed out [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=14.8s)]
*  in the deal to pause the fighting already agreed between Ukraine and the US. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=18.76s)]
*  The Kremlin says, for instance, that Kiev must not be allowed to rearm during any truce. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=24.0s)]
*  Tonight, President Zelenskyy said Mr Putin really wants to reject the ceasefire, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=29.6s)]
*  but is simply afraid to tell Donald Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  In a moment, we'll have the view from Washington, but first, James Landale has our top story from Kiev. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=37.4s)]
*  Russian flags flying once again over the border town of Sudzha, according to state media. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=44.32s)]
*  Six months ago, Ukrainian troops seized this part of Russia in the western Kursk region. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  But now Russian special forces and others have fought and claimed it back, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=55.92s)]
*  all of which has put a spring in Vladimir Putin's step, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=61.2s)]
*  today meeting his Belarusian ally and giving his response to American demands for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=64.44s)]
*  We agree with the proposal that the fighting must end, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=74.44s)]
*  but it has to be an agreement that leads to a long-term peace that removes the root causes of the crisis. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  In other words, yes, but no. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=85.04s)]
*  He supports the idea, but qualifies it with numerous questions about what it would mean for Kursk, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=87.52s)]
*  the front line, rearmament, all of which he says demands painstaking study. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=93.64s)]
*  What about issues of control and verification? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=101.72s)]
*  How can it and will it be guaranteed that nothing like this will happen? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=104.76s)]
*  How will controls be organized? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=109.4s)]
*  The problem is that this does not sound like the immediate interim ceasefire [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=112.0s)]
*  agreed by US and Ukrainian negotiators in Saudi Arabia earlier this week. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=116.36s)]
*  President Zelensky said Mr Putin's response was predictable and manipulative, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=122.0s)]
*  setting preconditions to delay a ceasefire as long as possible. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=127.08s)]
*  He is actually preparing a refusal as of now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=133.48s)]
*  Mr Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=136.76s)]
*  wants to kill Ukrainians. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=142.64s)]
*  So all eyes now on Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=145.2s)]
*  He arrived in Moscow for talks with Mr Putin, talks that have just become a lot more complex. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=150.04s)]
*  Today, his boss said Mr Putin's statement was promising, but not complete. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=155.88s)]
*  A lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=161.44s)]
*  Now we're going to see whether or not Russia is there, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=167.04s)]
*  and if they're not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=170.04s)]
*  All the while, Russia continues to make gains in Kursk, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=173.52s)]
*  leaving much of it in ruins, yes, but also leaving Ukraine less able to use it [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  as a bargaining chip in any negotiations to come. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  James Landau, BBC News, Kiev. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=186.24s)]
*  Sarah Smith live at the White House for us tonight. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=189.36s)]
*  Suggestions tonight, Sarah, from Washington, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=192.0s)]
*  Mr Putin's less than fulsome support for the ceasefire deal could have consequences, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=194.6s)]
*  adverse consequences, for Moscow. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=199.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, because I think if Vladimir Putin is playing for time [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=203.84s)]
*  by asking for all these clarifications before he'll agree to a ceasefire, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=207.72s)]
*  he may very quickly start testing Donald Trump's patience. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=211.2s)]
*  The American president spoke to reporters earlier when he was in the Oval Office [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=214.4s)]
*  with the NATO Secretary General Mark Rutter, and he said there, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=218.04s)]
*  this process has to happen fast. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  That's something he's repeated many times before, that this needs to happen quickly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=223.84s)]
*  And as a result, he was, you know, sounding relatively optimistic [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=229.04s)]
*  about what's been going on so far. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  He said he was getting good signals from Moscow [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=234.76s)]
*  and that he himself would love to talk to Vladimir Putin or meet him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  But I think there was a clear warning there as well when he said [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=241.32s)]
*  it would be very disappointing if Russia wouldn't agree to this plan, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=244.04s)]
*  because remember, up until now, Mr Trump has sounded incredibly sympathetic [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=249.2s)]
*  towards what Russia's demands would be in a peace deal. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=254.24s)]
*  And in fact, today he even referenced discussions that had been going on [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=257.28s)]
*  about what pieces of land Ukraine may be forced to give up. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=260.68s)]
*  But if Vladimir Putin will not agree to this 30-day ceasefire [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=264.36s)]
*  and do so relatively soon, he might speedily find that Donald Trump [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=268.84s)]
*  takes a rather less favourable approach. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=273.04s)]
*  All right, Sarah, thank you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=276.2s)]
*  Sarah Smith, our North America editor there at the White House. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, Ukraine has lost around 20% of its land to Russia since the war began [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  and many thousands of troops have died. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  Jonathan Beale has been to eastern Ukraine to talk to some of those on the front line. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=287.56s)]
*  There may be talk of a ceasefire, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=294.76s)]
*  but here in eastern Ukraine, it's in a parallel universe. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=297.32s)]
*  It's still wave after wave of wounded soldiers. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=302.08s)]
*  These, the less critically injured. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  SIRENS [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=308.44s)]
*  Transported by bus to hospital, a few dozen at a time. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=310.44s)]
*  HONKING [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=314.76s)]
*  It's just multiple shrapnel in different areas of the body. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=316.44s)]
*  Most of these were defending just one location, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=321.24s)]
*  the besieged city of Pokrovsk. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  These injuries just the tip of an iceberg. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=326.84s)]
*  And few believe there'll soon be any pause in the fighting. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=330.12s)]
*  They storm our positions every day, pretty much every day. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=337.4s)]
*  I doubt there will be a truce. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=342.12s)]
*  I've already lost a lot of my friends. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=347.48s)]
*  I would like to believe that all will be good. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=350.48s)]
*  But you can't trust Russia, never. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=354.0s)]
*  If you know your history, that's clear. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=357.0s)]
*  Sometimes they have to do this evacuation several times a day. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=360.88s)]
*  22-year-old Sophia, a medic, is preparing for the next one. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  And she doesn't believe President Putin will stop. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=372.4s)]
*  I mean, if they wanted peace, they would have stopped this war. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=375.88s)]
*  The person cannot change, like, overnight, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=379.56s)]
*  oh, I want peace now, you know, wake up and I want peace. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=383.56s)]
*  I'm a peaceful person today. It doesn't change like that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=387.0s)]
*  GUNSHOTS [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=390.8s)]
*  As yet no sign the bombs and bullets will fall silent. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=393.8s)]
*  And without a diplomatic breakthrough, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=398.04s)]
*  Ukraine's ready to carry on the fight. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=400.16s)]
*  Hold on! Hold on! [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=402.6s)]
*  In a brief rest from the front, these troops continue their training. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=404.76s)]
*  While there's talk of peace, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  these Ukrainian soldiers are still preparing for war. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=413.04s)]
*  In a few days' time, if our field is trending, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=417.48s)]
*  they'll be back on the front line. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=419.88s)]
*  And here there is deep scepticism that the fighting will end. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=422.36s)]
*  GUNSHOTS [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=426.72s)]
*  One hope for Ukraine is that America's back on side. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=429.72s)]
*  These troops need that support to maintain their US-made armoured vehicle. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=433.48s)]
*  A ceasefire has the support of President Trump, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=439.48s)]
*  while President Putin still has questions. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=443.04s)]
*  Do you trust Putin? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=446.4s)]
*  Ivan says, no, never. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=448.4s)]
*  Do you trust President Trump? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=450.4s)]
*  Lately, he says, he's had his doubts. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=453.4s)]
*  Confidence for a ceasefire isn't high. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=457.4s)]
*  But prevarication by President Putin over efforts to end the war [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=460.4s)]
*  could bolster support for Ukraine. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=465.4s)]
*  Jonathan Beale, BBC News, Eastern Ukraine. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=468.4s)]
*  For Poland, Ukraine's neighbour to the west, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=473.4s)]
*  there is a very real fear Russia might attack them. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=475.4s)]
*  And in response, defence spending has just been dramatically ramped up [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=478.4s)]
*  to the highest level of any NATO country in proportion to its GDP. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=482.4s)]
*  Now, the country's president has told the BBC [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=487.4s)]
*  he wants US nuclear weapons on Polish territory as a deterrent. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=489.4s)]
*  He's been speaking to, in Warsaw, to Jeremy Bowen. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=494.4s)]
*  Poland is a country where memories of the past, wars, invasion, occupation [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=499.4s)]
*  shape the way they see the present. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=504.4s)]
*  Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=507.4s)]
*  greeting the Mongolian president in Warsaw, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=510.4s)]
*  is also commander-in-chief of their rapidly expanding armed forces. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=513.4s)]
*  He sees Putin's Russia as every bit as dangerous as the former Soviet Union, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=518.4s)]
*  Poland's overlord for 40 years after the Second World War. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=524.4s)]
*  Can we talk a bit about Poland's security? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=528.4s)]
*  You've said that you would like the United States to move nuclear weapons, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=530.4s)]
*  to keep them, to station them here in Poland. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=536.4s)]
*  How does that make you more secure? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=539.4s)]
*  We have been talking about this for a very long time. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=543.4s)]
*  This is not new information. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=546.4s)]
*  And it has been the subject of talks with successive US administrations. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=548.4s)]
*  This is nothing new. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=551.4s)]
*  They've always said no. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=554.4s)]
*  Of course, there was a question from a journalist asking whether we are interested [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=556.4s)]
*  in the French nuclear umbrella in line with President Emmanuel Macron's statements. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=561.4s)]
*  I said that, of course, because any nuclear protection would be valuable to us, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=566.4s)]
*  just like American nuclear sharing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=571.4s)]
*  We have been advocating for nuclear sharing for many years. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=574.4s)]
*  So far, no decision has been made on this matter, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=577.4s)]
*  but I am very clear that, from my point of view, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=580.4s)]
*  Poland's position on this remains unchanged. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=583.4s)]
*  But I'm interested in why you think that actually having the physical presence [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=589.4s)]
*  of American nuclear weapons on your soil makes you any safer. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=593.4s)]
*  Wouldn't the Russians see that as a big provocation? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=596.4s)]
*  First of all, we believe this is a matter of security. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=601.4s)]
*  This weapon is not an offensive weapon. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=604.4s)]
*  It is a defensive one. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=606.4s)]
*  I want to emphasize once again that this is a weapon designed primarily [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=608.4s)]
*  to defend against a nuclear attack. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=611.4s)]
*  Secondly, it is Russia, without asking anyone's opinion, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=615.4s)]
*  that has relocated its nuclear weapons to Belarus. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=618.4s)]
*  This is no secret. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=621.4s)]
*  Even Putin openly talked about it in a televised interview. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=623.4s)]
*  So far, it is Russia that is employing an offensive strategy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=626.4s)]
*  And let me stress that Russia is the aggressor. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=629.4s)]
*  Russia attacked Ukraine without any reason and without any provocation whatsoever. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=632.4s)]
*  That's why I say this. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=637.4s)]
*  NATO should implement a defensive strategy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=639.4s)]
*  A defensive strategy means responding to Russia's actions, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=642.4s)]
*  and I believe such a response is necessary. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=645.4s)]
*  The response should be the relocation of nuclear weapons to NATO member states. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=648.4s)]
*  We, as Poland, are ready to host these nuclear weapons. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=652.4s)]
*  There are American nuclear weapons in Germany. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=659.4s)]
*  There's Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, to which you're a signatory, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=661.4s)]
*  which is the mutual defense clause in that. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=665.4s)]
*  Why does physically having American weapons here make you any safer? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=668.4s)]
*  Because you're protected anyway, aren't you, by Article 5? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=673.4s)]
*  Every piece of strategic US and NATO infrastructure on our soil [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=679.4s)]
*  strengthens the United States and NATO's commitment to defending this territory. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=683.4s)]
*  But do you think that Trump actually would honor Article 5? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=690.4s)]
*  Article 5 is the foundation of NATO's existence. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=695.4s)]
*  If there ever came a time when Article 5 was not upheld, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=698.4s)]
*  then the very existence of the Alliance in its current form would be meaningless. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=701.4s)]
*  Don't you think, though, it's been very damaging the way that Article 5 has been brought into question [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=706.4s)]
*  by some of the things that Donald Trump and his senior advisors [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=712.4s)]
*  have been saying about their commitment to Europe? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=717.4s)]
*  People are doubting it now. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=721.4s)]
*  Trump argues, why should the American taxpayer fund the defense of these countries [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=725.4s)]
*  when they are not even investing in their own security? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=729.4s)]
*  There is some logic to this argument. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=732.4s)]
*  However, I think it's primarily a negotiating tactic. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=734.4s)]
*  Trump is bargaining, making his position clear, and in a way issuing a warning. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=737.4s)]
*  The tomb of Poland's unknown soldier is never left unguarded. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=745.4s)]
*  Poland carries the scars of generations of trouble with Russia. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=749.4s)]
*  They are not certain that their European allies understand the Polish point [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=753.4s)]
*  that they need to spend big on defense now. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=758.4s)]
*  Well, Jeremy, Poland's ramping up security, as you've shown, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=764.4s)]
*  like other nations in Europe. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=767.4s)]
*  One wonders if Mr Putin's decision so far not to back a ceasefire in Ukraine [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=768.4s)]
*  perhaps confirms some of their worst fears. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=773.4s)]
*  You know, they absolutely, Clive, believe that they understand Russia 100%. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=777.4s)]
*  Russia was their overlord effectively here in Poland [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=782.4s)]
*  for 40 years after the Second World War. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=786.4s)]
*  They believe that they have to get armed up to deal with what they believe [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=788.4s)]
*  is a threat as serious at any point in the Cold War from the Russians. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=793.4s)]
*  Now, as for the wider issue about trying to get a ceasefire and a peace deal in Ukraine, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=798.4s)]
*  it's not clear to me that President Trump and the people around him [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=804.4s)]
*  really get the idea that for both Ukraine and for Russia, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=808.4s)]
*  it's not just about control of land or indeed about business opportunities [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=812.4s)]
*  or business deals if a deal is done. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=817.4s)]
*  For both Ukraine and for Russia, it's about bigger things. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=820.4s)]
*  It's about existence, independence, and sovereignty for the Ukrainians. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=824.4s)]
*  For the Russians, it's about how Mr Putin particularly sees the way [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=830.4s)]
*  his country needs to be, if it's going to be a big power. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=835.4s)]
*  And for him, that includes Ukraine once more under the control of Moscow [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=839.4s)]
*  as it has been in the past for so many years. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=845.4s)]
*  And that's what makes this such a hard war to try to negotiate an end to. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=848.4s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=854.4s)]
*  All right, Jeremy, many thanks. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=855.4s)]
*  Jeremy Bowen, our international editor there live in Warsaw. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=856.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzjLGIOaXI&t=860.4s)]
