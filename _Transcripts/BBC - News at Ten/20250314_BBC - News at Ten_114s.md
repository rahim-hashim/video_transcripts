Video Description: Shares in Tesla, the electric vehicle-maker owned by Elon Musk, have plunged, losing all the gains they have mades since Donald Trump’s election victory.
Investors are concerned about plunging sales figures which come as Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk is playing a divisive role in as a member of the Trump administration.
It’s emerged that Tesla has sent an unsigned letter to US trade officials that Trump’s tariffs risk provoking punishing retaliatory tariffs from other countries against US carmakers that may damage sales.
The letter says that Tesla “supports fair trade” but that the US administration should ensure it does not “inadvertently harm US companies”.
