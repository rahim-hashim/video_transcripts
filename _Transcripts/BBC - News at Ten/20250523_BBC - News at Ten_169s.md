Video Description: In an exclusive interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan, Liverpool’s head coach Arne Slot has said that excuses are "for teams that don't win the league" and it is "nice" his side won the Premier League so he does not have to rely on them.
Reflecting on leading the club to a 20th top-flight title in his first year since succeeding Jurgen Klopp, the Dutchman told BBC Sport of his pride at the achievement, despite some challenges.
He said:  “All these excuses you could give to Liverpool... with us maybe not spending... or not bringing new players in, or taking over from someone.... All these things are excuses for teams that don't win the league, and it's nice that if you have all these excuses, that you don't have to use them, but you still just won it."
Liverpool secured the title without any serious strengthening of the squad Slot inherited, which he said made it "probably even more special".  And he drew comparisons with his time at Feyenoord, where he won the Eredivisie in 2023 despite an overhaul of his team.  "I did it now in two different leagues and in two different ways.”
Recently the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lamented how “red cards and injuries” had impacted on his team’s title bid.   Last season’s Premier League winners Manchester City cited similar problems with injuries to key players for the club’s failure to present a sustained challenge to Liverpool.
In a wide-ranging interview conducted at the club's training ground before Liverpool's final match of the season against Crystal Palace on Sunday, Slot also spoke of his "hope” that Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a "positive" send-off, after he was booed by some fans following confirmation he will leave his boyhood club next month.
Slot also said he would"cherish for the rest of my life" his team’s open bus parade through Liverpool to celebrate winning the title.
He disputed Arteta's argument that teams had to be in "the right place at the right time" to win the Premier League, suggesting that over a long and arduous season it was clear that the best team won.
He insisted he was "not worried" about the uncertainty that surrounded key players Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk before they signed contract extensions and said it would be "stupid" not to strengthen the squad this summer, although he admitted that the club may not be able to bring in the players they most want.
Jane Hill presents Arne Slot’s exclusive interview with BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan.

# Arne Slot: Excuses are for teams that don’t win the League | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU)
*  Liverpool's head coach Arna Slott has told the BBC that excuses are for teams that don't win the league. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=0.0s)]
*  In an exclusive interview, the Dutchman, who's just won the Premier League at the first attempt, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=6.24s)]
*  also said he hopes Trent Alexander-Arnold gets a positive farewell in his final game this weekend. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=11.24s)]
*  He's been talking to our sports editor, Dan Roan. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=17.76s)]
*  Liverpool are the champions of England in Arna Slott's first season in the country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=21.56s)]
*  He's the Dutch football manager that's made almost the perfect start to his time at Anfield. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=28.479999999999997s)]
*  Arna Slott's been celebrating leading Liverpool to the Premier League title, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=33.4s)]
*  defying expectations after taking over from legendary former coach Jurgen Klopp. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=37.28s)]
*  Ahead of the final game of the season, I met him at the club's training ground to reflect on his success. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=42.28s)]
*  Is it hard to believe sometimes just what you've achieved in your first season here? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=47.8s)]
*  Not as much now anymore. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=51.84s)]
*  I think the moment the referee blew his whistle, you were like, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=53.2s)]
*  wow, this has really happened. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=57.12s)]
*  But now, after all the celebrations, it definitely sinked in. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=59.8s)]
*  And all the excuses that have always been made if a team doesn't win the league, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=64.16s)]
*  it's nice that if you have all these excuses that you don't have to use them, but you still just want it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=67.8s)]
*  Jurgen left this team in a great place because the culture of this team has been a joy to step into. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=74.0s)]
*  There have been issues to navigate. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=80.44s)]
*  Having confirmed he was leaving his boyhood club at the end of the season, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=82.24s)]
*  Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold was booed by some fans. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=85.84s)]
*  What would your hopes be in terms of the reaction to him when he gets his winner's medal? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  It would be fantastic if it's only going to be a positive moment for everyone at the club. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=95.72s)]
*  And Trent is part of that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=101.12s)]
*  I hope every player gets what he deserves for what he did this season. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=102.36s)]
*  Do you realistically now need to strengthen this summer? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=107.2s)]
*  City will probably strengthen the squad again. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=110.76s)]
*  If the rumours are correct, Arsenal is planning the same. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  So it would be stupid if we are not looking. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=116.04s)]
*  It's not that easy because this team has already won the league. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  There are certain players in the world where I think, if they would come, it would be nice. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=122.8s)]
*  But they're also playing at clubs where they don't want to leave. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=126.56s)]
*  We will try to get them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=129.6s)]
*  How special will that be for you to go on that bus parade with hundreds of thousands of Liverpool fans? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=131.84s)]
*  I think these moments will be one of the most special moments in your life. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=137.76s)]
*  Professional-wise, maybe the most special moment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  And to do this with 100,000 people, which were there at Feyenoord, was very special. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=146.28s)]
*  But to do it with a multiple of that will probably be a once in a lifetime experience. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=150.48s)]
*  Although we are planning to win a few things more at this club. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=157.28s)]
*  So let's hope it's not going to be the last time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  But it's going to be a moment that I will cherish for the rest of my life. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zKiDLqBmUU&t=165.35999999999999s)]
