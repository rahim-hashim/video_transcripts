# Mid-East Crisis escalates - Iran rains missiles on Israel after attacks on nuclear sites | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU)
*  Iran has tonight launched retaliatory strikes on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran's Revolutionary Guard says it attacked dozens of targets, including military centers and air bases. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Smoke has been seen rising over the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv after an aerial attack on the Israeli city. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=10.64s)]
*  Explosions have also been heard in Jerusalem. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=17.2s)]
*  Tonight's bombardment is in retaliation for Israel's strikes on Iran last night, which targeted military and nuclear sites. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=20.16s)]
*  Israel said the attacks were vital to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=27.8s)]
*  The country's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, promised his country would inflict heavy blows in response. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=32.96s)]
*  Well, this was the scene in Tel Aviv in Israel just an hour or two ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=40.96s)]
*  There have been huge explosions in the sky over central Israel, although it is unclear what's from missile strikes and what is Israel intercepting them with its iron dome. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=46.28s)]
*  Tonight, Israel says it struck a nuclear facility in Isfahan. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=57.44s)]
*  And that is in addition to last night's strikes on the country's biggest nuclear facility at Natanz and also at Comanche. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, our first report tonight is from Lucy Williamson, who's in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=70.92s)]
*  In bunkers and stairwells, they listened. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=78.28s)]
*  To Tel Aviv, under fire from Iran. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=81.72s)]
*  Defenses scrambling above a city of civilians and military bases. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=85.4s)]
*  From ballistic missiles arriving minutes after launch. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=90.68s)]
*  Impacts felt inside shaking buildings. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=95.32s)]
*  For the third time tonight, missiles are being fired at Israel, fired at Tel Aviv. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=101.4s)]
*  This is the response, Israel. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=107.0s)]
*  This is the response Israel was expecting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=109.48s)]
*  And all across the country, people are listening to the sound of Israel and Iran at war. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=112.48s)]
*  Missile defense systems were also activated over Jerusalem. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=119.08s)]
*  Israeli media reported several impacts across the country, including near military sites. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=123.48s)]
*  A direct hit to this building reportedly left people trapped inside. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=129.72s)]
*  Israel began striking Iran overnight. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  A nuclear enrichment site at Natanz, one of the first to be hit. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=137.8s)]
*  A target for Israel's prime minister for decades. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=142.0s)]
*  Hit in what he said was a last chance to stop Iran making a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=145.12s)]
*  Air defenses, missile sites, nuclear scientists and military leaders, including the head of Iran's armed forces, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=150.56s)]
*  wiped out in a series of nationwide strikes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=158.56s)]
*  An attack involving 200 fighter planes working with covert intelligence teams at a secret base inside Iran. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=163.2s)]
*  These pictures from Israel's spy agency are said to show commandos firing at a missile launcher during this morning's attack. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=172.2s)]
*  Their prime minister said the clock on Iran's nuclear ambitions had run out. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=180.2s)]
*  Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=184.2s)]
*  to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=191.2s)]
*  This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=196.2s)]
*  For decades, the tyrants of Tehran have brazenly, openly called for Israel's destruction. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=201.2s)]
*  In Iran, hundreds of protesters called for revenge. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=210.2s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader said Israel had made an enormous miscalculation [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=214.2s)]
*  and that the consequences would bring it to ruin. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=219.2s)]
*  They should not imagine that they struck and it's over. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=226.2s)]
*  No, they started this. They launched a war. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=229.2s)]
*  We will not allow them to escape unscathed from the major crime they have committed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=233.2s)]
*  We will not allow them to escape unscathed from the major crime they have committed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=238.2s)]
*  Iran has also now reported unconfirmed signs of radiation at the Natanz nuclear site. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=243.2s)]
*  I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=249.2s)]
*  I reiterate that any military action that jeopardizes the safety and security of nuclear facilities [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=256.2s)]
*  risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region and beyond. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=262.2s)]
*  A former general in Israel's air force said there were limits to what military force could achieve. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=269.2s)]
*  I think we can say pretty much easily this was the most complicated [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=274.2s)]
*  and actually complicated, probably dangerous operation that Israel ever did in its history. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=280.2s)]
*  We have a huge military success, a huge one. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=289.2s)]
*  Okay, what's the next step? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=293.2s)]
*  Are we going to transform it to something that will say, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=296.2s)]
*  okay, the region is safe for the next 50 years, not having any nuclear threats from Iran? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=301.2s)]
*  Tonight Israel was still striking across the country. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=307.2s)]
*  This explosion filmed in West Tehran. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=311.2s)]
*  Others reported at nuclear facilities in Esfahan and Fordow. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=314.2s)]
*  Israel says Iran was secretly building a nuclear bomb. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=320.2s)]
*  Too big a risk, it said. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=324.2s)]
*  But Iran may now decide that negotiations won't protect it from attack and that a nuclear weapon will. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=326.2s)]
*  Well, the alerts have been lifted for now in Tel Aviv, but Israel's attack isn't over. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=336.2s)]
*  There's a drone just flying above us here and the threat, of course, hasn't gone as well. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=341.2s)]
*  Israel's prime minister tonight had a message directly for the Iranian people saying [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=346.2s)]
*  Israel's fight was not with them, it was with their government. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=352.2s)]
*  The time has come, he said, to stand up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=355.2s)]
*  And that strengthened the view that some people here have that Benjamin Netanyahu's goal [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=362.2s)]
*  is not just to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, but its regime as a whole. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=367.2s)]
*  Thanks so much, Lucy Williamson, there in Tel Aviv. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=374.2s)]
*  Let's assess the situation in Jerusalem as well. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=377.2s)]
*  Our correspondent, Ioni Wells, is there. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=379.2s)]
*  What's the latest where you are, Ioni? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=382.2s)]
*  I saw a series of drones fly over Jerusalem, followed by some big explosions and bangs. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=385.2s)]
*  Now, it's not clear if those were the sounds of strikes or interceptions by Israel's defense system. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=398.2s)]
*  Israel has said that the majority of drones and missiles that were fired by Iran were either intercepted or fell short. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=403.2s)]
*  Minutes before that, we had all received this emergency alert. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=411.2s)]
*  Sirens were going off here in the same way that they did at 3 a.m. this morning, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=414.2s)]
*  urging people to go to shelter or remain very close to them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=419.2s)]
*  This was after Iran confirmed that it was launching retaliatory military strikes on central Israel [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=423.2s)]
*  after a series of Israeli strikes on Iran today. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=429.2s)]
*  Now, for now, that emergency alert has subsided. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=432.2s)]
*  People are being urged to remain cautious. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=435.2s)]
*  But as the last 24 hours of evidence, that could change again very quickly. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=438.2s)]
*  Ioni, thank you. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=442.2s)]
*  Ioni Wells, well, this isn't the first conflict between Israel and Iran, but it is the most explosive. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=444.2s)]
*  The risks are huge. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=450.2s)]
*  Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, is here. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=452.2s)]
*  Frank. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=454.2s)]
*  Well, Jane, this conflict is bigger, more extensive and potentially more dangerous than anything that's gone before. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=455.2s)]
*  The targets hit range right across Iran. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=463.2s)]
*  It's the biggest assault on that country since the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=466.2s)]
*  One of the principal targets was Natanz, around 200 miles south of Tehran. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=471.2s)]
*  Tonight, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog says it's been destroyed. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=477.2s)]
*  It was Iran's chief uranium enrichment facility. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=481.2s)]
*  That's a process that can have both peaceful and military purposes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=484.2s)]
*  Tonight, Israel said it also hit a nuclear site in Isfahan. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=488.2s)]
*  And in the western city of Kerman Shah, new footage of Israeli airstrikes. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=493.2s)]
*  Missile bases have been struck across the country. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=499.2s)]
*  On top of this, key military figures have been assassinated. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=502.2s)]
*  Major General Hossein Salama, the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=506.2s)]
*  Major General Mohammed Bagheri, head of Iran's armed forces. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=510.2s)]
*  And Brigadier General Amir Harjizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards Air Force. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=514.2s)]
*  Also targeted, at least six nuclear scientists. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=520.2s)]
*  So how is this being viewed by the Iranian public? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=523.2s)]
*  The mood in the country is really divided. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=527.2s)]
*  Some people, they're supporters of the Iranian establishment. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=529.2s)]
*  They are angry, they're furious, they want revenge. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=532.2s)]
*  However, there are some other Iranians, those who have been repressed in the over, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=535.2s)]
*  in the past four decades by the Iranian regime, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=540.2s)]
*  they are quite happy that the top Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders are killed. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=543.2s)]
*  Now back in 2015, Iran was enriching uranium to just 3.6%, enough for civil nuclear power. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=549.2s)]
*  Today, it's 60%, closer to what's needed for a bomb. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=556.2s)]
*  But it was Donald Trump, close ally of Israel, who pulled the US out of a hard-won deal [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=561.2s)]
*  to curb Iran's enrichment. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=567.2s)]
*  Today, he's ordered more US naval forces to the Middle East, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=569.2s)]
*  amid fears that Iran could hit US bases. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=573.2s)]
*  And there's another risk that Israel's operation could even backfire. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=576.2s)]
*  The military strikes from Israel are likely to expedite a thinking inside Iran [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=582.2s)]
*  about the fact that a nuclear bomb is the only real insurance that the Iranian leadership has [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=588.2s)]
*  against a major Israeli or US-led attack that targets the core of the leadership. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=594.2s)]
*  So look, in purely tactical terms, Israel, which don't forget is a nuclear power, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=602.2s)]
*  has achieved military success. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=607.2s)]
*  It struck deep into Iran and assassinated top commanders. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=609.2s)]
*  But this isn't the end. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=613.2s)]
*  If Iran's regime survives, it may well now race to build a bomb, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=614.2s)]
*  setting off a nuclear arms race across the Middle East. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=619.2s)]
*  Jane. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=623.2s)]
*  Frank, thank you, Frank Gardner. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=624.2s)]
*  Well, Israel's attacks come as the US and Iran are trying to reach a deal on Tehran's nuclear program. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=626.2s)]
*  Talks are meant to resume this weekend. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=633.2s)]
*  President Trump has urged Iran to make a deal. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=635.2s)]
*  Warning of even more brutal Israeli attacks if it doesn't. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=638.2s)]
*  Tonight, the Prime Minister, Sikir Starmer, spoke with President Trump. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=642.2s)]
*  The men say they agreed on the importance of diplomacy and dialogue [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=645.2s)]
*  to resolve this mounting conflict between Iran and Israel. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=650.2s)]
*  Tom Bateman reports. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=654.2s)]
*  A superpower at sea to defend its ally. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=657.2s)]
*  Tonight, the US confirmed it helped Israel shoot down Iranian missiles. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=661.2s)]
*  This sharp escalation after President Trump had been erring on the side of diplomacy. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=666.2s)]
*  As Israel attacked overnight, Washington warned Iran not to hit back at American bases, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=672.2s)]
*  saying it wasn't involved. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=678.2s)]
*  But by this morning, Mr Trump was on the offensive, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=680.2s)]
*  saying Tehran's hardliners had lost the fight to get their terms on the nuclear deal. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=683.2s)]
*  They're all dead now, he said, and it will only get worse. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=689.2s)]
*  There has already been great death and destruction. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=693.2s)]
*  But there is still time to make this slaughter, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=695.2s)]
*  with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=698.2s)]
*  In accordance with rule 39... [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=703.2s)]
*  Tonight, the UN Security Council has been meeting in emergency session to discuss the crisis. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=705.2s)]
*  Amid the calls for de-escalation, the Americans warned about further consequences. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=711.2s)]
*  No government, proxy or independent actor should target American citizens, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=716.2s)]
*  American bases or other American infrastructure in the region. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=724.2s)]
*  The consequences for Iran would be dire. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=730.2s)]
*  We strongly and unequivocally condemn the barbaric and criminal attack, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=735.2s)]
*  a series of targeted assassinations against senior military officials, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=741.2s)]
*  nuclear scientists and innocent civilians. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=747.2s)]
*  The Israeli leader has long pushed Mr Trump for a green light to strike Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=752.2s)]
*  Timing was critical after Israel destroyed many Iranian air defences last year [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=759.2s)]
*  and wiped out much of the deterrent effect of Hezbollah on its own border. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=765.2s)]
*  Mr Netanyahu argued now was the time to strike. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=770.2s)]
*  But Mr Trump, via his envoy Steve Wyckoff, turned instead to rounds of talks with the Iranians, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=774.2s)]
*  meaning this close but often fractious relationship was under even more strain. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=780.2s)]
*  Mr Trump told the Israelis publicly and privately he wanted more time for talks, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=785.2s)]
*  leading to a tense 40-minute phone call on Monday. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=790.2s)]
*  There's a chance of massive conflict. We have a lot of American people in this area. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=794.2s)]
*  And I said, we've got to tell them to get out. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=798.2s)]
*  Mr Trump said he was losing confidence in the talks, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=801.2s)]
*  but as late as yesterday was still equivocating over an Israeli strike. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=804.2s)]
*  I'd much prefer an agreement. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=808.2s)]
*  As long as I think there is an agreement, I don't want them going in because I think I would blow it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=810.2s)]
*  It might help it, actually, but it also could blow it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=815.2s)]
*  It comes in a region on edge. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=819.2s)]
*  Some American embassies and bases are already partly evacuated. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=821.2s)]
*  At home, Mr Trump has been preparing for his big military parade. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=826.2s)]
*  His hope now is that his allies' deadly pressure pushes Iran towards a nuclear deal on his terms. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=830.2s)]
*  His opponents are already accusing him of enabling a reckless gamble, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=837.2s)]
*  risking America getting dragged into a war with Iran. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=842.2s)]
*  Tom Bateman, BBC News, Washington. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=846.2s)]
*  Well, in a moment, we'll get the thoughts of Lisa Sett, who is here with me. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=849.2s)]
*  First, though, let's head to Washington and join Gary O'Donoghue. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=853.2s)]
*  And that's one of the key questions where you are, Gary. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=857.2s)]
*  Can the US avoid being dragged into this? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=860.2s)]
*  Well, the administration's position has clearly evolved over the last 20 hours. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=864.2s)]
*  We started with the Secretary of State describing it as a unilateral action. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=869.2s)]
*  Now, today, Donald Trump talking about it being an excellent piece of action involving great American hardware. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=874.2s)]
*  And indeed, we're now learning that Americans are involved in helping intercept these missiles coming in. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=880.2s)]
*  It comes with domestic risks for the president. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=886.2s)]
*  Yes, there's strong support for Israel, but there also is strong animosity to any further involvement in Middle East wars [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=889.2s)]
*  and the 40,000 US troops that are in the region. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=896.2s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump, you know, he's always talked about promises made, promises kept. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=900.2s)]
*  And politics is about the deliverables. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=905.2s)]
*  If you look at Ukraine, if you look at the hostages in Gaza, if you look at getting Iran to do a deal, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=908.2s)]
*  I think this president is finding the process of delivering harder than he thought it would be. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=915.2s)]
*  Thanks, Gary. Gary O'Donoghue. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=921.2s)]
*  And Lisa Zett is our chief international correspondent, of course. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=923.2s)]
*  And people watching, Lisa, will want to know what will happen? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=926.2s)]
*  Where will this go now? But it is so unpredictable. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=930.2s)]
*  So unpredictable and so perilous. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=933.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel is making it clear he's waited a long time for this moment, and he's not going to waste it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=936.2s)]
*  We have seen in the war across the region over nearly two years now that the guardrails are off. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=942.2s)]
*  So now Mr. Netanyahu is saying he wants to destroy Iran's weapons-making capability. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=947.2s)]
*  What does that mean? How far will it go? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=954.2s)]
*  All we know on day one is that it's going to take days with all of the dangers of escalation, both deliberate and accidental. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=956.2s)]
*  But there are Iranian hardliners who also have been waiting to have a go at Israel. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=964.2s)]
*  They believe they were held back last year, told to exercise restraint, and now they literally are calling the shots. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=968.2s)]
*  So day one, Israeli and Iranian civilians are being hurt and killed. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=975.2s)]
*  There's growing fears about the danger of contamination and leakage. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=980.2s)]
*  And finally, Prime Minister Netanyahu has also been making clear, as we heard in this program, he wants Iranians to use this moment to rise up. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=984.2s)]
*  Many do want to see the back of the regime, but many don't. And that, too, could be explosive. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=992.2s)]
*  Leis, as ever, thank you. Leis Dissette. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGcVu2noaUU&t=998.2s)]
