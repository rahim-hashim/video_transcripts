Video Description: President Trump has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine.  The decision affects supplies of ammunition, weapons and other equipment, including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president.  If sustained it would be likely to have a devastating impact on Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russian forces occupying the country.
The announcement follows the angry scenes at a news conference at the White House last week, where Donald Trump told Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky that he was disrespectful and ungrateful towards the US and “gambling with a third world war”.
Ukraine’s president responded to news of the suspension of support with a statement on social media in which he said he was “ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership” to negotiate a peace deal with Russia.  He also said he would sign up immediately to a deal allowing the United States to exploit Ukraine’s mineral resources. 
The Trump administration has also imposed huge trade tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, something Mr Trump has been threatening since he returned to the White House in January.   Washington  imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada and Mexico, and has increased a levy on goods coming from China.
The Canadian prime minister announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that the trade war would be costly for both countries.  Trudeau accused the US president of planning "a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us.  That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state," he told reporters.

# Trump ends Ukraine military aid and begins trade war with Canada, Mexico, China | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y)
*  Five weeks into Donald Trump's presidency and established norms in war and in trade [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  have been completely upended, with the president deciding to suspend military aid to Ukraine, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=5.5s)]
*  a move praised by Russia, and to impose huge tariffs on the US's main trading partners, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=11.08s)]
*  Canada, Mexico and China. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  The pausing of aid followed last week's unprecedented clash in the White House between Presidents [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=19.84s)]
*  Trump and Zelensky. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=24.76s)]
*  Today Mr Zelensky described the angry exchange as regrettable and said it is time to make [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=26.92s)]
*  things right, indicating he was now ready to work with the US on a peace deal. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  But there was fury from another quarter, from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, whose [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=37.8s)]
*  country now faces US tariffs, that is taxes on their exports of 25%. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  It led to the latest outbreak of starkly undiplomatic language, with Mr Trudeau describing Mr Trump's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=48.96s)]
*  decision as a very dumb thing to do. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=54.72s)]
*  With the latest here's Sarah Smith in Washington. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=57.72s)]
*  Very hard to do business he means if President Zelensky will not do exactly what Donald Trump [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=84.72s)]
*  tells him to. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=93.44s)]
*  So he yanked away American military support to force Mr Zelensky to agree to America's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  terms no matter how favourable they may seem towards Russia. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=99.52s)]
*  The European leaders who have rallied around Ukraine don't want to get on the wrong side [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=104.08s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=108.36s)]
*  They appear to have persuaded Mr Zelensky to offer him an olive branch. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=110.12s)]
*  In a statement on X, he promised to work for a limited truce under what he called President [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=114.38s)]
*  Trump's strong leadership. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=118.86s)]
*  We really do value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=120.33999999999999s)]
*  independence he said. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=125.06s)]
*  And that the row in the White House was regrettable, it's now time to make things right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=127.22s)]
*  On that critical minerals economic deal that Donald Trump is so eager to agree, Ukraine [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=132.9s)]
*  is now ready to sign it at any time according to President Zelensky. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=138.01999999999998s)]
*  Vice President JD Vance has long believed that American support for Ukraine is a waste [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=144.22s)]
*  of money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  Today he said it's not the public posturing that matters but what happens behind the scenes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=150.14s)]
*  The public stuff doesn't matter nearly as much as what are the Ukrainians doing to meaningfully [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=154.92s)]
*  engage on what a peaceful settlement would look like. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=160.5s)]
*  We need the Ukrainians privately to come to us and say this is what we need, this is what [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=163.61999999999998s)]
*  we want, this is how we're going to participate in the process to end this conflict. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=168.54s)]
*  That is the most important thing and that lack of private engagement is what is most [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=173.6s)]
*  concerning to us. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=177.16s)]
*  Russian drones attack towns in northeastern Ukraine overnight. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=179.44s)]
*  Without American military support, Ukraine will find it harder to fight back. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=183.04s)]
*  A pause in US aid does not mean a pause in the fighting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine can keep going albeit with a depleted arsenal and Russia will be eager to make the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=191.48s)]
*  most of this battlefield advantage. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  War places a heavy burden on our nation's extraordinary military families. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=197.72s)]
*  Later tonight Donald Trump returns to Congress to deliver a speech he says is going to be [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=201.84s)]
*  big and he will want to make a big announcement on Ukraine. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=206.0s)]
*  Reshaping global conflicts to suit his schedule is now part of Donald Trump's playbook as [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=210.72s)]
*  he's the one making the rules. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=215.88s)]
*  Well more from Sarah at the White House now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=219.08s)]
*  Sarah, as you said, President Trump is due to deliver that major speech to Congress in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  a few hours. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=226.0s)]
*  Where might this go? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=227.0s)]
*  Yeah, well we haven't yet had any direct response from him to President Zelensky saying that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=230.0s)]
*  he's ready to work towards a peace deal and that he will sign that minerals deal any time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=234.72s)]
*  So we wonder, could that time be just before Donald Trump's big congressional speech tonight? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=239.88s)]
*  He would love to announce that he had signed a deal and treat it as vindication of his [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=245.32s)]
*  aggressive, even bullying approach to international diplomacy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=250.4s)]
*  And we will have full coverage of Donald Trump's speech to Congress through the night with [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=254.72s)]
*  BBC News here on BBC One. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=259.44s)]
*  Thank you very much Sarah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=262.36s)]
*  Let's go now to James Waterhouse who's in Kiev for us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=264.04s)]
*  James, given President Zelensky's words today and this anticipation of a deal, is Ukraine [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=267.72s)]
*  bowing to the inevitable? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=272.68s)]
*  I think so Rita. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=276.92s)]
*  We are seeing Ukraine bend to Donald Trump's vision as for how this war should end. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=277.92s)]
*  It is a position driven by Ukraine's reliance on America. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=283.8s)]
*  This is a country that at the moment is manufacturing around a third of the weapons it needs to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  fight against Russia. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=292.84s)]
*  It hopes that'll go up to 50% by the end of the year but it's the quality and quantity [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=294.52s)]
*  of what America provides that it wants so badly. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=298.88s)]
*  The pausing of this military aid will affect Ukraine's ability to protect the skies in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=302.44s)]
*  cities like Kiev as well as to strike Russian targets deep behind enemy lines. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=307.16s)]
*  Now the signing of this mineral deal just might bring Russia, bring America back to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  Ukraine's aid in a military sense in the future. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  But it also might not. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  The presence of American companies in Ukraine didn't exactly stop the full scale invasion. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=325.48s)]
*  But the most concerning thing for Ukraine I think is what this means for Russia. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=330.68s)]
*  Of all the compromises Ukraine is being asked to make, Ukraine's ability to defend itself [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=337.12s)]
*  is being hampered and there is nothing new being announced by the White House that is [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=341.2s)]
*  slowing Russia's continued advances across a vast front line. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=345.0s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=350.28s)]
*  James Waterhouse reporting there from Kiev. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=351.64s)]
*  Well, as we heard, US tariffs on imports from its top three trading partners, Canada, Mexico [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  and China have come into force. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  Canada and China have already hit back with tit for tat levies. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=363.16s)]
*  Faisal Islam is here to tell us more. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=366.44s)]
*  Faisal. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  Thanks Rita. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  These are huge new tariffs aimed at the US biggest trade partners, Canada and Mexico. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  These are countries with whom the US chairs a free trade area. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  This action, 25% on almost all imports from both countries, effectively blows up that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  Mexico-Canada-America agreement negotiated by Donald Trump himself. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  China was hit today too with a 20% tariff on its exports to the US and the official [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=391.84s)]
*  reason, the legal basis, is the claim that all three countries are responsible for the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=397.08s)]
*  deadly fentanyl drug crisis in the US. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=402.96s)]
*  But President Trump keeps on mentioning other reasons, unfair trade or wanting to make Canada [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=406.56s)]
*  the 51st state of the US. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  Both China and Canada already hit back with equivalent tariffs. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=414.32s)]
*  Mexico will do so on Sunday. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  Today, the United States launched a trade war against Canada. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  Their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=427.32s)]
*  At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=437.76s)]
*  Now it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=441.64s)]
*  out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=448.92s)]
*  Now the US president shot back that he would hit back in turn against Canada, again refusing [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=457.12s)]
*  to refer to his neighbours as having a prime minister. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  He said, please explain to Governor Trudeau of Canada that when he puts on a retaliatory [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=466.36s)]
*  tariff on the US, our reciprocal tariff will immediately increase by a like amount. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=471.64s)]
*  President Trump may have been a little more worried by a considerable fall in US stock [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  markets over the last couple of days as traders finally had to take the president's trade [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=482.0s)]
*  threats, their impact on the economy and higher inflation very seriously. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=487.56s)]
*  The president tends to notice this sort of hit. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=491.84s)]
*  And this is just the start. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=495.08s)]
*  The whole world could be hit with tariffs on steel and aluminium, on cars, on agriculture [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=496.44s)]
*  and on countries that have VAT, all of which could come into force over the next month. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  The economic effect of this is well known. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=507.92s)]
*  Tariffs hit growth and raised prices for consumers. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=510.52s)]
*  Here's a rather clear example from Donald Trump's first term. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=513.84s)]
*  In 2018, he levied America first tariffs on washing machine imports of 20 to 50 percent. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=517.4s)]
*  By summer 2022, US washing machine prices were 42 percent higher, even dragging up the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiyCbwwlQ2Y&t=522.88s)]
