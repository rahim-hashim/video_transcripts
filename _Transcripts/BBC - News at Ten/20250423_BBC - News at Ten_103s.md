Video Description: Walmart and Target, two of the biggest retailers in the US, have privately warned President Trump that their customers may face empty shelves in the coming weeks if his tariff policies continue, according to the BBC’s US partner CBS News.  
There’s evidence that the prohibitive level of tariffs imposed between China and the US are having a major impact on trade volumes.  Ports on the US west coast, in particular Los Angeles, are reporting a collapse in China  to US cargos, down 33% in the past week and expected to be down as much as 44% in the first week of May.
Walmart and Target are among the biggest retailers in the United States providing goods for millions of customers.  Both companies had already warned that the tariffs trade war could lead to higher prices. 
The Trump administration has levied 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on most other countries.  It has also imposed 25% tariffs on vehicle imports to the US.  It’s led to sharp falls in stock markets around the world along with fears of surging inflation and a slowdown in economic growth.
President Trump has said his tariff policies with reinvigorate US manufacturing.  He’s seeking to negotiate new trade deals and reach agreement with China, predicting that the current level of tariffs will come down significantly.

**BBC - News at Ten:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo)
*  Lots of mentions of the word deal there, Faisal. What's your sense of whether one may be close? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi Jane, yeah we've had some significant developments really in the last hour or so that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=9.36s)]
*  may help to explain the conciliatory tone that I picked up and communicated in that report, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=13.44s)]
*  which is that the our partners CBS News are reporting that the the chief executives of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=19.44s)]
*  Walmart and Target have privately warned President Trump of empty shelves in the coming weeks [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=25.04s)]
*  if he continues with his tariff policies and that probably particularly concerns the prohibitive [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=31.68s)]
*  tariffs both ways on US-China trade. We're hearing from the ports on the west coast of America, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=37.84s)]
*  Los Angeles in particular, of a potential collapse in China to US cargos down 33% this week, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=45.36s)]
*  potentially 44% in the first week of May. This is a serious hit to the world economy and something [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=53.36s)]
*  that will be seen visibly in the US on shelves if you believe the CEOs of some of America's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=61.76s)]
*  biggest companies or at least the reporting of what they have said privately. This is highly [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  significant stuff, may explain as I say some of the reaches for deals. We think there might be [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=71.36s)]
*  a meeting between Scott Besson, who you saw in my report, the US Treasury Secretary and his Chinese [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=77.36s)]
*  counterpart. That meeting, if it happens, assumes incredible importance in bringing the world down [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=82.32s)]
*  from this trade war. We don't know if it happens, we don't know if the Chinese want to pick up the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=88.72s)]
*  phone and attend that, we don't know what the conditions will be, but incredibly important [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=93.28s)]
*  meetings happening here at the IMF in DC and not just involving the UK. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuxNufDldqo&t=98.32s)]
