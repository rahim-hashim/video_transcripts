Video Description: Iran has warned that an attack by the US would bring hell to the Middle East.   In an interview with the BBC the country’s deputy foreign minister Saeed Khatibzadeh warned President Trump against involvement in a war that was "not his war".
 
The White House said Donald Trump will decide in the next two weeks whether the US will become directly involved in the Iran-Israel conflict.   It said he still believed there is a "substantial chance of negotiations”.
Israel has attacked Iran’s nuclear sites and other targets leading to a state of war between the two countries.   Iran has responded by firing thousands of missiles at Israel.  
The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his war aim is to prevent Iran building a nuclear weapon. Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful and solely intended to produce nuclear energy.
Russia's President Putin has offered to mediate between the warring sides.  Russia is an ally of the Iranian regime.

# Iran warns US attack will bring “hell” to region as Trump says negotiation is possible | BBC News

*  of negotiations with Tehran over ending the conflict. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=11.68s)]
*  It came at the end of another day of missile exchanges between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=15.42s)]
*  Almost 300 people were injured in Israel today, including more than 70 when a hospital was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=19.52s)]
*  hit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Iran has warned the United States not to get involved in the conflict, saying it would [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  result in hell for the whole region. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=29.36s)]
*  Our North America editor, Sarah Smith, is in Washington. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=32.04s)]
*  After all the fevered speculation that Donald Trump could make a decision to strike Iran [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=38.44s)]
*  at any moment, he has lowered the temperature considerably today by saying that he will [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=43.08s)]
*  make a decision within the next two weeks. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=48.04s)]
*  There are no talks currently scheduled with Iran, not that we know of, but he clearly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=51.72s)]
*  wants one last chance to try to do a deal in which Iran would agree to stop all uranium [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=56.12s)]
*  enrichment in return for not being attacked by some of America's largest and most destructive [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  weapons. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=67.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's instinct is pretty much always to try and force other countries to bully [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=68.28s)]
*  them into doing what he wants without having to resort to military action. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  Deep inside the White House, in the subterranean Situation Room, there are daily meetings discussing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=80.16s)]
*  a possible U.S. strike on Iran. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Around the world, from Israel and Iran to the U.K. and the U.S., there is an intense [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=88.64s)]
*  focus on what decision President Trump will make. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=93.4s)]
*  I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, based on the fact that there [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=96.56s)]
*  is a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=101.64s)]
*  near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=106.48s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president for all of you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Trump says he will not make a final decision until the very last second. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=115.48s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=120.52s)]
*  I may do it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=121.52s)]
*  I may not do it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=122.52s)]
*  I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=123.52s)]
*  There are media reports that Mr. Trump has already approved a plan of attack but not [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  yet decided to implement it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=129.16s)]
*  He's pushed back on that, saying on social media, the Wall Street Journal has no idea [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=131.68s)]
*  what my thoughts are concerning Iran. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump has vowed retribution for this latest Iranian attack on a hospital in Beersheba. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=140.76s)]
*  The prime minister is urging Donald Trump to join the battle. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=145.84s)]
*  President Trump will do what's best for America. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=149.76s)]
*  I trust his judgment. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=152.0s)]
*  He's a tremendous friend, a tremendous world leader, a tremendous friend of Israel and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=153.84s)]
*  the Jewish people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=157.44s)]
*  And we will do what we have to do, and we are doing it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=159.2s)]
*  We are committed to destroying the nuclear threat, the threat of a nuclear annihilation [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=162.0s)]
*  against Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  We're able to do it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=169.72s)]
*  And we, of course, will make our own determination. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=171.64s)]
*  But I have to say that the partnership with the United States, the partnership with President [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=174.56s)]
*  Trump, with whom I speak to almost every day, is incredible. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=178.64s)]
*  No one in Iran is speaking directly with President Trump, not that we know of. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=183.36s)]
*  But he's still holding out hope that the regime may agree to give up their nuclear [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=187.32s)]
*  program without American military action. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=191.48s)]
*  Their public statements, though, are defiant. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=194.72s)]
*  We think that this war is not American war. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=196.84s)]
*  But if they would like to get into this war, President Trump will be remembered forever [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=199.24s)]
*  for a war that was not his war, but dragged in. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=204.08s)]
*  And this will be a quackmire, and this will be a hell for the whole region. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=207.52s)]
*  The likely focus of an American attack is the deeply buried nuclear site of Fordow, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  south of Tehran. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  Getting to this facility is near impossible with existing weapons in Israel's current [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=218.68s)]
*  arsenal. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  It's deep inside the mountain. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=223.96s)]
*  If the US attacks, they would have to use the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=226.78s)]
*  It is the only aircraft capable of effectively deploying the GBU-57, the massive ordnance [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=231.94s)]
*  penetrator that weighs in at 30,000 pounds. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=237.38s)]
*  The biggest risk would be to US forces stationed in the region. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=241.38s)]
*  If an Iranian reprisal were to kill an American, a wider conflict could quickly ensue, one [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=244.94s)]
*  with global consequences. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=250.06s)]
*  The principle is that we need to de-escalate this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=251.9s)]
*  There's a real risk of escalation here that will impact the region, possibly beyond the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=254.38s)]
*  region, into Gaza. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=260.02s)]
*  And obviously it's already having an impact on the economy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=261.58s)]
*  So I've been absolutely clear we need to de-escalate this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=264.7s)]
*  By giving himself two weeks to reach a decision, President Trump has created some breathing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=269.82s)]
*  room, a little time to give diplomacy a chance. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=274.14s)]
*  He's hoping that the threat of US airstrikes might be enough to force Iran to comply with [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=277.58s)]
*  his demands and prevent America getting dragged into the kind of foreign war he pledged to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=282.26s)]
*  avoid. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=287.26s)]
*  Sarah Smith, BBC News, Washington. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=288.26s)]
*  Let's talk to our correspondent, Ioni Wells, who is in Jerusalem. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=291.26s)]
*  All quiet so far tonight over Israel, but what happens now? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=295.3s)]
*  Do they give diplomacy a chance? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=299.62s)]
*  Do these missile attacks stop? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=301.3s)]
*  Well I think the short answer is no. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=305.62s)]
*  And there's a couple of factors that I think contribute to that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  Firstly we have to look at why Israel struck Iran in the first place and their justification [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=311.1s)]
*  for that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=316.42s)]
*  They said that Iran's nuclear programme was days away from potentially producing a nuclear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=317.42s)]
*  bomb, something that Iran denies, and that this was an existential threat to Israel. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  They came up with a long list of targets that they wanted to eliminate, including Iran's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=327.5s)]
*  entire nuclear programme, but also its ballistic missile threat. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  Now it would seem odd for the Israeli government to suddenly decide to stop this targeting, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=335.06s)]
*  which is clearly stated, is its aim. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=340.62s)]
*  Now secondly, Israel, and especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has long been [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=342.74s)]
*  sceptical of Iran's diplomacy. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=347.54s)]
*  It is one of the reasons that people think that they may have decided to strike Iran [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=350.02s)]
*  before what was supposed to be the latest round of US-Iran negotiations over Iran's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  nuclear programme. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=360.3s)]
*  So that is another factor I think that suggests this isn't going to go away. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=362.1s)]
*  Now thirdly, you have to look at what the rhetoric has been from both Israel's government [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=366.14s)]
*  but also President Donald Trump. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=371.02s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu said just this evening that he wasn't looking for a green light [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=373.06s)]
*  from the US before those initial strikes on Iran, and Donald Trump has said as well that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=376.78s)]
*  he's told Netanyahu to carry on. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=382.62s)]
*  I don't think any of that looks anything like the kind of de-escalation that we've heard [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=385.3s)]
*  other world leaders calling for. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=389.86s)]
*  Irony Wells, thank you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=391.62s)]
*  Well our political editor Chris Mason is with me now. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=393.1s)]
*  De-escalation, that's what Sir Keir Starmer has been calling for. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=396.5s)]
*  David Lammy is in Washington, he's been there today. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=399.62s)]
*  Is there any sign that they've been listening? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=403.3s)]
*  Donald Trump been listening to Sir Keir Starmer? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  Well certainly from those I speak to in government, they see this two-week window as welcome because [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=407.3s)]
*  it's not at least immediately the alternative, which is an escalation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  The Prime Minister's watchword, as you say, has been the opposite, de-escalation. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  So David Lammy, as you say, has been in Washington, he met Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=420.66s)]
*  he also met Steve Wittkopf, the US Special Envoy to the Middle East. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=424.38000000000005s)]
*  And I detect coming out of that a sense in Washington that emphatically they would prefer [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=428.62s)]
*  a diplomatic solution, but they're quite pessimistic about the likelihood of getting to that and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  that the military action remains on the table. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=439.34000000000003s)]
*  The Foreign Secretary is now flying to Geneva in Switzerland, there's talks there with Iran's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=442.5s)]
*  Foreign Minister alongside Germany and France. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=447.3s)]
*  And then back here at Westminster there are historical parallels, they're imperfect but [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  they're nonetheless being made including from figures in government with Iraq of two decades ago. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=455.3s)]
*  A Middle Eastern country, talk of development of nuclear weapons, threatened US aggression [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=461.14000000000004s)]
*  and a big question, what should the UK do? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=468.22s)]
*  And in particular in this instance the military base of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=470.66s)]
*  a potential starting point for those US bombers heading to Iran if they press ahead with these strikes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=475.82s)]
*  Now the Liberal Democrats today have explicitly been drawing that parallel with 20 years ago, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=483.14s)]
*  saying the legal advice should be published. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=487.34s)]
*  The Conservatives are saying the UK should be much more bold in being willing to support [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=489.58s)]
*  an ally in Israel. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=492.53999999999996s)]
*  So for now the talking continues, but at some point the Prime Minister's phone could ring [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  and it could be Donald Trump saying, are you with us or not? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=499.46s)]
*  And that is a big decision. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=502.65999999999997s)]
*  Charismasome, thank you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  Well one unlikely mediator in all this, at least that's what he has offered to do, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=507.94s)]
*  is Russia's President Putin. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=512.42s)]
*  Russia has a strategic partnership with Iran and he is urging the United States not to intervene. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=514.26s)]
*  Our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=519.9s)]
*  It's an economic forum. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=526.94s)]
*  But in St Petersburg this week, Vladimir Putin isn't just talking business. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=529.1800000000001s)]
*  He's thinking geopolitics because of the dramatic events in the Middle East. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=534.18s)]
*  Here, the Kremlin leader's first public reaction to the escalating violence. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=542.78s)]
*  An offer to mediate. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=547.98s)]
*  Russia, he says, has sent signals to Israel, Iran and America. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=549.78s)]
*  From Russian diplomats, condemnation of Israeli attacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  Everybody is talking about political situation, regime change, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=562.34s)]
*  but nobody is focused on the most important and dangerous thing, nuclear issue. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=567.74s)]
*  Russia and Iran are close allies. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=576.58s)]
*  Earlier this year they signed a strategic partnership agreement. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=579.1s)]
*  But the deal doesn't oblige Moscow to come to Tehran's defence. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=582.98s)]
*  And it hasn't stopped the Kremlin maintaining good relations too with Israel. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=587.66s)]
*  Russia has obvious good ways to talk to different parties of the conflict. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=592.58s)]
*  But once again, let's see how the situation develops. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=600.02s)]
*  I think all of us want stability in the Middle East. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=603.42s)]
*  All of us want some kind of resolution. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=606.62s)]
*  No sign of America, though, accepting Russia's offer to mediate. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=610.82s)]
*  Some here actually see positives for Russia from escalation in the Middle East. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=615.54s)]
*  They predict that higher global oil prices will boost the economy [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=620.38s)]
*  and that the world's attention will be diverted away from Russia's war in Ukraine. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=623.9799999999999s)]
*  But the idea of direct US military intervention in Iran [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=629.42s)]
*  and the prospect of regime change there, that is causing alarm in the Kremlin. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=632.9799999999999s)]
*  While calling for de-escalation in the Middle East, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=639.18s)]
*  Russia continues to wage war on its neighbour, on Ukraine. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=642.58s)]
*  We never bomb civilians. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=647.34s)]
*  We just target military targets, objects and infrastructure in Ukraine. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=649.9s)]
*  There was a mass Russian attack on Kiev a couple of days ago. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=658.66s)]
*  Drones and missiles and civilians were killed. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=662.7s)]
*  Russia wants to portray itself as peacemaker. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=666.66s)]
*  That's a hard sell. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHNWTK9GUg&t=670.78s)]
