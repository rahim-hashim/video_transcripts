Video Description: Donald Trump has accused Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky of being “a dictator without elections” in a further deterioration in relations between the two leaders.   
President Trump’s comments on social media followed a false claim that Ukraine had started the war with Russia, along with demands for the country to give the US rights to half its valuable mineral resources.
In response President Zelensky accused Donald Trump of living in a Russian-made “disinformation space” and called on Mr Trump’s team “to be more truthful”. 
The "dictator" attack from Donald Trump led to criticism from European leaders.  The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said "it is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelensky his democratic legitimacy".   The British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also gave his backing in a phone call to the Ukrainian president in which he "expressed his support for Volodymr Zelensky as Ukraine's democratically elected leader".

# Trump calls Zelensky a “dictator” -  Ukraine says Trump is spreading Russian propaganda | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0)
*  Remember, this is a war launched by Vladimir Putin that has killed tens of thousands of soldiers, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=0.0s)]
*  well over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians and created more than 10 million refugees, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=6.24s)]
*  as well as shattering Ukraine's economy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=12.0s)]
*  James Waterhouse has more from Kiev after a tense 48 hours between Washington and Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=14.88s)]
*  An extraordinary allegation from Ukraine's once biggest ally. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=22.64s)]
*  I think I have the power to end this war and I think it's going very well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=26.8s)]
*  But today I heard, oh well we weren't invited. Well you've been there for three years, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=31.28s)]
*  you should have ended it three years, you should have never started it, you could have made a deal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=34.56s)]
*  Leading to an unprecedented response from President Zelensky, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=39.44s)]
*  who accused Donald Trump of living in a bubble. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=42.88s)]
*  It is unfortunate that President Trump, and with great respect for him as the leader of the American [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=47.84s)]
*  people who constantly support us, unfortunately lives in this disinformation space. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=52.64s)]
*  On his truth social platform, Trump doubled down. He refuses to have elections, he said. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=58.56s)]
*  He's very low in Ukrainian polls. He then described Ukraine's leader as a dictator without [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=64.08s)]
*  elections. Zelensky better move fast, he added, or he's not going to have a country left. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=69.44s)]
*  What President Zelensky is not is a dictator. Elections have legally been postponed here since [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=74.8s)]
*  the start of the invasion, so perhaps not a good day for America's envoy to Ukraine, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=80.16s)]
*  Kyiv Kellogg, to visit. Washington claims it is successfully negotiating an end to the war with [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  Russia, where Vladimir Putin is enjoying a rekindling of relations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  It is impossible to solve many issues, including the Ukrainian crisis, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  without increasing the level of trust between Russia and the United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=104.08s)]
*  Away from the politics, Ukraine's capital is just trying to get on. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  Russian tanks were expected to be in Kyiv within days on that morning three years ago, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=113.28s)]
*  and the fact that they were stopped is something people are very proud of. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=118.08s)]
*  But America's new foreign policy and how Russia reacts to it means Ukraine could still lose this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=122.32s)]
*  war. Like any city, you just need to scratch beneath the surface. Almost everyone knows [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=128.16s)]
*  someone who's been injured or killed. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=133.12s)]
*  If Trump doesn't want to be with us, if he doesn't want to support Ukraine, then essentially he's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=135.84s)]
*  betraying his voters, betraying America and its ideals, the very ideals we are defending here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=142.08s)]
*  For Ukraine, everything will be all right. Our guys are not fighting in vain there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=151.2s)]
*  We're optimistic and hopeful. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=156.88s)]
*  We will definitely win, but I don't think we will feel joy from that, because my brother [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=158.96s)]
*  and my cousin were killed, and it's the same for nearly every family. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=165.12s)]
*  A reminder of the sacrifice Ukraine has made to withstand Russia's aggression. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=171.36s)]
*  The last 24 hours has put it at risk of being for nothing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=176.08s)]
*  James Waterhouse, BBC News, Kyiv. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=181.44s)]
*  Part of the dispute between President Trump and President Zelensky centres on Ukraine's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=189.44s)]
*  mineral reserves. Mr Trump wants access in payment for America's past support in the war with Russia. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=194.24s)]
*  But Mr Zelensky says he's asking for too much. James Landell is here with that story. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  Clive, Donald Trump may want peace in Ukraine, but he also wants a peace of Ukraine, namely some of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=206.8s)]
*  its valuable mineral resources. President Zelensky is resisting, and that, it seems, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=214.08s)]
*  has provoked President Trump's fury. As you can see from this map, from Ukraine's geological survey, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=219.28s)]
*  the country is rich in raw materials as well as oil and gas. Some estimates suggest its underground [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=226.4s)]
*  deposits are worth more than $11 trillion. This includes critical minerals such as graphite, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=232.08s)]
*  lithium, titanium and zirconium, and what are called rare earth materials. These 17 [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=238.48s)]
*  metallic elements are used in everything from mobile phones to electric vehicles to missiles [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=245.28s)]
*  and superconductors. Now, Ukraine says it has about 5% of the world's mineral resources. For [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=250.32s)]
*  example, it says it produces 7% of the world's titanium, and it has 22 out of the 34 minerals [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=256.96s)]
*  that the EU has identified as critical. Now, last year, as part of his peace plan, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=265.12s)]
*  President Zelensky suggested American firms could get access to some of these rare earth deposits [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=270.8s)]
*  in return for continued US military support. But Mr Trump's team have demanded as much as 50% [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=276.88s)]
*  of Ukraine's mineral wealth and energy reserves. Mr Trump claims, inaccurately, that Ukraine owes [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=284.0s)]
*  America £400 billion for its previous military support. Mr Zelensky says this is not a serious [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=290.56s)]
*  conversation. I am defending Ukraine. I cannot sell our country. That is all. I say, OK, let's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=298.4s)]
*  have something positive. You will write down some guarantees, and we will write a memorandum with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=309.2s)]
*  some percentages. I was told only 50%. I said, OK, no. And despite all this diplomatic to and fro, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=313.92s)]
*  industry experts say it might be hard to get these minerals out of the earth. And not all of those [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=322.88s)]
*  resources that have been identified by existing exploration and mapping during that Soviet era [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=329.6s)]
*  will be economic to extract. Some of those will not be and will never come into production. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=337.44s)]
*  So for those reasons, the estimates that have been put out there are very much estimates. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=344.08s)]
*  There needs to be a lot more work to prove those mineral deposits into economic reserves. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=351.52s)]
*  What is clear, though, is that Donald Trump wants any cessation of hostilities in this war [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=359.36s)]
*  to provide economic benefits to the United States, either by extorting minerals from [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=364.64s)]
*  Ukraine or securing access to markets in Russia. But right now, Volodymyr Zelensky is not playing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=369.36s)]
*  ball. Clive. All right. James, thank you. James Landelaar, diplomatic correspondent there. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=376.56s)]
*  Well, let's get a final word from Jeremy, who's live in Kiev. Jeremy, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=382.0s)]
*  how would you characterise US-Ukraine relations tonight? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=386.24s)]
*  In pieces. Broken. I think the statements that Trump made were absolutely laden with falsehoods. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=390.0s)]
*  You can call them exaggerations, you can call them outright lies. Take your pick. He sounds [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=401.52s)]
*  as if he's changed sides, effectively. I think that's how it's being seen here. And those people [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=407.12s)]
*  who interpret Trump, and it is hard to get inside his head, say, look, do not take all of this stuff [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=412.4s)]
*  literally. He's a disruptor. He throws people off their well-established positions so they will then [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=417.28s)]
*  be flexible enough to make a deal. But you know what? He is the president of the United States, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=426.55999999999995s)]
*  the most powerful man in the world. You have to listen to what he says. And he's been very clear [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  about his views at the moment. So it's been a week since he made that call to President Putin. And [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  since then, relations with Ukraine have been, well, they've been fractured. The relationship [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=444.0s)]
*  since 1945 across the Atlantic with Europe has been badly damaged. And I think it's appropriate [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=451.28s)]
*  at this point to say, with Trump in this mood, you have to look at the North Atlantic Treaty that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=458.96s)]
*  underpins NATO. And the key part of it, Article 5, the all for one, one for all, one country's attacked, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=464.56s)]
*  everybody else piles in to help them out. Would Donald Trump, with these kind of attitudes, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=471.92s)]
*  honor those commitments to America? He hasn't said that he won't, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=479.12s)]
*  but I think right now it's a question that plenty of people are asking. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQZJvuEHFq0&t=483.52000000000004s)]
