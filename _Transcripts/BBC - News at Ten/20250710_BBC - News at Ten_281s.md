Video Description: At least 15 Palestinians, including 10 children, have been killed in an Israeli strike while queuing for nutritional supplements outside a medical clinic in central Gaza.
US-based aid group Project Hope, which runs the clinic, said the attack was a blatant violation of international law. The Israeli military said it struck a "Hamas terrorist" and regretted any harm to civilians.   The victims were among 66 people reportedly killed in Israeli strikes on the same day.
Project Hope said the attack in front of its Altayara health clinic in Deir al-Balah happened as patients gathered outside, waiting to receive treatment for malnutrition, infections and chronic illnesses.
Graphic footage posted on social media, which was verified by the BBC, showed the immediate aftermath of the attack, with adults and young children lying in a street, some severely wounded and others not moving.
At the mortuary of nearby al-Aqsa hospital, relatives of those killed wept as they wrapped the dead children in white shrouds and body bags before performing funeral prayers.  One woman told the BBC that her pregnant niece Manal, and her daughter Fatima had been killed.
Project Hope's president and CEO, Rabih Torbay, said the aid group's clinics were "a place of refuge in Gaza where people bring their small children, women access pregnancy and postpartum care, people receive treatment for malnutrition, and more".
"Yet, this morning, innocent families were mercilessly attacked as they stood in line waiting for the doors to open," he added. "Horrified and heartbroken cannot properly communicate how we feel anymore."
"This is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, and a stark reminder that no-one and no place is safe in Gaza, even as ceasefire talks continue. This cannot continue."
Unicef boss Catherine Russell said: "The killing of families trying to access life-saving aid is unconscionable."
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that it struck a member of the elite Nukhba forces of Hamas's military wing who had taken part in the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.
The airstrike took place as Israelâ€™s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu left Washington after talks with President Trump without reaching agreement on a new ceasefire plan in Gaza.

# At least 10 children killed by Israeli airstrike while queuing at Gaza medical centre | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto)
*  Women and children queuing for nutritional supplements [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=0.0s)]
*  are among those killed in Israel's latest strikes on Gaza. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=2.88s)]
*  Some of the victims waiting outside the clinic [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=6.88s)]
*  were there for food paste given to children [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=9.08s)]
*  with severe malnutrition. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=11.44s)]
*  The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas terrorist [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=13.32s)]
*  and that the incident was under review. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=16.64s)]
*  The Israeli government doesn't allow international journalists [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  independent access in Gaza, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=22.16s)]
*  so Nick Beek sent this report from Jerusalem [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=24.32s)]
*  and there are distressing scenes from the start. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  Smoke and screams filled the street [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  where they'd just been giving out food [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=36.08s)]
*  for malnourished children. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=38.04s)]
*  Please get my daughter an ambulance, a woman calls out. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=41.68s)]
*  For many, it was too late for help. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=47.12s)]
*  The moment of realisation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=52.12s)]
*  Firas's sister and mother were both killed in the Israeli strike. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=58.24s)]
*  Why did they target a place where people want to get food [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=65.64s)]
*  for their children? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Food for their children! [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=70.16s)]
*  Their children were hungry. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=72.2s)]
*  Doctors tried to save young lives, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=74.84s)]
*  but at least 10 children were killed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  The Israeli military said it targeted a Hamas terrorist [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=79.68s)]
*  and that it regretted any harm to the children. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=83.64s)]
*  To whom it called uninvolved individuals. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  Israel's army has been carrying out controlled explosions too. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=91.44s)]
*  This is the city of Rafa, where the defence minister [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=95.36s)]
*  has now ordered plans for a camp to be built, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=98.32s)]
*  which would hold all two million people living in Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=101.08s)]
*  We have to stop it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=104.8s)]
*  Yotam Vilk fought in Gaza for the first year of the war, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=106.0s)]
*  but then refused to serve, saying there was no end in sight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  He condemned this proposal for a mass camp. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=113.84s)]
*  So any form of transfer of a civil population [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=116.56s)]
*  is a form of war crime, that's a form of ethnic cleansing, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=120.52s)]
*  which is also a form of genocide. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=123.8s)]
*  The Israeli government just really does not care about our lives [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  as you don't care about Palestinians' lives. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=129.0s)]
*  The charge of genocide is rejected by Israel's prime minister. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=131.44s)]
*  He said a truce in Gaza was getting nearer. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=135.24s)]
*  We are talking about a 60-day ceasefire [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=138.32s)]
*  in which half the live hostages [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=141.12s)]
*  and half of the deceased hostages would be returned to Israel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  by these Hamas monsters, you know. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  And yes, I think we're getting closer to a deal. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=153.55999999999997s)]
*  It can't come soon enough for the hostage families [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  and the people of Gaza, where on average this month, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  more than 100 Palestinians are reported to have been killed every day. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  Nick Beek, BBC News, Jerusalem. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, as Nick explained, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=174.64s)]
*  has been in Washington this week, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=178.6s)]
*  as President Trump pushes for a breakthrough for a truce in Gaza. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=180.44s)]
*  But Mr Netanyahu is leaving tonight without any major announcement. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  Tom Bateman is at the White House for us. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=188.6s)]
*  Has anything been achieved, Tom? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=191.27999999999997s)]
*  No, and I think there is a clear sense of frustration, Rita, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=196.32s)]
*  emerging from the White House tonight. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  Mr Netanyahu leaves after four days, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=202.32s)]
*  but without Mr Trump being able to announce the deal that he had wanted, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  his envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  had said that he was going to fly to Doha, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=211.88s)]
*  where there's indirect talks between Israel and Hamas [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=214.2s)]
*  have been going on, basically to finalise the last pieces of this puzzle. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=216.56s)]
*  But it's not even clear that that trip is now happening, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=221.44s)]
*  or if so, exactly when it will take place. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=224.6s)]
*  In terms of the issues, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  Hamas basically wants a guarantee backed by the White House [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=229.6s)]
*  that Israel wouldn't use the 60-day truce to get hostages out, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=233.32s)]
*  but then to return to the war. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, clearly, they don't feel they have got that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=240.88s)]
*  Mr Netanyahu, I think under pressure from President Trump [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=243.32s)]
*  to try and advance things, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=246.04s)]
*  has said that he's prepared for a permanent end to the war, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=247.56s)]
*  but the condition is that he says Hamas must disarm [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  and Gaza be demilitarised. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=253.92s)]
*  Now, that may well be a condition [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=255.92s)]
*  that he knows the group will not agree to. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=257.92s)]
*  And so the talks, I think, variously described tonight [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=259.96s)]
*  as at a stalemate certainly stalled. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=262.56s)]
*  And so you have Mr Trump having said last week [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=265.56s)]
*  that he thought basically there would be a deal this week [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=268.76s)]
*  as we end these few days with Mr Netanyahu leaving [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=272.12s)]
*  and no signs of an imminent breakthrough. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r7ynyTMgto&t=275.56s)]
