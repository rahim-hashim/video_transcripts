Video Description: Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has rejected an immediate and full ceasefire in Ukraine, agreeing only to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, during a phone call negotiation with US President Donald Trump.
The Russian leader declined to sign up to the comprehensive month-long ceasefire that Trump's team recently agreed with Ukrainian negotiations during talks in Saudi Arabia.
Putin again set conditions which have already been rejected by Ukraine and its European allies.  He said a comprehensive ceasefire can only take place if there is Ukraine’s allies stop all military aid and intelligence sharing.  The Russian President also said that Ukraine must end all military mobilisation.  
The US and Russian leaders did agree that further peace talks would take place  in the Middle East.   
Trump posted on social media that the phone call with the Russian leader was "very good and productive.... we agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine."
However the outcome of the phone call amounts to a disappointing lack of progress for the Trump administration on its plan to end the war.

# Trump-Putin call: Russian leader rejects plan for immediate Ukraine ceasefire | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg)
*  Donald Trump's heavily trailed phone call with Vladimir Putin hasn't led to Moscow signing up to a 30-day ceasefire in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia's ongoing war with its neighbor. In fact, the 90-minute conversation [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=7.4s)]
*  seems to have given the Kremlin more of an opportunity to make conditions on any truce, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=11.96s)]
*  including the requirement that Kiev must stop receiving foreign military aid and intelligence and end military mobilization. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=17.32s)]
*  Mr. Putin did say, however, he was willing to pause attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=25.66s)]
*  but 80% of it has already been destroyed by Russian bombs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=31.6s)]
*  This evening, President Zelensky said it's clear Russia isn't ready to end this war. The whole game is to weaken Ukraine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=36.06s)]
*  We'll be live in Kiev, but first Sarah Smith has our top story from Washington. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=43.66s)]
*  Ukrainian forces carried on training to take on their Russian invaders today. A permanent peace deal still seems a long way off. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=49.1s)]
*  A good and productive conversation, said Mr. Trump. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=59.42s)]
*  Disappointing or underwhelming might be more accurate as he failed to negotiate a full 30-day halt in the fighting. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=63.28s)]
*  He posted on social media, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=69.86s)]
*  We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=71.58000000000001s)]
*  with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire and ultimately an end to this very horrible war between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=75.30000000000001s)]
*  Attacks on Ukrainian power plants, this one was bombed in November, caused frequent power cuts across the country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=85.38000000000001s)]
*  A 30-day reprieve will be welcome on both sides. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=92.02000000000001s)]
*  Ukrainians also struck oil and gas facilities inside Russia. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=94.98s)]
*  Vladimir Putin did look particularly satisfied just after the phone call, as he met one of his advisors on Ukraine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=97.94s)]
*  Before he'll discuss ending the conflict, he insists all foreign military aid to Ukraine must be cut off. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  Air raid sirens sounded in Kiev after those ceasefire talks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=113.78s)]
*  The very limited truce, and Ukrainians could still come under Russian attack. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=117.66s)]
*  Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was visiting Finland today. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=121.7s)]
*  He says he wants to know exactly what Russia has promised and how they will be made to stick to it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=125.1s)]
*  We support all steps aimed at ending the war. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=133.22s)]
*  But to do this, we need to understand what exactly we support. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=136.34s)]
*  President Trump is a busy man. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=140.1s)]
*  When he has time, he can call me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=142.1s)]
*  He's got my number. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=144.1s)]
*  We are ready to talk through further steps with pleasure. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=146.1s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to move on quickly to agree a final settlement. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=151.66s)]
*  But he may have been too optimistic about how close he is to reaching a peace deal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=155.18s)]
*  Talks will now focus on the demands Russia once met before a complete ceasefire, let alone a final end to the conflict. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=159.18s)]
*  Here at the White House, there was remarkably high confidence yesterday that a peace deal was within reach. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=170.18s)]
*  But now they're looking at another round of negotiations just a few days from now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=176.18s)]
*  They're looking at another round of negotiations just to try to get the Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a complete ceasefire. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  And he's making those stringent demands that all foreign military assistance to Ukraine has to be stopped. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  All intelligence sharing with Kiev has to be stopped before he will talk about putting a final end to the conflict. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  Probably remember, Donald Trump used to say that he could end this war within 24 hours. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  It's obviously proving to be considerably more complex than he anticipated. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  All right, Sarah, thank you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=205.22s)]
*  Sarah Smith there, a North America editor live at the White House. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=207.22s)]
*  Let's go straight to Kiev and James Landale, who's in the Ukrainian capital. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=211.22s)]
*  I'm sure folks where you are, James, are happy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=215.22s)]
*  Their energy infrastructure or what's left of it might escape attack for a while. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=218.22s)]
*  But there's still no commitment from Moscow to a full ceasefire that Kiev has already signed up to. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=222.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's why Kiev's response, I think, has been pretty calibrated and cautious. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=228.74s)]
*  President Zelensky has welcomed the idea, at least the promise of an end to Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=234.74s)]
*  He said that even a partial ceasefire is a positive result. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=241.74s)]
*  But I have to say, Clive, this evening, there's not much evidence of any ceasefire. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=244.74s)]
*  Not only have we been hearing the air defences and drones in the skies above Kiev, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=249.74s)]
*  President Zelensky has in the last few moments just issued a statement in which he has said there have been numerous drone attacks across the country, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  not just in this region, but also in the Sumi region and other parts of the country, some of them hitting hospitals and other civilian areas. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=264.26s)]
*  So there is clearly tonight no evidence of an immediate ceasefire by Russian attacks in the air. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=273.26s)]
*  And I think that's why we've had from the Ukrainians a calibrated response. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=280.78s)]
*  They want to support what progress that the Americans have made. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=284.78s)]
*  They don't want to anger President Trump again. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=288.78s)]
*  But at the same time, President Zelensky said he made it very clear tonight that he says that what's been agreed today shows that Russia is still not ready to agree a peace deal here in this country. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=291.28s)]
*  And just as you've said that, more air defences going off behind me. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=304.28s)]
*  Clive. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=308.29999999999995s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=309.29999999999995s)]
*  The war continues. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  James, thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=310.29999999999995s)]
*  James Landell there live in Kiev. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHEcwXHyVg&t=310.79999999999995s)]
