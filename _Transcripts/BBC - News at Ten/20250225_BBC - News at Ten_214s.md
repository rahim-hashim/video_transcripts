Video Description: BREAKING: President Trump has confirmed that Ukraine and the United States have agreed the terms of “a major minerals deal”.  Trump said that Ukraine’s President Zelensky will sign the agreement with him at the White House on Friday.   He said: “It’s a very big deal, it could be a trillion dollar deal”.   He said the American people would be very happy with the agreement.
So far there are few details of the agreement.  It’s not clear whether the US will offer Ukraine any security guarantees in return, something that has been a key Ukrainian demand. 
Ukraine is rich in oil and gas along with many rare minerals.  President Trump had initially demanded a right to $500 billion in revenue from Ukraine’s minerals, in return for what he claimed were the costs to the US of supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia.  
That demand was rejected by President Zelensky, contributing to a war of words with Mr Trump in recent days, with the US president describing  the Ukrainian leader as a “dictator”.    Zelensky said nowhere near that much American aid had been provided, and said: "I can't sell our state."

**BBC - News at Ten:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc)
*  In the last hour, Ukrainian officials have said a deal has been reached between Kiev and Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=0.0s)]
*  on the joint exploitation of Ukraine's mineral resources. Now the country is rich in oil and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=5.12s)]
*  gas as well as raw materials as this map shows. Full details haven't yet been made public of the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=10.8s)]
*  deal but an agreement could be signed later this week and have consequences for the war with Russia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=16.4s)]
*  Donald Trump says President Zelensky might travel to the White House this Friday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Well in a moment we'll speak to James Waterhouse live in Kiev but first to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Gary O'Donoghue who's in Washington. Gary, has Donald Trump got what he wanted then? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Well we were told yesterday by the President that this deal was close and that turned out to be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=38.0s)]
*  true. It seems that the the i's have been dotted and the t's have been crossed. We don't know [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  much about the detail. President Trump has said already that this could be worth billions of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=47.36s)]
*  dollars to the US and an important part of his request and he said just in the last few minutes [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=52.72s)]
*  Clive that he expected the deal to be signed later this week. I hear that he's coming on Friday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=58.0s)]
*  Certainly it's okay with me if he'd like to and he would like to sign it together with me and I [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=64.72s)]
*  understand that's a big deal, very big deal and I think the American people even if you look at [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=69.28s)]
*  polling they're very happy because you know Biden was throwing money around like it's cotton candy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  and it's a very big deal. It could be a trillion dollar deal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=81.27999999999999s)]
*  Now we don't know exactly what President Trump has given in terms of security guarantees which [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=90.08s)]
*  is a key part of Ukraine's ask and we don't know how much of a share of those resources going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  forward that the Americans will have either and of course none of this can happen until the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=99.52s)]
*  fighting is finished. All right Gary O'Donoghue live at the White House there. To you James in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=104.16s)]
*  Kiev as Gary mentioned there one of the key stipulations for Kiev was some kind of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=109.52s)]
*  security guarantee as part of this deal. Do you have any idea if that's part of the agreement? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=116.56s)]
*  Clive I'm afraid I can't add to Gary's report there. We don't know any more details here [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=124.64s)]
*  on just what security guarantees Ukraine has secured from this apparent agreement. Now you're [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=130.96s)]
*  right this is what Ukraine has wanted. It has wanted America to be interested in its vast natural [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=137.76s)]
*  mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees so boots on the ground, ammunition, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=144.0s)]
*  weaponry, financial support to prevent Russia from invading again after a ceasefire is signed, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=149.28s)]
*  after Russia keeps hold of the fifth of Ukraine it has taken so far. We are told by sources here [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=156.0s)]
*  that the terms of this deal are much more favorable so you'll remember that Donald Trump said he wants [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=162.72s)]
*  access to 500 billion dollars worth of Ukrainian minerals a figure that's been disputed in these [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=168.24s)]
*  parts. That has now been dropped and we must remind ourselves of the hostile backdrop [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=174.32s)]
*  where Donald Trump has accused President Zelensky of being responsible for Russia's invasion, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=179.92s)]
*  falsely labeling him as a dictator. It's been incredibly hostile and now we have this apparent [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=185.92s)]
*  area of agreement and the hope here is this if America has agreed to this deal then it gives it [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=191.52s)]
*  a stake and if it has interests to defend then that might equate to military support to enable [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=198.96s)]
*  to Ukraine to exist after a ceasefire is signed. Indeed all right James good to see you James [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=205.44s)]
*  Waterhouse there live in Kyiv many thanks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9o6poGn3Rc&t=211.52s)]
