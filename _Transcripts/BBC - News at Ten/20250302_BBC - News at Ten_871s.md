Video Description: The British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and to defend it from Russia.
The UK, France and other countries will step up their support for Ukraine in what Mr Starmer called "a coalition of the willing" among European nations. 
The British Prime Minister was speaking at the end of a summit of 18 mainly European leaders in London including Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.  Mr Starmer said: “We are at a crossroads in history today."
The summit came two days after angry exchanges between the Ukrainian leader and US Donald Trump at the White House, in which Mr Trump urged President Zelensky to enter a peace deal with Russia but declined to commit US forces to provide a security guarantee. 
Mr Starmer said four key points had been agreed at the London summit:  
- to keep military aid flowing into Ukraine, and to keep increasing the economic pressure on Russia.  
- That any lasting peace must ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and security and Ukraine must be present at any peace talks. 
- In the event of a peace deal, to boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities to deter any future invasion
- To develop a "coalition of the willing" to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee peace afterwards
Sir Keir said: "We have to learn from the mistakes of the past, we cannot accept a weak deal... which Russia can breach with ease, instead any deal must be backed by strength”.   He did not state which countries had agreed to join this coalition but said its members would intensify planning now, with real urgency.

**BBC - News at Ten:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA)
*  There was much riding on this summit of European leaders in London how best to forge a path to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=0.0s)]
*  peace in the war with Russia after the meltdown of relations between Ukraine and the US. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=5.12s)]

*  with America but security guarantees are still necessary. Sakir Starmer hosting the summit said [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=15.84s)]
*  any peace deal must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and at the heart of any agreement must be the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=21.52s)]
*  United States. After the meeting President Zelensky flew to Sandringham to meet the king with the two [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=27.04s)]
*  men spending just under an hour together. Well what do Russians think of all this? We'll be live in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=33.2s)]
*  Moscow but first Chris Mason has our top story. Early spring sunshine in central London a few [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=38.32s)]
*  hundred yards from Buckingham Palace this mansion on the mall Lancaster house. This is what the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  leaders here wanted today to be about securing our future. The hour is Europe and Canada and the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=53.44s)]
*  host Sakir Starmer who told the BBC this morning that he wants to bring together those countries [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=60.4s)]
*  like the UK keen to act quickly and do the most. We need to be clear what a European security [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=66.16s)]
*  guarantee would look like. I do acknowledge that that's more likely to be in the first instance a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=73.44s)]
*  coalition of the willing in other words we've got to find those countries in Europe that are [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=79.84s)]
*  prepared to be a bit more forward-leaning. And after Friday night spat in the White House. Mr [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=84.48s)]
*  President can you get things back on track today? The Prime Minister is working with the French [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=90.08s)]
*  President Emmanuel Macron on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss it with the United States. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump ever be a reliable partner sir? Can Europe come together and come up with a plan? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=100.88s)]
*  And the cast list completes with the arrival of President Zelensky of Ukraine. Would you be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  willing to apologize to Donald Trump Mr President? A leader with plenty to talk about outside and in. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=111.92s)]
*  The Prime Minister and 18 others trying to pull off a balancing act keeping America on side and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=119.52s)]
*  putting an arm around Ukraine. Both matter, Sakir insists, for our safety as well as Keeves. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=125.6s)]
*  We gathered here today because this is a once in a generation moment for the security of Europe. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=132.8s)]
*  For around two hours they talked and then some of them talked to us, the President of the European [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  Commission saying EU countries will need to increase defense spending massively. Why? Listen [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  to the memorable imagery she chose. It's basically turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=153.44s)]
*  indigestible for potential invaders and therefore the focus is not only on the military supply but [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  also for example securing the energy system and making sure that over time this is a strong and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=168.96s)]
*  resilient country. Have you won the argument with European colleagues about stepping up to the plate? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=175.36s)]
*  Absolutely, we all have understood that after a long time of under investment it is now of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  utmost importance to step up the defense investment for a prolonged period of time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=186.08s)]
*  And what of the North Atlantic Defense Alliance, NATO, America for so long at [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=192.24s)]
*  it's hard but now with an unpredictable president? I think it was a good meeting, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  it was a very good meeting because what you see is European countries stepping up. First of all [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=202.4s)]
*  make sure that Ukraine has got what it needs to stay in the fight as long as it has to continue. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=209.44s)]
*  What we also see is European countries really ramping up to help with security guarantees [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=216.88s)]
*  for the moment when a peace deal would be struck. Obviously there is no deal yet, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=223.92s)]
*  there is no ceasefire yet but we have to prepare for that moment. The Prime Minister told us those [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=228.88s)]
*  countries up for getting involved in delivering and maintaining peace in Ukraine are now working [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=234.72s)]
*  up their plans. Those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency. The UK is prepared [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=239.92s)]
*  to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air together with others. Europe must do [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=247.84s)]
*  the heavy listing but to support peace in our continent and to succeed this effort must have [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=255.68s)]
*  strong US backing. And he added, today I'm announcing a new deal which allows Ukraine to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=264.16s)]
*  use 1.6 billion pounds of UK export finance to buy more than 5,000 air defence missiles [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=271.68s)]
*  which will be made in Belfast creating jobs in our brilliant defence sector. After what happened [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=280.0s)]
*  the other night between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, do you feel a greater personal [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  responsibility alongside President Macron and others for delivering a workable peace? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=291.28s)]
*  And on the coalition of the willing as you've described it today, are you persuading more people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=297.52s)]
*  to join it? On the question of responsibility I do think the United Kingdom should set up and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=303.76s)]
*  lead. We have done that historically as a nation and we need to do it again. On the coalition of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=311.52s)]
*  the willing, yes a number of countries have indicated today that they want to be part of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=320.16s)]
*  the plan that we are developing. I'll leave them to make their own statements about exactly how [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=326.88000000000005s)]
*  they want to make that contribution. So a number of countries he says but we don't know how many. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=331.68s)]
*  Earlier Westminster's biggest opposition parties gave us their take on these fast moving events, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=337.92s)]
*  the Conservatives focusing on defence spending. This is a fundamental question. When I was in [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  cabinet we talked about getting to three percent by 2030 and we couldn't make the numbers work. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=348.4s)]
*  We need to find a way to make the numbers work because the world is changing very quickly [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  and with things like defence you can't make a decision at the last minute. Liberal Democrats [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=358.32s)]
*  have been arguing for some time about the need to work with our European neighbours more closely [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  whether it's on our economy or on our security and I think recent developments have shown that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=368.4s)]
*  that is absolutely the way to go. For Ukraine's leader after the summit another appointment. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  Tonight a moment Donald Trump craves but Volodymyr Zelensky is seeing him already. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=379.44s)]
*  He flew to Sandringham in Norfolk meeting the King. Ukraine's future, a continent's future. Today a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  big day among many big days. Europe in an era of war and Donald Trump. Chris Mason BBC News at Lancaster House. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=391.12s)]
*  Chris Mason, the former president of Ukraine. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=400.64s)]
*  Following his meeting with King Charles, President Zelensky sat down with journalists before returning to Kiev [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=402.64s)]
*  and he was asked whether he'd apologise to Donald Trump for the public row at the White House on Friday. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=407.68s)]
*  Laura Kunzberg was at that briefing with the Ukrainian leader. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=413.2s)]
*  He's resisted Russia's attacks for three long bitter years of war. On Friday he fought off the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=418.8s)]
*  American president's barbs too but after two days of turmoil tonight speaking in his own language [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=424.56s)]
*  President Zelensky wanted to make sure he was understood. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=431.2s)]
*  I traveled in the train for 12 hours then for 11 hours I flew because the president of the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=436.8s)]
*  United States invited me. But after Friday's fevered meeting how can he make peace with [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=443.92s)]
*  President Trump if that's what's required in order to bring the real war to an end? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=452.72s)]
*  Surely to get the security guarantee that you crave you do need to rebuild your relationship [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=458.08000000000004s)]
*  with President Trump. Will you as the White House is still asking you to do apologize [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=462.88000000000005s)]
*  or express any regret for how you handled the meeting? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=470.16s)]
*  All that we want from partners is the constructive dialogue [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  so that they remember who the aggressor is. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  Are you willing in principle to talk about conceding territory, in principle to express [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  some regret of President Trump or to sign the minerals deal? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=488.64s)]
*  We are constructive if we agreed upon signing it. We were ready to sign it and honestly I believe [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  that the United States would be ready as well. Perhaps there is a need in time to analyze [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=502.72s)]
*  certain things but I would just want Ukrainian position to be heard. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=508.8s)]
*  Too early to talk concessions he told us our freedom our values are not for sale [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=515.84s)]
*  but he welcomed proposals from the UK France and others to offer European troops to guard [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=521.84s)]
*  potential peace one day. Yet the warmth of a British welcome and European promises are not [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=527.12s)]
*  the same as the raw power of American backing. President Zelensky wants all three to bring the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  agony of his people to an end. Laura Kuntzberg, BBC News, Stansted. We're going to go to Russia. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=540.48s)]
*  Steve Rosenberg is live in Moscow for us now. Lots happening in Europe on all of this Steve. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=548.48s)]
*  What's been the reaction from where you are? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=554.16s)]
*  Well tonight on social media Dmitry Medvedev the former Russian president, someone considered to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=559.76s)]
*  be close to Vladimir Putin, posted this about the London summit. He called it an anti-Trump [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=565.28s)]
*  anti-Russian coven. In other words like a gathering of witches and said that those people who take [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=571.52s)]
*  part wanted the war to continue. Now what's interesting about that I think is the phrase [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=576.16s)]
*  anti-Trump. The Russian government newspaper used the same phrase anti-Trump on its website [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=581.12s)]
*  tonight in its reporting and I think it's clear that after today Moscow's message to the White [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=587.12s)]
*  House will be dear President Trump the Europeans are against you they're against Russia and they're [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=593.36s)]
*  against peace. We know what the Russians are against that is the idea of having European [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=598.72s)]
*  peacekeepers in Ukraine because Russian officials have made that point several times over the last [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=603.52s)]
*  few weeks and again today Sergei Lavrov the foreign minister in an interview said that the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=609.12s)]
*  plan for peacekeepers in Ukraine is a continuation of attempts to egg on the Kiev regime to fight a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=614.8s)]
*  war against Russia and Russian state television tonight poured scorn on the idea of European [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=620.96s)]
*  peacekeepers. It said that you could fill Wembley Stadium with the British army and still have room [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=626.72s)]
*  for some of the French army. All right Steve thank you Steve Rosenberg there live in Moscow. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=632.4s)]
*  Chris and Jeremy are here with me. To you Chris first what a pickle the Prime Minister was in [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=638.96s)]
*  having to walk that fine line between keeping Donald Trump on side and continuing support for [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=644.48s)]
*  President Zelensky. Has he fallen off that tightrope? It's so interesting isn't it because there's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=650.0s)]
*  Russia, Moscow picking away at that exact vulnerability that sense of a divided West. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=654.6400000000001s)]
*  What was striking today was that there was a warmth there was a feeling of camaraderie [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=661.6s)]
*  I guess in contrast with what we saw in the White House 48 hours ago but also the soundtrack of a [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=665.92s)]
*  continent collectively thinking that things have got real that Europe needs to try and reprop up [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=671.36s)]
*  this plan for peace but also a recognition again Clive from the Prime Minister that Europe will [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=676.88s)]
*  need America so he's trying to maintain that balance. Domestically and this might sound [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  parochial in the context of an international conversation lots of support here in the UK [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=688.0s)]
*  across politics for what the Prime Minister is trying to achieve. He's had a bumpy start domestically [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=692.48s)]
*  in many senses Kier Stammer but he has seized this crisis and he is shaping events alongside others [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=697.2s)]
*  and of course big implications of what he's talking about if a deal can be done talking about soldiers [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=702.64s)]
*  and British airmen and women being involved in keeping the peace. There's loads more diplomacy [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=708.64s)]
*  to come this balancing act will continue I think we'll see the Prime Minister on the road again [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=713.84s)]
*  trying to maintain that balancing act in the coming weeks and clearly still a huge amount [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=718.0s)]
*  unresolved. Sure Jeremy, Sir Kier Stammer talking about a coalition of the willing, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=723.04s)]
*  rumours tonight as well of calls for a one-month ceasefire this is being reported by Le Monde [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  in France as coming from the French. How would you assess where we are in terms of trying to [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=734.0s)]
*  map out some kind of way forward in reaching some kind of ceasefire or peace deal? Well I think first [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=740.4799999999999s)]
*  of all President Zelensky will feel a lot happier going home after this meeting in London than he [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=745.44s)]
*  would have had he taken the direct route from Washington DC because he will have all that support [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=751.2s)]
*  ringing in his ears and the possibility it might turn from good wishes into hard tangible support [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=757.12s)]
*  for Ukraine because at the same time in America the same messages are coming out the same kind of [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  things he was hearing there that he needs to compromise he might even need to resign that [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=769.5200000000001s)]
*  sort of thing and positive stuff going towards Moscow from them too reported in the New York [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=774.16s)]
*  Times that the Defense Secretary Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to cease offensive cyber [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=779.8399999999999s)]
*  operations against the Russians so another thing the Russians might like while pressure on Ukraine [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=787.12s)]
*  continues now why is this such a hard thing for Kier Stammer and the others to get to a deal? Well [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  it's about a lot more than real estate whatever Mr Trump might think it's not a question of how [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=801.52s)]
*  much Putin gets to keep and how much Zelensky has to give up for the Ukrainians it's about sovereignty [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=807.76s)]
*  it's about independence it's about being their own boss and not being back under the control of [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=813.36s)]
*  Moscow but for Putin now Putin has said often that he doesn't believe that there is such an [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=819.36s)]
*  independent entity as a Ukraine or a Ukrainian and maybe his attitude is echoing a well-known [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  phrase by a well-known saying by Mr Brzezinski who was a former American national security advisor [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=835.7600000000001s)]
*  he said without Ukraine Russia ceases to be an empire and he was saying this when the USSR was [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=843.44s)]
*  falling but with Ukraine suborned and subordinated Russia automatically becomes an empire so in other [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  words for Putin it's about his place in the world so a one month ceasefire against that [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=858.64s)]
*  well it doesn't sound that attractive. All right Jeremy Bowen International Editor Chris Mason [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WvS4RjnRdA&t=864.96s)]
