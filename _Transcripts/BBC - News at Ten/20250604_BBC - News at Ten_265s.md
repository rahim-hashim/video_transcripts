Video Description: Vladimir Putin has said he will respond “very strongly” to Ukraine's major drone attack on Russian airbases, US President Donald Trump has warned.
Speaking after a phone call with the Russian president, Trump said: "President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields."  Moscow said that military options were "on the table".
Trump also said that his phone call Putin would not "lead to immediate peace" between Russia and Ukraine. Russian state media said Putin told Trump that Ukraine has tried to "disrupt" negotiations and that the government in Kyiv has "essentially turned into a terrorist organisation".
It was the first conversation between the two leaders since Ukraine launched its surprise attack on Russian military airbases using drones, destroying what it said were nuclear-capable long-range bombers.  Trump is reported to have told Putin in the call that the US was not warned in advance of the attack.
A week ago Trump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Putin, threatening to change how the US is responding to Russia if he believed Putin was "tapping" him along on peace efforts in Ukraine.  It was one of a string of critical remarks by Trump, who on 26 May said that Putin had gone "absolutely crazy" and was "playing with fire", after Russia stepped up drone and missile attacks on cities in Ukraine, killing dozens of civilians. 
The leaders’ phone call comes days after a second round of direct peace talks in Istanbul between the warring sides ended without a breakthrough, although they agreed to swap more prisoners of war. Ukrainian negotiators said Russia had rejected an "unconditional ceasefire”,  a key demand of Kyiv and its Western allies including the US.

# Putin will avenge destruction of Russian warplanes by Ukraine warns Donald Trump | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs)
*  Vladimir Putin has promised revenge for Ukraine's drone strikes on Russian airbases at the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=0.0s)]
*  He discussed his response during a surprise phone call with President Trump this afternoon, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=6.76s)]
*  which the U.S. president then posted about on social media. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=11.4s)]
*  Ukraine says 41 Russian planes were damaged or destroyed in their attacks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=15.52s)]
*  One of the airbases was at least 3,000 miles from the Ukrainian border. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=20.28s)]
*  In a moment, we'll get the latest from Washington, but first from Kyiv. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=24.8s)]
*  Our diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams, sent this report. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=28.32s)]
*  And then the containers used to transport the drones to airfields deep inside Russia, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=58.32s)]
*  looking for all the world like mobile homes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=63.0s)]
*  Retractable roofs visible. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=66.32s)]
*  Ukraine offering carefully calculated glimpses of its work. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=68.52s)]
*  And rewarding those who carried it out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=74.16s)]
*  President Zelensky handing medals to officers whose identities, for obvious reasons, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=76.84s)]
*  were not in the air. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=81.44s)]
*  A ceasefire could have happened before the operation, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=84.28s)]
*  Would the operation have taken place in that case? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=88.48s)]
*  No, but it doesn't mean we do nothing in the meantime. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=91.44s)]
*  But the Russian leader seems in no mood to budge. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=95.44s)]
*  He's not even talking about the operation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=98.64s)]
*  He's just saying that the operation could have been stopped before the operation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=101.28s)]
*  But the Russian leader is not even talking about the operation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=106.72s)]
*  The Russian leader seems in no mood to budge, clearly incensed by recent events. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=110.36s)]
*  They're asking for a ceasefire for 30 or 60 days. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  They're asking for a summit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  But how can we have such meetings in these conditions? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=123.28s)]
*  What is there to talk about? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=126.32s)]
*  How can we negotiate with terrorists? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=128.16s)]
*  Why should we encourage them by giving them a pause in fighting? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=131.04s)]
*  None of this bodes well for Donald Trump's efforts to end this war. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=135.16s)]
*  He's speaking to Mr Putin for the first time since Sunday's attacks [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=139.32s)]
*  and sounding a starkly pessimistic note. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  It was a good conversation, the president wrote on social media, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=146.12s)]
*  but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=149.44s)]
*  President Putin did say, and very strongly, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=155.72s)]
*  For all the sound and fury of this week, there is still a diplomatic process. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=161.0s)]
*  In a few days' time, we should see the largest prisoner swap of the war so far. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=165.96s)]
*  But as for a ceasefire, well, that remains a very elusive prospect. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=170.72s)]
*  Paul Adams, BBC News, Kiev. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=175.4s)]
*  And let's get the latest from Washington and our correspondent there, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=178.68s)]
*  Gary O'Donoghue. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=181.88s)]
*  Gary, President Trump not sounding as optimistic tonight [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=183.2s)]
*  as he did just a week or two ago. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=189.72s)]
*  A markedly different tone in terms of this conversation, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=193.72s)]
*  a shorter conversation and also one where he admits that peace isn't [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=197.64s)]
*  anywhere near around the corner. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=202.6s)]
*  We do know, of course, that he's been trying to enforce this ceasefire, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=205.48s)]
*  this 30-day pause, but there doesn't seem to be any appetite for that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=210.2s)]
*  Also, we're seeing tonight that Vladimir Zelensky is intervening in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=214.6s)]
*  the discussion as well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=218.48s)]
*  He's not directing his comments immediately at Donald Trump, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=219.48s)]
*  but I think it's clear where he's talking. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  He's saying that Vladimir Putin is giving the middle finger, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  in his words, to those who hesitate to increase pressure on Russia. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  And he's also saying that the powerful, if they don't stop Vladimir Putin, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=234.64s)]
*  then they share the responsibility. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, we know that Donald Trump, because he said so, has a red line in his [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=240.32s)]
*  head beyond which he will walk away from this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=244.92s)]
*  He hasn't said precisely where that is, but I think the sense tonight [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=248.2s)]
*  is that we're getting ever closer to it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=251.96s)]
*  And if that comes along with the end of military and financial aid to Ukraine, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  that could be incredibly serious for them continuing the war. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=258.48s)]
*  Gary, thank you. Gary O'Donoghue there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0woU7dnxqs&t=263.08s)]
