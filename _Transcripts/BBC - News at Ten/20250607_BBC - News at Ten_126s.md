Video Description: The actor, former California governor and environmental campaigner Arnold Schwarzenegger has said people should "stop whining" about President Trump's approach to climate change and understand  they must take action themselves. 
Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the Austrian World Summit, organised by the Schwarzenegger's Climate Initiative, he said the US President could not prevent progress on tackling the threat of global warming. 
Donald Trump has reversed many US initiatives to support the environment and pulled out of international agreements to tackle climate change. 
However Mr Schwarzenegger said the question for people was:  “What do you do?  We all have a responsibility.  You think action comes only for the whole world out of Washington, the White House?”
He said people needed to understand the obstacles to change but not use them as an excuse for inaction.

*  Vienna, Mr Schwarzenegger says he doesn't believe the White House [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=11.32s)]
*  can stop the changes that are required. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=14.24s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Arnold Schwarzenegger! [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=16.76s)]
*  Arnie doesn't do anything by halves, not just lifting weights, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=20.6s)]
*  but blitzing the competition. Not just acting, but movies making [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=24.48s)]
*  billions at the box office and as a campaigner, never taking no [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=28.6s)]
*  for an answer. After decades of environmental activism, he has a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=32.6s)]
*  blunt message for those bemoaning the attitude of Donald Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=36.8s)]
*  He's reversed many green measures and pulled out of international [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=40.6s)]
*  agreements on climate change. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=44.24s)]
*  And I tell them, I said, hey, stop whining. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=46.96s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=51.08s)]
*  I said, we all have a responsibility. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=53.24s)]
*  What do you think the action comes only for the whole world out of? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Washington, the White House? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=58.36s)]
*  No. I said, most of the action is happening on a local level and on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=60.52s)]
*  the state level. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=65.24s)]
*  So people should just ignore Donald Trump then when he talks about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=66.68s)]
*  the environment? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=70.16s)]
*  I wouldn't say ignore it. I think you can be aware of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=71.0s)]
*  You have to be aware of your obstacles, but you should not go [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=73.6s)]
*  and use them as an excuse, is my point. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=76.76s)]
*  You know, you've got to go all out. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=79.84s)]
*  Do I have a vision? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=81.56s)]
*  I mean, imagine that when I was 15 years old, my vision was to go [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=82.8s)]
*  to America and to be a bodybuilding champion and to get into acting [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  and to do big movies, Hollywood movies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=91.08000000000001s)]
*  What do you think the obstacles there were? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Endless amount of obstacles. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=97.72s)]
*  And it was very difficult. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=99.76s)]
*  It was a grind. So did I surrender? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Did I go in wine? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=103.12s)]
*  No. I just said, OK, here are the obstacles. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  This is what they have to overcome. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  And I made it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=108.28s)]
*  Schwarzenegger is no fan of Donald Trump, but he doesn't want his own [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  environmental cause to stall because of shifting winds. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  But hard times, including in the UK, have seen appetite to take action [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=117.56s)]
*  on the environment fade. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkH2FS2vaI&t=122.12s)]
