Video Description: A former security contractor for Gaza's controversial new Israel- and US-backed aid distribution sites has told the BBC he witnessed colleagues opening fire with machine guns on hungry Palestinian civilians who had posed no threat.  In one such incident he said he witnessed a man in the crowd fall motionless to the ground and a guard who had been shooting laughed about it. 
On another occasion he said a guard opened fire from a watchtower with a machine gun because a group of women, children and elderly people was moving too slowly away from the site.
When asked to respond the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said the allegations were categorically false.
They referred us to a statement saying that no civilians ever came under fire at the GHF distribution sites.
The GHF began its operations in Gaza at the end of May, distributing limited aid from several sites in southern and central Gaza. That followed an 11-week total blockade of Gaza by Israel during which no food entered the territory.
The system has been widely criticised for forcing vast numbers of people to walk through active combat zones to a handful of sites. 
Since the GHF started up, Israeli forces have killed more than 400 Palestinians trying to retrieve food aid from its sites, the UN and local doctors say. Israel says the new distribution system stops aid going to Hamas.
Describing the incident at one of the GHF sites - in which he said guards fired on a group of Palestinians - the former contractor said: "As that happened, another contractor on location, standing on the berm overlooking the exit, opened up with 15 to 20 shots of repetitive weapons fire at the crowd.  "A Palestinian man dropped to the ground motionless. And then the other contractor who was standing there was like, 'damn, I think you got one'. And then they laughed about it."
The contractor, who spoke to us on condition of anonymity, said GHF managers had brushed off his report as a coincidence, suggesting that the Palestinian man could have "tripped" or been "tired and passed out".
The GHF claimed the man who made these allegations is a "disgruntled former contractor" who they had terminated for misconduct, which he denies.

*  Since the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation centers opened in May, the United Nations [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=11.6s)]
*  says more than 400 Palestinians have reportedly been killed near the sites. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  And this week, hundreds of charities said that Israeli soldiers routinely opened fire [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=22.52s)]
*  on Gazans seeking aid. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=27.7s)]
*  Israel denies this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=29.8s)]
*  But the whistleblower says that staff working for the Foundation also used machine guns [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=31.48s)]
*  to fire on Palestinians who pose no threat. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=36.68s)]
*  The Foundation has said the claims are categorically false. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=39.86s)]
*  Lucy Williamson sent this report from Jerusalem, as Israel has barred international journalists [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=43.56s)]
*  from entering Gaza independently. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=48.86s)]
*  Days after Gaza's new aid operation began, one U.S. security guard was already having [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  doubts. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=58.88s)]
*  He gave us this footage from inside Site Number 4, showing colleagues firing on a departing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  crowd of Palestinians, he said. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=66.86s)]
*  First machine gun fire from a watchtower, then more than 20 shots from a nearby guard. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  When this guy was shooting into this group, this man dropped to the ground and was motionless. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=79.76s)]
*  Then the other contractor who was standing there was like, damn, I think you got one. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=84.64s)]
*  And then they laughed about it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=89.36s)]
*  The former security contractor, who asked that we hide his identity, said his complaints [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=93.56s)]
*  were ignored. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=98.24s)]
*  I brought this to the attention of the leadership directly. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=100.0s)]
*  I was like, I don't... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=102.76s)]
*  And then the leadership said to me, well, you have no way of knowing that that person [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=104.48s)]
*  was hit with a bullet. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=109.64s)]
*  Maybe they tripped. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=111.38s)]
*  Maybe they were tired and they passed out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  He said he witnessed several occasions when contractors shot at or injured Palestinians, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=116.1s)]
*  including one woman who was lifted limp and unconscious onto a donkey cart after being [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  hit with a stun grenade. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=125.94s)]
*  Team leaders referred to Gazans as the zombie horde, he said, and instead of clear rules [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=128.32s)]
*  of engagement, had given this advice to contractors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=133.82s)]
*  You have the inherent right of self-defense. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=138.18s)]
*  If there's anything that you feel uncomfortable with, shoot and ask questions later. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=140.56s)]
*  If you feel threatened, shoot, shoot to kill and ask questions later. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=146.32s)]
*  That's a direct quote. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=151.44s)]
*  That's a direct quote. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  And if we're on a site and somebody is any way aggressive towards you, take them out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=154.84s)]
*  GHF said the claims were false and that civilians had never come under fire at one of its sites. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=160.96s)]
*  But an internal report seen by the BBC suggests significant numbers of Gazans were harmed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  in some way during distribution over a 12-day period. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=173.7s)]
*  The GHF narrative that no one at a site has been injured, hurt, shot at is an absolute [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=177.44s)]
*  bold-faced lie. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=186.04s)]
*  And they know it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=188.48s)]
*  It's not a, oh, we didn't know that or, oh, we weren't aware of that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=189.92s)]
*  They are aware of it because I made them aware of it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=193.28s)]

*  This new distribution system, which Israel says is designed to stop aid going to Hamas, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mfewbo4Rfg&t=198.24s)]
