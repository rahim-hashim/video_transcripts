*  The phone call follows the biggest Russian drone and missile attack of the war. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=11.72s)]
*  Ukraine says Moscow fired 550 drones and 11 missiles overnight. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=16.68s)]
*  Rescue workers say one person died and 26 were injured. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=22.56s)]
*  Our senior international correspondent Oleg Iryan has been to northeastern Ukraine, near [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=26.4s)]
*  Sumy and the Russian border, and seen Ukrainian troops in action against drone attacks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=30.56s)]
*  Her report begins with last night's bombardment of Kiev, where almost every district of the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=36.54s)]
*  city was affected. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  A night of terror in a capital under attack. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=49.56s)]
*  The drones kept coming in the darkest hours. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=55.14s)]
*  The largest such attack since the start of the war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=61.14s)]
*  It came just hours after Vladimir Putin put down the phone following a call with Donald [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=68.26s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  Civilians forced to shelter underground from this waking nightmare. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=77.06s)]
*  The Kremlin's message to Ukraine written in the dawn skies. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=83.58s)]
*  No ceasefire in sight here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=88.64s)]
*  And no respite for Ukrainian troops trying to stop the drones. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=93.58s)]
*  Here with only heavy machine guns. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=109.0s)]
*  An unequal fight. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=112.28s)]
*  Well, they've just opened fire again. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  They've spotted another Shahid drone. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=123.2s)]
*  And there is another unit we can hear that are also firing in the distance. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=126.56s)]
*  And they're going to try and bring the drone down with this gun. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=129.88s)]
*  It's a nightly battle for this territorial defence brigade in the Sumy region bordering [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=141.56s)]
*  Russia. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=147.92s)]
*  Most drones targeting Kiev fly through here, right over their heads. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=152.48s)]
*  What's the feeling for you and for your team when you see the drones getting through? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=159.56s)]
*  Well, it's not very good. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=165.76s)]
*  You feel a slight sadness, but to be honest, as you have seen, you don't have time for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  emotions. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=175.16s)]
*  One comes in and another can come right behind it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=176.72s)]
*  For more than a year already, every day is like Groundhog Day. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=180.28s)]
*  And everything that moves is a target. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=186.8s)]
*  This bus full of civilians was ripped apart by a Russian drone in Sumy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=190.12s)]
*  Nine people were killed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=196.08s)]
*  Margarita Husakova was pulled from the wreckage, but lost three of her loved ones. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=201.08s)]
*  Her mother, her uncle and her sister. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  I told my sister, don't come here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  There are explosions. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  But she came anyway. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  She spent a month at my place. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=222.2s)]
*  Everything was fine. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  But once we boarded that bus, that was it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=227.2s)]
*  Margarita cannot forget how she last saw her sister, her broken body lying on the ground. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  One more family destroyed in President Putin's quest for victory. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=244.96s)]
*  Orla Girin, BBC News, Sumy, Ukraine. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  As we mentioned, President Zelenskyy has spoken to US President Trump on the phone today. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's get the very latest from Paul Adams, who is in Ukraine's capital tonight. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  What is happening right now where you are, Paul? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  In the last hour or so, we have had more air activity. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  We could see anti-aircraft fire in the distance. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  We could hear some distant explosions. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=283.0s)]
*  We don't know if we're in for another night like we had last night. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=285.04s)]
*  Last night was one of the worst in the capital in recent months, certainly in terms of the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  sheer numbers of drones that flew in, in wave after wave throughout the night. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=293.04s)]
*  All of this, of course, adds to President Zelenskyy's argument that this country needs [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  more help in defending its skies. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=302.68s)]
*  And that help seemed to be in jeopardy earlier this week when news came that the United States [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=304.96s)]
*  was suspending some of its arms deliveries to Ukraine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=309.84s)]
*  Now, as you say, President Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have spoken today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=313.2s)]
*  And after that meeting, President Zelenskyy said it had been an important and fruitful [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=317.12s)]
*  meeting and that the two leaders had discussed ways to improve Ukraine's air defenses. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=321.84s)]
*  We don't know exactly what that means. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=328.2s)]
*  Possibly more patriot air defense missiles from the United States, possibly help for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=330.64s)]
*  Ukraine in finding them elsewhere. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=336.0s)]
*  In the meantime, Ukraine's European allies are set to discuss the so-called coalition [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  of the willing in the margins of an Anglo-French summit next week. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=344.0s)]
*  They will be discussing all sorts of ways of bolstering Ukraine's defenses. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  But of course, that coalition of the willing can only happen if and when there is a ceasefire [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=353.28s)]
*  on the ground here in Ukraine. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=358.4s)]
*  And at the moment, all negotiations about a ceasefire seem to have come to a dead end. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnRqrepglmk&t=360.84s)]
