Video Description: German police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are carrying out new searches in Portugal, in the area where she went missing 18 years ago.   
The 3-year-old British toddler disappeared from a holiday apartment in the resort of Praja de Luz in 2007.
The chief suspect is Christian Brueckner, who used to live nearby.  He’s a convicted child sex offender but has denied any involvement in Madeleine McCann's disappearance.  He’s currently serving a 7-year prison sentence in Germany for rape and is due for release by next year.
German detectives have made clear that their investigation into the McCann case is a murder inquiry.

**BBC - News at Ten:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A)
*  Police in Portugal say new searches are taking place until Friday by German officers investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=0.0s)]
*  The three-year-old went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve in 2007. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=9.0s)]
*  Jessica Parker has more from Berlin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=15.0s)]
*  It's 18 years since Madeleine McCann disappeared from the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=17.0s)]
*  Now news of a fresh search. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=24.0s)]
*  In an area that includes the holiday apartment from where the British toddler went missing and a house where the chief suspect used to live. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=27.0s)]
*  That's Christian Bruckner, a convicted child sex offender. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=35.0s)]
*  He's never been charged in the McCann case and has denied involvement. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=39.0s)]
*  The 48-year-old is already in jail in Germany for raping a pensioner in Portugal in 2005. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=44.0s)]
*  But the end of his sentence is approaching. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=52.0s)]
*  German prosecutors are deeply aware that Christian Bruckner is due for release either later this year or early next. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=55.0s)]
*  As a result, their investigations into him have been characterised as a race against time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=62.0s)]
*  Their last major search in Portugal's Algarve region happened two years ago at this remote reservoir. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=67.0s)]
*  This latest operation is set to last all week as part of what German police have classed as a murder inquiry. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=74.0s)]
*  But they've kept the full details of their investigation under wraps. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=82.0s)]
*  Now a new effort to find clues, it seems, in this most high profile of cases. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=032jrBDF34A&t=86.0s)]
