Video Description: Donald Trump has demanded Iran’s unconditional surrender saying the US may kill the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Writing on Truth Social, the US President stated:  “We know exactly where the so-called Supreme Leader is hiding”, and described Ayatollah Khamenei as an “easy target”.  Mr Trump said: “we are not going to take him out (kill!),  at least not for now".  He went on to say “our patience is wearing thin”.  In another post he demanded Iran's "unconditional surrender". 
Mr Trump held a meeting with his national security advisers at the White House as more US warplanes headed for the Middle East.   There’s mounting speculation that the US could join Israel directly in its war with Iran, which began five days ago with Israeli attacks on nuclear sites.    Israel has said its aim is to prevent Iran building a nuclear weapon.  However many of Iran’s nuclear sites are deep underground and only the US has weapons powerful enough to threaten them. 
Millions of Iranians have been fleeing the capital Tehran where there have been reports of more explosions, with major roads out of the city gridlocked.    Iran warned people in Israel to evacuate the cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa.

# Trump threatens to kill Iran's leader Ali Khamenei and demands 'unconditional surrender' | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw)
*  President Trump has called on Iran for unconditional surrender. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=0.0s)]
*  In a flurry of posts on his social media this afternoon, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump called Iran's supreme leader an easy target, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=8.4s)]
*  but said that the U.S. was not going to kill him, at least not yet. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=12.0s)]
*  U.S. fighter jets are understood to be on their way to the Middle East, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=16.2s)]
*  as speculation grows that the U.S. could become directly involved [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=19.8s)]
*  in the war between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=23.6s)]
*  Tonight, Donald Trump has met his national security team [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=26.2s)]
*  to decide America's next move. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=29.2s)]
*  Well, this is Tel Aviv tonight. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=31.8s)]
*  Iran has fired more missiles into Israel, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=33.4s)]
*  but there are no reports so far of any impacts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=36.2s)]
*  As millions flee Tehran today, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=40.0s)]
*  we will ask if the U.S. is about to get involved in the war, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=41.8s)]
*  and whether the regime in Iran could be about to fall. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  But first, here's Tom Bateman with the latest from Washington. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=49.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's nighttime dash back to Washington [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=55.0s)]
*  unleashed more uncertainty on a region at war [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=57.8s)]
*  and a frenzy of questions asked at 40,000 feet. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=61.4s)]
*  First, what about French President Macron's remark [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  about an Israel-Iran ceasefire plan? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  We're looking for a ceasefire. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=71.0s)]
*  We're not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=73.2s)]
*  I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=74.6s)]
*  That was Emmanuel, nice guy, but he doesn't get it right too often. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=76.2s)]
*  But we're not looking. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=80.8s)]
*  We're looking for better than a ceasefire. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=82.6s)]
*  The president then turned to an ultimatum [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=85.6s)]
*  for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=87.8s)]
*  saying he was an easy target. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=91.6s)]
*  We're not going to take him out, kill, at least not for now, he posted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=93.8s)]
*  But we don't want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=102.8s)]
*  In another post, Mr. Trump said he expected unconditional surrender. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. is already helping Israel shoot down incoming missiles [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  as Iran retaliates to Israel's attacks. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=115.2s)]
*  But so far, Washington has said its role is limited to that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=118.2s)]
*  Mr. Trump has veered between threats to Tehran [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=122.2s)]
*  and highlighting that the U.S. isn't involved. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=125.4s)]
*  But today's sudden shift has led to mounting speculation [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=128.6s)]
*  over what's coming next. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=132.0s)]
*  Over the past three days, at least 30 U.S. military planes [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=134.4s)]
*  have been moved from bases in America to Europe. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=138.0s)]
*  They are all KC-135 tanker aircraft used to refuel fighter jets and bombers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=141.2s)]
*  These pictures taken in Suffolk today [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=148.0s)]
*  appear to show an aerial refueling tanker accompanied by four fighter jets. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=150.2s)]
*  One military expert told the BBC the flights were highly unusual [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=155.6s)]
*  and suggestive of contingency plans [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=160.0s)]
*  to support intensive combat operations in the Middle East. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=162.2s)]
*  U.S. officials are keeping their options open. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=166.2s)]
*  We believe that Iran, as President has said from the beginning, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=169.0s)]
*  should not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=172.2s)]
*  That position hasn't changed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=173.6s)]
*  They can give it up peacefully. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=175.2s)]
*  That position hasn't changed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=176.2s)]
*  And as a result right now, we've got assets in the region [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=177.8s)]
*  and we're going to defend them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=180.6s)]
*  Israel wants these to join in its strikes, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=182.0s)]
*  American B-2 stealth bombers, planes it doesn't have. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=185.4s)]
*  These could be used to strike Iran's uranium enrichment site at Fordow. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=189.8s)]
*  Hidden deep underground, it has long been a key target for the Israelis. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=195.0s)]
*  But only the U.S. is thought to have the bomb needed, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=199.6s)]
*  the massive ordnance penetrator to destroy it, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=202.6s)]
*  a factor that has added to the pressure [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=206.2s)]
*  Israel's leader has put on the president. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=208.4s)]
*  But Mr. Trump has also been pushing his desire for a deal with Iran. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=211.6s)]
*  He still said he hasn't ruled out sending his envoy, Steve Wicoff, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=215.8s)]
*  to meet the Iranians. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=219.6s)]
*  How much of this maneuvering is meant to force Tehran's hand [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=222.0s)]
*  as opposed to a planned U.S. action [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=226.0s)]
*  is so far known only to Mr. Trump and his closest advisors. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=228.8s)]
*  But as the world waits, America's military might is on the move. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=233.2s)]
*  Tom Bateman, BBC News, Washington. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=238.2s)]
*  Let's speak to our North America editor, Sarah Smith, at the White House. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=241.0s)]
*  So could the United States be about to get directly involved in this war? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=244.2s)]
*  Well, after a meeting with his top advisors in the Situation Room [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=251.2s)]
*  that lasted almost an hour and a half this afternoon and broke up recently, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=254.6s)]
*  U.S. officials are saying that Donald Trump is considering [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=258.0s)]
*  joining Israel in those attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=262.0s)]
*  But it's pretty clear his top advisors are not agreed upon this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=265.2s)]
*  And there are, of course, lots of reasons for America [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=269.2s)]
*  not to get involved in this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=271.6s)]
*  They could easily get dragged into a wider conflict in the Middle East, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=273.2s)]
*  which is absolutely the last thing Donald Trump wants to get involved in. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=276.2s)]
*  But he's not interested. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=280.4s)]
*  Remember, he campaigned for election saying that he would put America first [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=281.4s)]
*  and not get involved in any foreign wars. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=285.4s)]
*  That was a very popular message. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=287.4s)]
*  And some of his most vocal supporters in Congress [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=289.4s)]
*  are also urging him not to do this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=292.4s)]
*  But there's one thing Donald Trump has always been absolutely consistent about [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=295.4s)]
*  and absolutely unequivocal on, and that is him saying [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=299.4s)]
*  Iran cannot have nuclear weapons. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=302.4s)]
*  And he is said to believe that they are now very close to achieving that, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=305.4s)]
*  that he could be talked in to taking some kind of action possibly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  He had wanted to do a deal with Iran, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  to stop them from developing nuclear weapons. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  And there were negotiations and talks about that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  Because, remember, Donald Trump sees himself as a deal-maker supreme, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  and he likes to look at himself as a peacemaker as well. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  But he set a 60-day deadline on those talks, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  and that deadline came and went last week [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  without any kind of agreement. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  So now he is deeply concerned that Iran are not serious about doing a deal, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  and he has just been stringing him along. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=338.8s)]
*  So although he might return to negotiations if they offered it, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=340.8s)]
*  he will feel his hand is much strengthened [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=343.8s)]
*  if there is then a credible threat of military action [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=345.8s)]
*  coming from the United States as well as from Israel. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=348.8s)]
*  Sarah Smith, thank you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=351.8s)]
*  Well, Israel launched its first strikes on Iran five days ago on Friday [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=353.8s)]
*  and what it described as a pre-emptive offensive [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=357.8s)]
*  to neutralise Iran's nuclear programme. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=360.8s)]
*  Targets included nuclear facilities at Isfahan, Natanz and Arak. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=364.0s)]
*  Oil depots and gas refineries across the country have also been targeted [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=369.0s)]
*  and air defence systems, military bases and missile launch sites have been struck. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=374.0s)]
*  Well, the BBC is not allowed to broadcast from inside Iran, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=379.0s)]
*  but our colleagues in BBC Persian are keeping across the situation there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=383.0s)]
*  Siavash Adlan has this report. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=388.0s)]
*  Evacuating a city of 10 million is no easy task. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=391.2s)]
*  Even before President Trump's evacuation warning, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=396.2s)]
*  millions were fleeing the Iranian capital. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=399.2s)]
*  Now the roads out of Tehran are choked with traffic, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=402.2s)]
*  scenes reminiscent of bank holidays, but this is a desperate goodbye. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=405.2s)]
*  On the road, this driver comes across these men, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=410.2s)]
*  confused at first, he realises they are addicts [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=414.2s)]
*  who have fled a rehab centre damaged by the attacks. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=417.4s)]
*  Back in Tehran, the subway, normally bustling with commuters, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=421.4s)]
*  rarely looks like this. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=426.4s)]
*  One Tehran resident who wishes to remain anonymous [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=428.4s)]
*  told us why he is staying. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=431.4s)]
*  Even though I hate the Islamic Republic, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=435.4s)]

*  I'll try to stick to my routines, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=441.4s)]
*  I'll try to find a cafe that's open and go there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=444.59999999999997s)]

*  I'll smile at them, try to lift their spirits, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  I'll call my friends more often, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  support them, make them feel better. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  I think right now we have no one but each other, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  not Benjamin Netanyahu and not Israel, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  they certainly don't care about us, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=462.59999999999997s)]
*  and neither does the Islamic Republic. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=464.59999999999997s)]
*  For those who chose to stay, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  using essential services can be challenging. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  Israeli strikes damaged water installations [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=473.8s)]
*  in affluent northern Tehran, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=476.8s)]
*  while ATMs ran out of cash. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=478.8s)]
*  And these are the studios of Iranian state TV. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=482.8s)]
*  This is not just bombardments and missile attacks. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=488.8s)]
*  Iran is fighting the enemy on its own soil. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=491.8s)]
*  Israel has been infiltrating the country at all levels. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=494.8s)]
*  Car bombs have been detonating. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=498.8s)]
*  And the Iranian intelligence says [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=501.0s)]
*  it has discovered a number of enemy drone factories [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=503.0s)]
*  inside the country. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=506.0s)]
*  And civilians are paying the price. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=508.0s)]
*  This is Tehran's red crescent, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=510.0s)]
*  desperately hoping to find survivors under the rubble. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=512.0s)]
*  Among the lost are nurses, skaters, artists, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=516.0s)]
*  lives cut short. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=521.0s)]
*  Our colleague pressed Israel's UN ambassador [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=525.0s)]
*  on civilian casualties. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=527.0s)]
*  We will do everything we can [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=529.2s)]
*  to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=531.2s)]
*  But, as you said, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=533.2s)]
*  it's a war, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=536.2s)]
*  and we have seen what happened in our cities, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=538.2s)]
*  so we will continue to target the military sites in Iran. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=541.2s)]
*  A few in Washington and Tel Aviv [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=546.2s)]
*  are talking publicly [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=548.2s)]
*  about what happens if the regime collapses. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=550.2s)]
*  Iranians have been documenting [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=554.2s)]
*  how their lives are changing. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=556.2s)]
*  President Trump said he wants to see their country prosper. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  Fewer will be willing to believe him today [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=561.4000000000001s)]
*  than they were just five days ago. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=564.4000000000001s)]
*  Yavash is with me now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  Extraordinary scenes there from Iran, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=569.4000000000001s)]
*  from Tehran just emptying out. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=571.4000000000001s)]
*  Could the regime be about to fall? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=573.4000000000001s)]
*  That can be a very distinct possibility. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=576.4000000000001s)]
*  I think at this point it really depends on the regime itself [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=579.4000000000001s)]
*  judging from what President Trump is saying, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=582.4000000000001s)]
*  judging on the targeting of Israel, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=585.6s)]
*  targeting many military centers [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=588.6s)]
*  rather than political institutions [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=591.6s)]
*  like the parliament or the government. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=593.6s)]
*  Perhaps the U.S. and Israel [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=596.6s)]
*  are not so much after regime change, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=598.6s)]
*  but after, as President Trump said, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=600.6s)]
*  total capitulation, total surrender, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=602.6s)]
*  total humiliation of the Islamic regime. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=605.6s)]
*  What they wish to have is a weakened Islamic regime [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=607.6s)]
*  without its nuclear program [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=610.6s)]
*  unless it refuses to surrender, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  unless the Supreme Leader refuses to surrender. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  Judging again by what President Trump is saying, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  that's when the U.S. may choose to strike [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  the Supreme Leader and eliminate him. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=623.8000000000001s)]
*  After that, obviously, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  the collapse of the regime will be a given. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=628.8000000000001s)]

*  by the Defense Secretary John Healey. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=642.0s)]
*  And at the G7 summit in Canada, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=644.0s)]
*  world leaders have been left guessing [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=646.0s)]
*  what President Trump may do next. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=648.0s)]
*  Our political editor, Chris Mason, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=650.0s)]

*  to Sikir Starmer about the conflict, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=654.0s)]
*  his concerns and what should happen next. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=656.0s)]
*  If the people of Iran rose up against the regime there, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=660.0s)]
*  would you welcome that? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=663.0s)]
*  Well, look, I'm not going to get into [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=665.0s)]
*  what the people of Iran should do. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=668.2s)]
*  I've been really clear. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=670.2s)]
*  I'm very concerned about the nuclear programme [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=672.2s)]
*  that Iran is developing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=674.2s)]
*  That's a unanimous position in the G7. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=676.2s)]
*  Maybe the only way round that is a different regime. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=678.2s)]
*  Israel is obviously threatened [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=680.2s)]
*  and I've been very clear about [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=683.2s)]
*  Israel's right to self-defence. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=685.2s)]
*  This is a conflict which could very well escalate, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=687.2s)]
*  which would have implications for the region, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=690.2s)]
*  implications almost undoubtedly for Gaza, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=692.2s)]
*  and obviously for the economy. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=694.2s)]
*  So does it resolve itself? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=696.4000000000001s)]
*  There is going talk in the region about [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=698.4000000000001s)]
*  people rising up against the regime. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=700.4000000000001s)]

*  about the long-term solution here [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=704.4000000000001s)]
*  to bring a peaceful solution. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=706.4000000000001s)]

*  you'd welcome that? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=713.4000000000001s)]

*  My absolute focus is on the need to de-escalate this. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=724.4s)]
*  How worried are you about the economic impact [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=728.6s)]
*  of the conflict back home on people's bills? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=731.6s)]

*  the impact of international issues [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=736.6s)]
*  back on people back at home. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=739.6s)]
*  Yet another shock. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=742.6s)]
*  Well, you saw with Ukraine the direct impact [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=743.6s)]
*  it had on energy bills and on the cost of living. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=745.6s)]
*  Equally with this conflict with Israel and Iran, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=748.6s)]
*  you can see the effect it's having on the economy, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=751.6s)]
*  particularly the price of energy. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=753.8000000000001s)]
*  And you fear that sort of knock-on for people? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, of course I do. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=756.8000000000001s)]

*  because at a time of conflict globally, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  there is always going to be an impact domestically. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  My job is to insulate and safeguard [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  and mitigate that risk [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=780.8000000000001s)]

*  But Israel's army is making the point [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=807.8s)]
*  that the military barrages appear to be getting smaller, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=810.8s)]
*  and they say that's proof that their strategy [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=813.8s)]
*  of targeting Iran's launchers is working. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=815.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, tonight, there's been speculation [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=818.8s)]
*  on Israeli television about whether the United States [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=821.8s)]
*  will get involved in the military offensive, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=824.8s)]
*  and Israel's national security chief [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=826.8s)]
*  has come out tonight saying [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=828.8s)]
*  the war in Iran won't finish [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=830.8s)]
*  until the underground site at Fordow is attacked. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=832.8s)]
*  That's the site that Israel is thought to have won [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=836.8s)]
*  American help for. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=839.8s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has been very careful [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=841.8s)]
*  to say this is a US decision, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=843.8s)]
*  but he's clearly very keen to have US support [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=845.8s)]
*  amid questions about where this war is going next [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=849.8s)]
*  and how it will end. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD6rVGKpazw&t=852.8s)]
