Video Description: A man has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder after two Israeli embassy staff were shot dead in Washington DC on Wednesday night.
Sarah Lynn Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum when they were attacked.
Elias Rodriguez, who is 30 and from Chicago, was detained at the scene. More charges could come later, law enforcement officials have said , and the FBI is investigating a “manifesto” said to have been written by the suspect.
Police say  Rodriguez was in town for a work conference.  He shouted “free Palestine”  after being taken into custody.
US President Trump said the attack was "based obviously on antisemitism", while DC Mayor Muriel Bowser says "this crime will not be tolerated in our city”.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the leaders of France, the UK and Canada of fuelling antisemitism in a statement after the attack.  He said they were "on the wrong side of humanity and history" after they threatened "concrete action" against Israel this week if it continues its latest military operations in Gaza.

**BBC - News at Ten:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw)
*  A man has been charged with two counts of murder after two Israeli embassy staff were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=0.0s)]
*  shot dead in Washington last night. US authorities say they believe the man acted alone. Following [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=4.96s)]
*  the shooting, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit out at allies, claiming that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=10.86s)]
*  anti-Semitism and anti-Israel incitement by European governments is to blame for the attack. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=16.26s)]
*  Police say the gunman approached the couple, Sarah Milgram and Yaron Lischinsky, and opened [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  fire as they left an event at the Jewish Museum in the city centre last night. Here's Sarah Smith. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=28.52s)]
*  This was a shocking crime in the heart of Washington. A young couple shot dead as they [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=33.72s)]
*  left an evening event at the Jewish Museum. The suspected gunman had been seen pacing back and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=42.64s)]
*  forth outside the museum before the shooting. Eyewitnesses unwittingly sheltered him right after [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=48.72s)]
*  the attack. Around 9 0 7 we heard gunshots and then a guy came in looking really distressed and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=54.24s)]
*  we thought that he just like needed help. He was experiencing whatever violence or something. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=62.2s)]
*  He just needed like safe shelters so he comes in. So people were calming him down, bringing him [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=69.08s)]
*  water, taking care of him. Little did we know he was somebody that executed people in cold blood. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=73.76s)]
*  He was the shooter. The suspect, 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez, gave himself [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=78.72s)]
*  up to the police, telling them where he discarded the gun, shouting pro-Palestinian slogans as he was led away. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=84.2s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=89.8s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=92.68s)]
*  Sarah Milgram from Kansas and Yaron Lischinsky, who was born in Israel, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=95.8s)]
*  met at work when she joined the Israeli embassy about 18 months ago. They quickly started dating [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=101.16s)]
*  and were due to travel to Jerusalem this weekend where she would meet his parents for the first time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=106.36s)]
*  A couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of Free Palestine. It's a young couple about to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=111.88s)]
*  be engaged. The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=120.12s)]
*  to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. The suspect's apartment in Chicago has been raided [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=127.72s)]
*  by police. Social media accounts linked to him display his anger over the war in Gaza. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=133.4s)]
*  Authorities are now working to authenticate what appears to be a manifesto he posted online, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  accusing Israel of genocide and discussing the use of political violence. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=143.96s)]
*  The White House says the killings are based on anti-Semitism that has no place in America. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=148.6s)]
*  The Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=153.32s)]
*  fullest extent of the law. Hatred has no place in the United States of America under President [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=157.88s)]
*  Donald Trump. Outside the Jewish Museum, a spontaneous vigil was held. How can we stand [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=164.76s)]
*  here like it's normal? In Israel, politicians are blaming what they call toxic anti-Semitism, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=170.76s)]
*  they say is being encouraged by world leaders who've called for Israel to end the war in Gaza. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=176.28s)]
*  I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Stammer, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=181.64s)]
*  when mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers, thank you, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  you're on the wrong side of justice, you're on the wrong side of humanity, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=191.88000000000002s)]
*  and you're on the wrong side of history. In New York, armed guards have been stationed [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=196.68s)]
*  outside this synagogue. In Washington, police say they believe the suspect was acting alone [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=202.44s)]
*  and there is no ongoing threat to the public. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  Now what you heard the Israeli Prime Minister referring to there was a joint statement that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=214.36s)]
*  came from Sir Keir Stammer, the French President and the Canadian Prime Minister earlier this week [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=218.68s)]
*  in which they called for Israel to stop its military action in Gaza saying the situation [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=223.0s)]
*  there was now intolerable and that the amount of aid that was getting in was utterly inadequate. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  Well number 10 today didn't want to comment directly on the criticism that was coming from [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=233.88s)]
*  Mr Netanyahu but they did point to a statement that Sir Keir had posted on X a little earlier [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=238.28s)]
*  in which he condemned this attack here in Washington and said that anti-Semitism is an [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=243.32s)]
*  evil that we must stamp out. The French Foreign Ministry have been a little more direct, they [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=247.88s)]
*  characterise that criticism from Mr Netanyahu as completely outrageous and completely unjustified. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhRHLhQkJvw&t=253.48s)]
