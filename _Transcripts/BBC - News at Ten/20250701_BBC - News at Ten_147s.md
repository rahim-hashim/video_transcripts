# BREAKING:  Jury reaches partial verdicts in Sean “Diddy” Combs trial | BBC News
**BBC - News at Ten:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM)
*  In the last few minutes, the jury in the sex trafficking trial of the music mogul Sean Diddy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=0.0s)]
*  Coombs has reached a partial verdict. Our correspondent John Sudworth is in New York. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=4.64s)]
*  Bring us right up to date, John. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=10.64s)]
*  Well, Jane, this is a massive moment in a trial that has lasted seven weeks, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=15.76s)]
*  involved more than 30 witnesses, and in the dock, of course, one of the music industry's most iconic [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=20.48s)]
*  and wealthy stars. At the heart of this case is the question about the true nature of a man who [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=28.4s)]
*  was once fated by American society, showered with music industry awards, and given the honorary key [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=37.84s)]
*  to this city just a little more than a year ago. This trial has shown a very different side to him, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=45.04s)]
*  abusive, controlling, and violent, aspects that the defense have not denied. The big question [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=51.92s)]
*  for the jury, though, is whether that behavior amounted to a criminal enterprise. At the heart [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=58.24s)]
*  of this case was a video released showing him violently assaulting his then-girlfriend, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=65.04s)]
*  Cassie Ventura, in a hotel room a few years ago after a so-called freak-off. The sex parties that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=70.64s)]
*  have been so discussed in this case, such a central part which lasted for days, involved large amounts [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=77.68s)]
*  of drugs and baby oil provided by his assistants and which the prosecution say involved the coercion [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=84.8s)]
*  of people like Cassie Ventura to take part in them. Now, the defense have said that although they do [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  not dispute that Mr. Combs has occasionally behaved very badly, all of those sex acts were [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=98.96s)]
*  consensual. Essentially, they say that domestic violence is not the same as the charges that have [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=104.96s)]
*  been leveled in this case, sex trafficking and racketeering. Now, what we've just heard, Jane, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=110.08s)]
*  is that the jury has reached a verdict on the sex trafficking charges, but they are yet unable to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=115.6s)]
*  reach a verdict on racketeering. It looks as if we're not going to hear that partial verdict tonight. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  They're going to be sent back out, but certainly this is huge news for Mr. Combs and his team. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=126.72s)]
*  They gathered in court looking very worried about this. He refused a plea deal, don't forget, at the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=131.84s)]
*  beginning of this trial, betting that the jury would side with him. We are very close to the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=136.88s)]
*  moment of knowing whether that bet has paid off. John Sudworth, thank you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NnXF2rwkYM&t=142.32s)]
