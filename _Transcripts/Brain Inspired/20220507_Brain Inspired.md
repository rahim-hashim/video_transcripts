# BI 135 Elena Galea: The Stars of the Brain
**Brain Inspired:** [May 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-in-Wy7CvY)
*  The problem of the astrocyte field is trying to prove that astrocytes are like neurons.
*  But now I think the time has arrived to think that astrocytes are not like neurons.
*  The conceptual breakthrough was the understanding that those calcium responses in astrocytes
*  were equivalent to action potential in neurons in the sense that astrocytes respond very precisely
*  to neural information by way of calcium transients.
*  The term CLIA has protected the CLIA field and it has helped the CLIA researcher to get together
*  to organize their own meetings and their own journals. That has worked for a while. I mean
*  that has helped us produce data but now it's a highly damaging term.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  That was the voice of Elena Galea, a research professor running her lab at Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona.
*  Hi everyone, I'm Paul. So when I say brain, if you're like me and the majority of neuroscientists,
*  you automatically think of neurons. After all, since the early days of being able to record action
*  potentials from neurons, a ton of research has focused on how patterns of action potentials
*  in single neurons and in populations of neurons relate to our cognitive functions and behaviors.
*  And of course the deep learning models in modern AI are based on the idea that we can build
*  intelligence by performing distributed computations among neuron-like units.
*  But neurons aren't the only game in town in the brain. For example, there are many different types
*  of glial cells, which is basically the name given to the plethora of cells that are not neurons in
*  the brain. Our understanding of glial cell function lags that of neuron function because, as you'll
*  hear Elena say, the technology for recording certain types of glial cell activity didn't show
*  up until 40 years after we were already recording neurons. One of those types of glial cells are
*  astrocytes. I say one, but there are a handful of different types of astrocytes. And what we have
*  understood about astrocytes is that they help metabolism, they clear out chemicals that are
*  important for signaling between neurons, and other housekeeping-like roles, as Elena calls it. And
*  while that remains true, a lot of researchers are starting to ask whether astrocytes might also play
*  a role in the computations underlying our cognition. And now that we can record how they
*  signal amongst themselves and to and from neurons, we're beginning to appreciate how they may also
*  shape our cognition more deeply than traditionally thought. So that's what we discuss in this episode.
*  Elena elaborates on the old story about astrocytes, the new emerging story, Elena's current favorite
*  hypothesis that astrocytes play a key role in feedback control, sort of along the lines that
*  Henry Yen talked about as an important brain principle in episode 119. And we talk about the
*  future of astrocyte research, something Elena is calling computational astro-science. We talk about
*  astrocytes' emerging appreciation in disease states like Alzheimer's, and how we should stop
*  trying to make astrocytes seem more like neurons and let them just be themselves. One last thing
*  here before we start. After we recorded, Elena reflected a little bit and sent me this audio clip
*  about how she thinks if you're interested in astrocytes and their role in cognition,
*  how you might go about studying them. If someone wants to enter the astrocyte field to study the
*  role of astrocytes and cognition, I would recommend this person to avoid the glia field, to avoid glia
*  journals, glia meetings, even glia colleagues, and join a computational neuroscience group where he
*  or she can grow as a computational astro-scientist. Show notes are at braininspired.co.
*  slash podcast slash 135. Thank you for listening. Enjoy.
*  So Elena, welcome. Thanks for finally coming on. We've had to go back and forth a little
*  bit to get you on the podcast, but I'm glad you're here now. Yes. Well, thank you very much for having
*  me and the possibility to share my science with people. So neuroscience, the study of the brain,
*  neuro means neuron, right? Because that's really the only important thing in brains, isn't it?
*  Yes. So, but seriously, neuroscience has been and well continues to be very neuron-centric.
*  It is. You know, the seed of consciousness through all the computational aspects
*  and glia, well, among all the glia, which means traditionally, which means etymologically glue,
*  have been an afterthought, right? And we're going to talk specifically mostly about astrocytes here,
*  but I just want to say glia in general, because astrocytes are not the only glial cells. So can
*  you describe what the traditional old story is about astrocytes and you can throw in other glia
*  if you want and their functions within the brain? Right. The traditional view of the astrocytes
*  beyond being glue, which I think even people start the articles with the notion that they used to be
*  called glue and they're not glue any longer, glia cells in general. But the traditional view and
*  still true of astrocytes is that they perform housekeeping in the brain, unlike neurons,
*  which are the cells that encode basically, and they are responsible for higher brain functions.
*  Now astrocytes carry basic functions such as certain molecules released by neurons upon
*  activation, such as potassium and glutamate. Astrocytes participate in the re-removable
*  during sleep. This is a very important function that was discovered five years ago. Astrocytes
*  also control the flux of waste molecules out of the brain. And astrocytes are well adapted
*  morphologically to the function of molecule removal because they are like sponges that surround
*  neurons and all their neurons. And I want to emphasize architecture. I will mention architecture
*  during this conversation because the name of astrocytes that means stars, it came from
*  immune stain of astrocytes with GFAP. This is a cytoskeleton protein and it's like the humans are
*  a skeleton for cells and you only see like 10-20% of the cell and it has a star shape with a little
*  body and then some processes. But the astrocytes are not like that. That's only the skeleton.
*  Astrocytes are bushy, are round, they're very big and their distal processes are highly divided
*  to adapt to all the neuronal elements, spine, sacs and some bodies. So this is architecture.
*  And the functions, the traditional view in the last say 50 years is housekeeping. And this is true.
*  So they perform housekeeping and housekeeping is not a minor function. We have to say if they only
*  did housekeeping, that's okay. Now the question is whether they do something else with it to
*  computation. And that's the new story. So if in addition to performing basic functions,
*  the astrocytes are part of neural circuits and whether in neural circuits they shape the
*  processing of information among neurons beyond eliminating palpation and glutamate. That's the
*  question. We say in our jargon whether astrocytes are building blocks of neural circuits. That's the
*  new story about astrocytes.
*  RG Well, building blocks of neural circuitry sounds like architecture, but-
*  FG It is architecture, yes.
*  RG Okay, well, we'll get into some of their computational roles also later because they're
*  also being appreciated more and more as being part of the computations underlying our cognition, right?
*  FG No, not for now. It's still a hypothesis. So while right, no, it doesn't. This is what we're
*  really working on. So I can give a little bit of a historical background as to how we came to think
*  that astrocytes could be mobilizing and regulating cognition in addition to performing on static
*  functions. So probably, you know, and the listeners know that any discovery is based upon
*  new technologies and new conceptual developments. And the conceptual breakthrough in the 19s was
*  calcium imaging, which is the capacity to track calcium activity in astrocytes with a microscope
*  using fluorescent probes. That was in 1991. I actually, I started to do my postdoc in New York
*  at the time. So I lived through that very exciting time.
*  RG Were you already, sorry, I wanted to ask you about how you got interested in these things in
*  the first place. So-
*  FG Accidentally, accidentally, because I went to New York City to do a postdoc on vascular cells
*  in stroke and revolution of vascular dynamics in hypoxia and different traumas. And someone in the
*  lab, I was in the department of neurobiology in Cornell University. The director was the late
*  Donald Reese. And there, there was a very young assistant professor called Douglas Feinstein,
*  who was working on astrocytes. And John told me if I wanted to work with him,
*  and I could work in his lab because Douglas was starting a group in astrocytes. And I said,
*  why not? So I knew nothing about astrocytes. It was just a matter of luck. And we started together
*  working on astrocytes. And there was the time when astrocytes, nothing about the functional role of
*  astrocytes regarding cognition or neural circuits was mentioned or known, or even conceived. And
*  astrocytes were removing the passion, removing glutamate, that was known. And it was the time
*  where the concept of neuroinflammation started. And later we have a chance, I will tell you what
*  I think about the information, neuroinflammation now, which is not actually, I don't have a good
*  opinion of the term any longer. But that was the time when astrocytes and microglia were involved
*  in diseases, in Alzheimer's disease and in multiple sclerosis. So it was there. And so it happened
*  that it was working with a person that knew how to grow astrocytes in culture. That was a very
*  important technical development as well, to be able to grow astrocytes in cultures to study them.
*  And this is how it happened. So I didn't, it wasn't a vocational, it wasn't like I knew what
*  I was doing. You weren't following your passion, for instance, right? No, well, I am a very
*  intellectual person. And I'm a very curious person. And they happened, I started to work in neuroscience
*  because there was a thesis position, I was a fellowship that I could get to work in a loving
*  Spain that studied the vascular cells in the brain and in genealogy, neurophysiology. And I
*  was happy with that. But it's not that I looked great. But now I love the field. So I love
*  astrocytes. It's an amazing field to be in neuroscience. We have a lot of work to do in this
*  century. So I'm fine. I'm fine with it. It's like I was very lucky, serendipitously,
*  that I went into this field, I cannot tell stories that I was highly visionary,
*  I wanted to go into this field. I think those are bullshit in general, with exceptions, probably.
*  But hey, I'm very happy. I love science and my enthusiasm for things cerebral
*  haven't diminished. Is it fair to say that because you mentioned like Alzheimer's,
*  and I know you still work on the role of astrocytes in Alzheimer's. Was that also,
*  was disease an interest also? Or did that? Yes, yes. Oh, yes, I was because I studied
*  biology, but always I doubted when I finished high school, I didn't know if I could, I would
*  become a medical doctor or a physician or a or study biology because I got this course, the marks
*  ticket both in medical school and in the in the graduate school for biology. And finally,
*  I decided biology, I'm not sure why, but I decided biology, but I was always interested in this.
*  So eventually, I'm coming back to diseases through astrocytes, and it's a good position to be because
*  we need to know the basic function of a cell, you know, to understand what happens when they get sick,
*  and vice versa. Sometimes, when cells get sick, or when the brain is altering diseases, we learn a lot
*  of how it works during healthy, healthy situations. So I think I'm happy in combining both
*  computational astrocytes and really clinical research. I combine both fields very well.
*  And I think I should do it. Okay, so what you were saying about the advent of some calcium imaging.
*  Yeah, so in the 90s, we have calcium energy. And then the in the conceptual breakthrough
*  was the understanding that those calcium responses in astrocytes were equivalent to
*  action potential neurons in the sense that astrocytes respond very precisely to neural
*  information by way of calcium transients. So we say that neurons are excitable using changes
*  in membrane potential that produce action potentials, while astrocytes are excitable
*  using changes in calcium concentration. So this is the way we see the calcium transients in
*  astrocytes. Now, it's very important to understand the historical development of a given notion to
*  understand why research in a given cell type like astrocytes may be delayed over time. Neurons,
*  we know that neurons conduct electrical impulses from the 50s, from the 1950s in the 20th century,
*  when action potentials were discovered. And calcium imaging astrocytes appear 40 years later.
*  So research in astrocytes as possible excitable elements in circles is the life 40 years will
*  respect neurons. And this can explain in part why astrocytes and the role of astrocytes in
*  cognition is rather undeveloped as compared to neurons because time is a very important
*  factor in research. I think people outside research don't realize that research is an
*  artisanal work done with our hands and it takes a long time, not only to develop a mature concept,
*  but also to gather enough data to support a new conceptual change. So this is the time when
*  calcium imaging was possible in astrocytes is actually relatively recent with respect to the,
*  as compared to the discovery of action potentials in neurons. So that explains in part
*  why astrocytes and cognition haven't been related for a long time.
*  So just stepping back and reflecting for a moment, I mean, that story kind of
*  makes me think of two things. One, it's that the phrase, you know, when you're a hammer,
*  everything looks like a nail. And the other is the old story about someone who lost their keys
*  and the only place they look is under the light, right? Because it's the only place that they can
*  see. So in some sense, we haven't appreciated astrocytes because we didn't have the technology,
*  the calcium imaging technology. But the other way to look at that is that, so just like thinking
*  about neurons only as spiking things, because that's what we could measure. Now, is there a
*  danger that we think of astrocytes as calcium signaling entities because that's what we can
*  measure and we don't, you know, maybe we don't appreciate both neurons and astrocytes, other
*  facets, simply because we don't have the technology to measure those things yet.
*  Yes, absolutely. This is absolutely correct. This is absolutely correct.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah. And this is why it's very important to, we have to develop theory at the same time as
*  technology. Both things have to go hand in hand. But sometimes even you may have a very amazing
*  technology. As you say, you only look under the light. Exactly. You just don't see anything else.
*  But sometimes it's also that the technology is just, it doesn't allow you to detect anything
*  because with microscopes it's the same thing. And now we have amazing microscopes that allow
*  us to see the interaction between organelles live. We have one single nucleus RNA-C to do
*  high throughput molecular analysis. So they both go hand in hand, the conceptual development
*  and the technical development. And we need to understand that. We need to teach students and
*  we need to tell students that a given moment in science is determined by the concepts and the
*  technology that are available at the time. So you're not totally objective. You actually
*  depend on what you have. And you have to work with that and you have to move it forward. But
*  you have to realize that your influence is highly determined by the time you're doing your research.
*  You just mentioned that the advent of calcium signaling and imaging has brought to the fore
*  a larger role for astrocytes. And we'll go deeper into that, but just some more basics
*  about astrocytes in general before we get into what's being learned more about them. But
*  one thing in comparison relative to neurons, the god of the brain. So there are lots and lots of
*  different types of neurons and a lot of this is being learned through the high throughput
*  molecular techniques like you talked about. I think it's over a hundred and counting and we
*  don't even know how many exact types of neurons there are, but there are very few types of
*  astrocytes in the brain. And one way to think about that is that must mean that they have limited
*  roles, right? That they're mostly housekeeping. Is that the right way to think about it? What does
*  it suggest? I totally agree with you. This is a great question and issue to discuss.
*  It is a very important question because I've talked about fats. One of the current fats
*  in astrocytes or in brain research is the data obtained with single nucleus and single cell
*  RNA-seq and that has brought up the notion of astrocyte heterogeneity. And this is now a very
*  fashionable topic to the point that some authors contend that astrocytes are so heterogeneous
*  that there are no typical astrocytes. And this is wrong. Single nucleus RNA-seq is a great advance.
*  I agree with it because it improves the cellular resolution of molecular data, but we need to put
*  the concept of astrocyte heterogeneity perspective as you just did comparing
*  heterogeneity neurons with heterogeneity in astrocytes. And in short, there are thousands
*  of different types of neurons, molecularly distinct and functionally distinct neurons.
*  And there are less than 10 molecularly distinct astrocytes. And moreover, we still don't know
*  if those types that have been discovered recently are fake types that come from different progenitors
*  or if they are transient types that results from adaptation to local circuits. I support the
*  second possibility because I think that astrocytes are very plastic and they sort of adopt the flavor
*  of the circuits they serve. But yes, I agree with you. There are fewer astrocytes than neurons,
*  and this means that neurons are specialized to perform specific functions while astrocytes perform
*  general functions, be them homesthetic or computational, but fewer and general functions.
*  That's my idea, but I think people don't agree with me in that. So let's see if time will prove
*  that who is right and astrocytes are actually their genius and do 2,000 things or they just
*  do a couple of things. Well, like you said, there's a lot of work to do.
*  A lot of work to do. You said you kind of supporting the
*  latter view, you see astrocytes taking the flavor sort of developmentally and
*  plastically taking the flavor of the circuits that they're involved in. But the other people,
*  I don't know if you've read, I think it's Andrew Kub's book, The Root of Thought. There are people
*  who are very pro, who advocate the primacy of astrocytes that instead of taking the flavor
*  of the circuit, they're dictating the flavor of the circuit. How do you see this as a back and
*  forth process or are astrocytes taking the lead or astrocytes listening more and adapting their
*  function? I do think that neurons take the lead and astrocytes listen and if they compute, we
*  can just get into the computational part of astrocytes. I think if they compute, they adapt
*  to neurons. I think neurons, finally, they are, I wouldn't say the god of the brain,
*  that they are the ones that encode information and astrocytes may modulate. This is my theory.
*  Now we can just talk about hypothesis. So we don't know yet what they're doing. I can tell you
*  what are the data we have and what are the different options from that data.
*  We spoke already about the architecture and this is very important. Astrocytes are not like neurons.
*  They are huge and each given astrocyte has, includes in their body, includes like 10 neurons,
*  millions of synapses and thousands of dendrites. So they are sort of like a unit. This is very
*  important to understand and we still don't know what does it mean. If this reflects that astrocytes
*  are able to integrate some information from all those neurons or it's just some, that kind of
*  design has some type of advantage that we don't know. Another feature of astrocytes is that they
*  are territorial. Neuros are highly promiscuous. They sort of make interactions with some
*  direction on spines while neurons, where astrocytes, the distal process of one astrocyte just
*  doesn't get into the territory of the distal process of another astrocyte and we still don't
*  know what it means either. And when it comes to functions, as I said, there is no evidence yet
*  that astrocytes encode any cognitive variable. So if the person just mentioned said that astrocytes
*  lead the process of information transfer, I don't think that this has been proven. What we have
*  learned in the last, take in the last 20 years, particularly because researchers have been using
*  tools with increased spatial and temporal resolution and have undertaken studies in complex
*  behaviors. This is very important. So we know, I would say three things just to summarize the field
*  in three key points. First, that astrocytes modulate the activity circles. That's well
*  demonstrated in different areas. That's almost like saying they're another housekeeping role for them,
*  right? I think I will get to that, but in that, but computational. Right, computational housekeeping
*  as opposed to metabolic housekeeping. Exactly. This is it. Poor astrocytes.
*  Thank you. Thank you for the, I'm writing that down. I like it. I don't know, but it sounds like
*  computational housekeeping. I like it. Thank you very much. Well, I will use it.
*  But then, because when you were talking about the housekeeping traditional story, I kept thinking of
*  that's the traditional role of women in the United States, right? In Western culture.
*  And now we've come to appreciate or give more respect to women and their computational role,
*  right? That's a terrible analogy. But now you're saying they're housekeepers again.
*  Well, I don't think there is an active housekeeping. It's very important as well.
*  The point with housekeeping is that it should be regarded as an important function in general,
*  meaning that it should be economically interesting and men should be encouraged
*  to do housekeeping. That's my vision of housekeeping. I think it's an important
*  word like taking care of kids and taking care of all people. So I think the point is just to
*  give importance to housekeeping. And in the rain, it's the same thing. Just let's give importance to
*  housekeeping by any type of cell. I agree. So yeah, so they're mandatory in all types of circus,
*  in all different in all regions of the brain. That's well demonstrated. And if someone wants
*  to know the literature, just contact me, because I can forward them to really beautiful studies.
*  The second point that has been discovered in the last decade is that the culture responses in
*  astrocytes is quicly mirror the neuronal activity to the point that they are it is predicted.
*  And this means that one can tell the behavior of a mouse in general, an animal rat or a mouse,
*  very precisely just by looking at causing transients in astrocytes and using decoders.
*  This is another advance that we have been using tools that have been developed for neurons. Now
*  we're using them for astrocytes and using decoders with calls and activity, we can now predict what
*  kind of decision an animal has taken, or whether the animal's thirsty or whether the animal is
*  supposed to see has moved a position. How do those predictions compare to predictions based
*  on spiking, right decoded predictions? Equivalent. They're equivalent. Yes. So this is very,
*  very important now. And now with optogenetics and chemogenetics, which is the latest development
*  in neuroscience, when we manipulate astrocytes, we change behavior as proven to, which further
*  supports that astrocytes are part of circuits. And we can talk about the problem of optogenetics
*  and chemogenetics that are not very physiological. In fact, we really don't know how they work.
*  And we have to be very careful to use these tools to draw important conclusions, but
*  this is a fact. So we manipulate the astrocytes and we change behavior now. So the point is now
*  to ask the question, what does it mean? And in the astrocyte field, we think either this means
*  really sophisticated metabolic housekeeping. For instance, that upon calcium increases,
*  astrocytes release lactate to restore the metabolism neurons or astrocytes connect
*  the vascular, the blood flow to neuronal activity in order to provide more glucose and oxygen
*  to neurons or whether the astrocytes are activated to remove potassium and bring potassium
*  to other area of the brain. So the increase in calcium means that the astrocytes are
*  highly attuned to neurons, but that doesn't prove whether they compute or whether they just do
*  highly sophisticated housekeeping. And the question is, we are talking about computation,
*  is either whether they do store information themselves, do they extract neurons, do they
*  transmit information to neurons as one possibility? Or secondly, whether even if they don't store
*  information themselves about, they don't store the code part of the variables of the other brain
*  code, if they modulate the activity of the circus, like for instance, controlling excitatory
*  and inhibitory balance, controlling gain, providing feedback. And I think for me,
*  this is where the field stands now. And this is the work we need to do in the next decade.
*  Let's try to find exactly what are the astrocytes doing in the circuits and whether it's
*  homesthetic housekeeping that I like or homesthetic computation or computational
*  homestasis that is basic, which is myself the hypothesis I favor because as we mentioned,
*  astrocytes are sort of basic, they're not specialized. So probably they're doing the same
*  thing all over their brain. And then the engineers have to describe many basic functions that are
*  necessary in circles and astrocytes could be doing those functions, or whether they're really more
*  sophisticated and they're really encode for some type of variable like they control error, for
*  instance, when you're on fire differently, that some something has to put all the data together,
*  perhaps there's some computing there ever, or they're doing something that is more
*  like coding for a given variable, we still don't know that. And my recommendation for the field
*  is just not to push things because the problem of the astrocyte field, I think in the last 20 years,
*  is try to prove that astrocytes are like errors. And this has been like the motivation of all the
*  studies. So let's prove that astrocytes are very important in neural circuits. And this is fine
*  because it has produced under this framework, we have very interesting studies showing that
*  astrocytes can modulate circuit activity in a very fine manner. But now I think the time has arrived
*  to think that astrocytes are not like neurons. So we have to understand what they do, and what are
*  their very specific values that astrocytes compare to neurons that are slow. So calcium signaling,
*  the time range is seconds or hundreds of milliseconds on second, while neurons,
*  the action potentials work in milliseconds. Sometimes ultra fast action potentials are
*  less than one millisecond. So they're in different time zones.
*  Well, even in a comparison like that, right? So I was going to ask you about the timing of the
*  signals. And you just said that astrocytes are slower, but that's relative to neurons.
*  So it's hard to escape a comparison to neurons since they're sort of the standard of what's
*  important. Right. But we're just fine too, because we learn a lot from comparing things.
*  But I think that we have been forcing astrocytes to look like neurons. So people have been like,
*  once we described, we found calcium signaling astrocytes, people were trying to prove that
*  calcium signaling can be very fast. And they were developing increasingly more, more sensitive tools,
*  imaging tools to detect signaling in milliseconds or in 50 milliseconds. I think this is wrong.
*  This is wrong, because we have to think what kind of activities are important in the brain
*  in the second scale. And there are very many. So the brain works in many different time scales,
*  not only milliseconds. So we really have to refine our thinking without forcing astrocytes
*  into being something that they are not. And the time that of their responses is highly,
*  very important. And my, my impression now, my current hypothesis is that what they exercise to,
*  so their, their, their computational homostasis is to control feedback. So they, and I have one
*  article that I can, I recommend the you and the listeners to read by Hannah Ilsema. She's in the
*  Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at UCSF. And it's called, it's published in Cell,
*  in the two, in last year in 2021. And it's called biological feedback control, respect
*  the loops. And he, she contains that organisms are an evolutionary masterpiece of multi-scale
*  feedback control. And I think we should think about the brain also as a evolutionary masterpiece
*  of multi-scale feedback control. And my idea is that astrocytes participate in feedback loops,
*  at a micro and mesoscale working in the second range. And this is the way they may be central to,
*  to computational housekeeping. So it's not that they code variables, it's that they, they control,
*  they participate in feedback control. And we need to develop this idea and find what are the exact
*  principles and feedback loops that are relevant in the brain. And that astrocytes may be,
*  may be involved in.
*  Well, I'm going to have Matthew Larkham on the podcast soon. And one of the things that he
*  has been working on a lot is in the cortical, in the cortex, the cortical,
*  many circuits, the cortical column that there are in the upper layers. So let's say a layer five
*  pyramidal neuron has this long apical dendrite that reaches up into layer one. And that largely
*  receives feedback signals, whereas there's a more localized dendritic branching tree closer to the
*  soma that shoots down essentially a little bit below the soma. But that largely gets like bottom
*  up signals, like incoming signals. So you're describing that role for astrocytes made me
*  think of this because one of the things that he's shown is that the apical dendrites, when they're
*  those signals that they're getting the feedback are electrically decoupled from the cell body.
*  So they have like a very different role. So it would be very, it'd be interesting if astrocytes
*  had a role in meeting, mediating that feedback, but, but that's a little bit adjacent to the kind
*  of feedback control that you're, that you're talking about, I suppose.
*  Yes, yes. So it's a given circuit, they may be maintaining the, we don't know, this is a very
*  important thing to just isolate and identify what are the relevant circuits, whether it is
*  one given astrocyte and the same astrocyte is like a mini circuit that includes several neurons,
*  perhaps in quarters that has been described. And actually quarters, astrocytes are different in
*  different layers. So perhaps they engage in different feedback control with different neurons.
*  But I think it's very important to isolate the relevant circuit and try to analyze astrocytes
*  as elements that provide feedback. They don't process information themselves, although this
*  has to be proven or disproven, but that they provide feedback and that feedback control
*  allows for a finer performance of the whole circuit. That's the way I see it now.
*  Well, even homeostatic mechanisms are becoming, you know, even if that's a homeostatic role,
*  homeostasis-
*  It is homeostatic, but it's, yeah, it is homeostatic and there's nothing wrong with it.
*  Nothing wrong with that.
*  Right. Nothing wrong with it. And we should really be very humble. We don't need,
*  astrocytes don't need to be like neurons. So yeah, if they don't do it, that's fine too.
*  And if they, if the role is to do feedback control in the brain, that's their homeostatic
*  role in computation, that's fine too. And that's very, very important to find that as well.
*  Before we move on, I keep having this question float through my head. I want to ask you about
*  your general outlook or overview on the computational approach to thinking about cognition
*  that dominates neuroscience these days, that it's, we need to think about neural activity
*  all in terms of the computations being performed, whether that's in a population of neurons or in
*  small circuits or at the single neuron level and things like a feedback control mechanism,
*  like a homeostatic, I just said mechanism, you know, role, feedback role for astrocytes.
*  Even that we kind of think of in terms of how it relates to the computational function of neurons,
*  which is the quote unquote important thing, right? And I know what you're saying is that
*  it's all important, but do you have a perspective on how you think about our cognition? Is it all
*  computational? Is it multi-scale, multi-level that we need to somehow rejigger our thinking about
*  how to think about cognition? Well, I think it's the big question for this century, how exactly
*  the brain computes, whether the brain is digital or is more analogic. And certainly it's multi-level,
*  so that we know, and multi-scale. But the question is to identify what is the relevant
*  levels? Because I think we are generating a lot of data that happens in general in all the
*  biology fields, not only neuroscience, with all these new machines that we have and microscopes
*  and, and molecular analysis, we are generating a lot of data and I'm not sure we are really,
*  we're really developing knowledge very much. We are sort of have new toys and I'm not sure
*  we are using them correctly to generate new knowledge. It's giving jobs to many people,
*  and it's paying paychecks, but it will be great if in addition to paying, to paying salaries,
*  we could just actually advance knowledge in a meaningful manner. So I think this is the question
*  in the future is, what are the general principles that drive cognition and higher brain functions
*  and probably there are not very many. And also, of course, the brain code, we still,
*  there are some variables that we know that the brain computes, like colors or notes or
*  categories like being a dog or a tree or emotions, but we still don't know how the brain does it.
*  And what, and that's the tip of the iceberg, there are probably very many variables that the brain
*  computes and we are not aware of. And that's the job to do, that's our task to understand those,
*  those things in the next, I would say century, I would say in the 21st century. And in, when it
*  comes to astrocytes, I think that astrocytes can do something for, for computational neuroscience,
*  it is to help understand the brain better. This is exactly using the, the importance of feedback
*  control. So we may understand why brain does certain things. So studying astrocytes doesn't
*  remove or diminish the importance of neurons, it just enhances how neurons can be modulated,
*  because we introduce another element that brings feedback control. I mentioned that,
*  and also something very important, energy efficiency. One of the main features and amazing
*  features of the brain that hasn't been reproduced in artificial neural circuits is energy
*  efficiency. So the brain uses like 12 to 20 joules per second, which is like the energy that, that
*  a light bulb in a refrigerator uses. And it's not known why the brain is so energetically efficient.
*  And in all these more functional designs that are now being developed very actively, you know,
*  that you're really reproduce the brain circuits in a realistic manner. This is a main question. So
*  why, why is it that the, the, the brain manages to do so many things with very little energy?
*  And perhaps other non-neuronal cells, astrocytes, or perhaps NG2 cells, other types of glial cells,
*  are the ones that, that account for the energy efficiency, perhaps the, the architectural design
*  of astrocytes and neurons response to a way to make neural activity more sustainable using a
*  modern term. And this is the kind of things that you, that astrocytes and non-neuronal cells
*  can be used to understand because until now, we still, we don't understand why the neurons
*  can really perform highly demanding functions from an energetic point of view. With using neurons,
*  we cannot understand that. There are some theories like the sparse coding and other theories,
*  but perhaps we can introduce another element, which are astrocytes, for example. So perhaps
*  all that feedback control, the main goal and the main evolutionary goal has been to reduce
*  the, the use of energy or to make the use of energy in the brain more, more efficient.
*  And this is, this is the kind of, this is an example of where using non-neuronal cells or,
*  or looking at other properties in cells that don't have spikes can be very useful to understand
*  the brain and to, and to develop artificial intelligence that has brain-like properties.
*  I want to ask you a little bit more about your thoughts on, I know that you're not an
*  artificial intelligence expert, but, but before I do that, I'm wondering, so as, as technology
*  advances, just like we started our conversation saying that astrocytes have not been appreciated
*  until the technology kind of caught up to be able to see the calcium signaling and see how there's,
*  you know, kind of signaling to each other. Where, where are we in, you know, the other thing with,
*  with neurons, right, is that we can go in and I can electrically stimulate a little small area
*  of the brain, although it's really like a large area in terms of how many neurons it's stimulating.
*  Like it's like, with a baseball bat or something, but, but we can stimulate and I've done this.
*  I've stimulated a part of the brain and made monkey's eyes moves, move, you know,
*  in certain directions. We can also put little drugs in to, to reduce or ablate the activity
*  of neurons, you know, you can use, so you can be very specific. What I'm getting at is I'm
*  wondering where we are technologically. Can I, can I define, can I look at like a little part
*  of the brain and then just silence astrocytes and see what that does to the cognition or where are
*  we in terms of being able to manipulate and stimulate, et cetera. In terms of manipulating
*  is optogenetics and chemogenetics. And that so far are activating astrocytes. I'm not sure if there
*  with optogenetics, you can also inhibit neuronal activity, but I don't think that there is an
*  optogenetic tool that inhibits as precise, but you can achieve it as precise using transgenic,
*  transgenic tools. So you can remove the, the, um, I, the calcium receptors and just
*  oblique all the calcium activity and responses. The problem with that is that it's not very refined.
*  So this is, I think the problem, the, the problem in the manipulation of astrocytes is that it's not,
*  it's not very precise and it's not military. So it's just all or nothing.
*  There are stimuli, it's a lot and probably releasing with chemogenetics and optogenetics,
*  a lot of put a mate that the astrocyte never releases so much, or it just blocks completely
*  the, the calcium response of astrocytes. And that is not very, it's actually very good because we,
*  we see that things happen, but it's not very, very elegant. I'm, I'm not sure with neurons,
*  we can do a little bit better, but with astrocytes, we need to refine the temporal and the, and the
*  amount of signal that we induce or we, we manipulate. This is very, very important.
*  Also the regional activation, astrocytes are huge. So it's not the same to, to activate the whole
*  astrocyte as to activate a, a difficult process or a quarter of an astrocyte because the probably
*  different areas that are activity in different times and with different intensities have
*  different functional repercussions. So that's a problem. We need to be, to refine the,
*  the manipulation of the astrocytes. And when you mentioned the behavior, that's also very important
*  that we, now there are a few studies that have done it. We need to pair
*  strictly astrocyte activation with a given behavioral output at the same time, in order to,
*  to really determine whether astrocytes can modulate that behavior. This is difficult
*  to experimentally, but this is very, very important. You know, that too much astrocyte activity
*  with behavior. When it comes to recording, calcium is still the, the, the calcium imaging is the
*  technique that we use and now can be done a high in temporal, high in temporal spatial resolution.
*  There are tools like AquaTool developed by Kira, Post Cancer that allows to extract the signals
*  from the astrocytes with a very, very relevant resolution, relevant to behavior.
*  So we, we have tools, but probably we need to refine the circuits. So we need to understand
*  what is the circuit whereupon astrocytes are really, are really active.
*  Like the wiring diagram in terms of-
*  The wiring diagram is very important and then we need to manipulate astrocytes better.
*  And so, because if, if their role is feedback control, by definition, feedback is, is modulation,
*  is there are very minor changes. We're talking changes at 10, 20%. So we need to go down to
*  the level of refinement in order to extract relevant data. And now, as I say, we are in the
*  all or nothing type of manipulations. So this is, and of course, modeling will help with that.
*  So we can, this is another problem of the astrocyte field, unlike the neuronal field,
*  is, is that there is no much modeling in the astrocyte field, which is modeling can help us to,
*  to change, to modulate astrocyte properties in very small amounts that are relevant to,
*  to the real brain. But the modeling is, is, is not as advanced as it is for neurons.
*  Another second problem with the modeling is that the theoreticians don't work with
*  experimental people, which is a big mistake because in computational neuroscience,
*  you have the, the wet science and you have also the computational neuroscientists working
*  together. And this is very important, like in physics, like you have the theoretical physics
*  and you have experimental physics, and then one produces ideas or the others test them and they
*  go and give feedback in, in, in astrocytes that doesn't exist. I would say it's still, it's still
*  pretty early on, even in neuroscience as well. There are more that's happening more, but it's
*  young still. More, but in astrocytes, we don't have that. And even the few people that do modeling,
*  then they, and even they use astrocyte-like elements in artificial intelligence.
*  They, when, that sounds very good, but when you read the studies, they have a different conception
*  of astrocytes. Well, right, because they have to like come up with a, let's invent a computation
*  that we think astrocytes might be doing, we'll add it in. Right, it's something, you know, we should
*  use an element there that's, that has the performance and some type of feedback, which is fine, as I said,
*  but then you can have inhibitory feedback. You can have positive feedback, depending, you can act,
*  the feedback can be at different levels. So they don't agree. So we need, now we actually,
*  here in, in SPiN, we're trying to, to launch the field of computational astrocytes. And,
*  and we will, and I want to invite the, the, the silicon researchers and the people that work in
*  artificial intelligence to help them standardize their concept and approaches. And they find,
*  when they say astrocyte-like, just, just decide what, what is astrocyte-like? And we should decide
*  on exactly when we introduce astrocyte-like elements in a circle, what are we talking about?
*  Because we are not, we don't agree on that very, very important point.
*  It's funny that, so, you know, like the, the foundations of artificial intelligence based on
*  neurons, you know, but of course, neurons spike and hardly anyone builds spiking neural networks.
*  It's all rate-based and like their little points for us as neurons.
*  Exactly.
*  They're not very, they're not very realistic. And some people have mentioned that this is a problem
*  because the, even the way they model neurons is not very realistic, not only because there are not
*  a spiking neurons, but also because neurons are also very complex and they're, they are
*  computational units in themselves because the, we, the, the model neurons as a, as a one element
*  there, when that element has spines, has dendrites, has axons, has somas, and each part, as you
*  mentioned with, now regarding the work of, of that person that is going to take a podcast,
*  one given neuron is also computational unit and integrates information from different parts.
*  And that is not modeled in our, in artificial intelligence or in artificial neural networks.
*  So they're not realistic at all.
*  Well, and yet I could say, but, but look how far AI and deep learning now has come
*  with modeling it without considering the varieties of neurons and why, why should I
*  consider astrocytes? What, is it just energy efficiency? Are they important for building
*  intelligence? Well, perhaps they don't, they don't encode. So they, they are not crucial,
*  but they are like, I think having a circuit that is efficient from the point of view of energy,
*  this is very important, I think. So it's like having perhaps like just, just
*  presenting an analogy in the body, perhaps it's like, that's just, I saw like the lungs
*  and the heart and the liver of, of, of the body. So, but the brain doesn't work if the heart
*  doesn't work or if the lungs don't work. So perhaps the same kind of analogy is housekeeping.
*  So it doesn't look very sophisticated, but, but as, as I said, when they want to do artificial
*  intelligence that really can mimic human intelligence, they, they can, they need,
*  one of the reasons they need to use very complex computational devices, huge and enormous,
*  and the brain does it in a very small device. There is some efficiency in the, in the both
*  the functional design of the brain and this architectural design of the brain,
*  probably is important in order to, to have in this kind of efficiency. And artificial intelligence
*  now in two, in 2021, still for the time being doesn't do it.
*  Elena, it's 20, it's 2022. We're in 2022. Oh, 2022. Sorry. In 2019. I'm still,
*  you know, with, with this coming, I'm a little bit lost time wise. I'm a little bit lost in 2022.
*  Yeah. Your housekeeping is all messed up. My housekeeping is terrible, but yeah, it is.
*  But yeah, I think that in order to be intelligent, perhaps, yeah, feedback control,
*  energy efficiency, and astrocytes may be relevant for that. And that for me, I, I am happy with that.
*  I'm happy with truth. So if we, we in computational astrocytes, eventually,
*  we find that astrocytes are not relevant for computational issues, that's fine too. I think
*  we have to be comfortable with that. But then, but perhaps in, in, in, in this century,
*  we'll find out that they, we find, we discover properties and principles of brain activity
*  that in which astrocytes are an essential element in regulating those circuits. So perhaps we will
*  describe that. Some people have said that astrocytes are some, there is a very interesting
*  researcher in Russia, Susana Gorlieva, who produces in silicone mold and of astrocytes. And I always
*  like to read her papers. Well, she says that astrocytes are the ones that make the brain
*  analogic. That neurons are only digital. And with that, we cannot have any intelligence
*  and astrocytes because perhaps they are, they are imperfect in providing feedback to neurons,
*  make neural circuits to behave in an analogic manner. So I think it's an interesting idea.
*  So yeah.
*  Just as an aside, what do you think of the hype of artificial intelligence these days?
*  Is it overhyped? Are you impressed by it? Are you, do you find it lacking? Or do you have any
*  thoughts on it? I mean, I'm impressed because actually I, as a tool to process information,
*  not just in the brain too, we do all mix, a lot of mix in the lab. And in addition to do ontology
*  and all this mining of data using platforms and then another statistical tools that we use,
*  we have used artificial intelligence to fill the gaps and to draw predictions and it works.
*  So I'm impressed. I'm impressed by the capacity of artificial intelligence to, to improve knowledge.
*  And we, and it's a little bit scary because we, we actually don't know how it does it because you
*  know, you know, the inputs and you know, the outputs, but you actually don't know what happens
*  there. But it's a fact and it's the, it is going, it's happening already.
*  And it will be the, in 500 years, it will be probably the, the way the humans will live
*  with artificial intelligence. Either human species still, still around.
*  Then I have a colleague who works in artificial intelligence that he, he thinks that artificial
*  and he's very optimistic about artificial intelligence. Sounds like it. I know what's
*  coming. Go ahead, say it. And he says that in the vision of humanity, that artificial intelligence
*  going to be much better than human intelligence and that the, the, the humans using artificial
*  intelligence, they're going to live in a better society. He thinks that and that he predicts that
*  let's say, I don't know, 500 years from now, 1000 years from now, the vision of, of the
*  20th century and the 21st century will be of the man that produced the artificial intelligence.
*  The man.
*  So now in the same way that we see all the 15th century was a Renaissance, 20th century
*  was of all the developments in physics and planchech mechanics. Then we will see the 21st
*  century was artificial intelligence. And his prediction is that it's going to be much better
*  and that artificial intelligence is going to work, is going to work much better than, than the brain
*  intelligence.
*  So the physics, let's say like the golden era of physics, right? In the 20th century,
*  that happened pretty quickly, but this is a 500 years is a lot slower. Is it just a harder problem
*  or why would it?
*  Oh, I will 500 years assist the number. I don't know because actually, yeah, it could be 200
*  years and we 100 years because actually what people tell me people that work in artificial
*  intelligence tell, tell me is that they, they are important developments like every week in
*  artificial intelligence.
*  Yeah. Well, well, well that, okay, quote unquote important. I'm not sure you have to judge what's
*  important.
*  Well relevant. So that they feel is very fast. It's moving. It's going very fast to the point that
*  they don't even bother to publish things. They have this big tree where they, they connect dots
*  and they, they, they show the data from different labs. And in that, and people say that is really
*  moving on very, very fast in all realms in, of course, for technology and for Google,
*  Facebook, and for the clinical research is moving very, very fast. So it's out there. It's out
*  there. I think we cannot stop it. At most we can control it and, and demand that it, that it should
*  be transparent, which doesn't say the problem is like, like the, like the brain, we don't really
*  know how it works. Artificial intelligence is exactly the same thing, but I am, I'm curious
*  about it and I think we can't stop it. And in my lab, we have used it to, to complement our manual
*  analysis. And I have to say that very successfully.
*  Well, I think a lot of young people are curious about it too. And a lot of people in academia,
*  I'm not sure if this, if we mentioned this during the episode or before when we were talking, but
*  people are, seem to be leaving academia in droves these days, or at least threatening to,
*  or complaining about, et cetera. Why would you, two questions. Why would you stay in neuroscience?
*  Why would you stay in academia or why would you go into neuroscience as opposed to going to work
*  for Google or some company that we can't stop because it's, they're producing so much data
*  and it's so important every week are as 10,000 new important things. So the second question would be
*  if I were to kind of go into computational neuroscience, why should I study astrocytes?
*  Should I study astrocytes? Is this the right time? You said, I think you said it's going to take a
*  hundred years until we fully know the- Well, but then you do, you will contribute to that
*  development. If you're, if you're a curious person, I think you can study computational
*  astrocytes and then just contribute to the development of the field. But one very important
*  thing is not to be isolated from the neuronal people, which is another problem and a big
*  problem of the glia field. And I'm actually against the use of the term glia because it is,
*  it has historically important term that was coined 100 years ago because there were researchers like
*  Cajal and others, they saw neurons that were obviously relevant to the performance of the
*  brain and other cells. And that's, that should be, and at that time it was the correct thinking,
*  but now that is too simplistic. And in the term glia has protected the glia field and it has helped
*  the glia researcher to get together to organize their own meetings and their own journals.
*  And we review each other and that has worked for a while. I mean, that has helped us to produce
*  data, but now it's a highly damaging term, I think, because what happens is that when neuronal people
*  take a look into astrocytes, they don't buy any of what we do. You have to make it sexier. You have
*  to make it... So they think that they are primitive cells and that research in neurons is highly more
*  relevant and there are priorities in neurons that need to be solved before we just ask questions
*  about whether these primitive huge cells are doing something in neural circuits. And that's a problem
*  because we need the neuronal people. We need their theories. We need their technical tools.
*  We need their statistical analysis and we need to grow together. And my intention with the
*  computational astrocytes field is just not to develop it in isolation with the neuro field,
*  but in Spain to grow it in the computational neuroscience field. And I think the students,
*  the question to go into is not a question to enter academia or to go into
*  Google. I think the question is whether you want to do research or do you want to do something else.
*  That's my question. And then you want to do research and because you're a curious person,
*  because you want to ask big questions and the brain neuroscience is still a big question,
*  or whether you want to solve diseases. And I think computational neuroscience and computational
*  astrocytes has the chance of curing diseases and perhaps not now, but in the next, I would say,
*  10 years. Because once we understand, for instance, the role of astrocytes in synchronization of
*  neurons, we can manipulate that precise in order to restore synchronization or we can engineer
*  neuronal circuits to adapt their activity in very fine ways and control
*  autism and schizophrenia. I think in 10 or 20 years, the neuronal computational neuroscience
*  can to deliver clinically relevant results. And if people, students, they want to cure diseases,
*  then do research to cure diseases. This is a fine field too. And they can do research in academia
*  and they can do research in companies as well. There are many companies now that do very,
*  very fine research. So I think the point is whether you want to do research and then where,
*  or whether you want to do something else with your biological degrees or medical degrees.
*  That's the question. But yeah, I think research is a magnificent endeavor and
*  it's very fulfilling in the long term. And it's never frustrating, right? Never frustrating.
*  It's always never frustrating. Never, ever. You say, anyone tells you they're research
*  frustrating? They're lying. So computational astro science is the term.
*  Yes, computational astro science that will work on homosetotic housekeeping.
*  But then that also, not to belabor this point, but then that also kind of keeps it separate from
*  computational neuroscience. I know that the phrase mirrors computational neuroscience, but
*  what would be a term, you wouldn't say neuro astro or astro neuro or?
*  Yeah, those are, yeah, we play with those terms and it's not easy. It's very, it's a hard one
*  because it's very, it's turns die hard and neuroscience will not die.
*  What about just systems? The problem is neuro is always in the world, right? Which focuses.
*  Neuros always in the world. That's the problem. But yeah, so that's, I don't know, we can perhaps.
*  Systems brain science.
*  Yeah, systems brain, but brain is the brain because the spinal, well, it's the peripheral
*  nervous system. It's also part of the brain and then the spinal cord is on the brain.
*  Systems, brains, the universe and everything science about.
*  Exactly. Neural things.
*  Let's end on this because it's kind of coming full circle. So even during our conversation,
*  so we live in an era where words have become, I don't know, more people put more.
*  Let's see, how do I say this? Words are sensitive to people now, right? They can trigger people,
*  they can be violent, et cetera. I, you know, even during our conversation, I have in the back of
*  my head talking about, you know, the sexism of what housekeeping has been traditionally,
*  blah, blah, blah. I have to be careful what I say and thinking about the term neuron and glia and
*  how to move forward and how things are named, quote unquote, incorrectly. Do words matter?
*  Do the names of things matter?
*  Yeah, the words, oh yes, there's the word that they do matter a lot because they shape our thinking.
*  Sometimes it's interesting, sometimes words that the linguists say that sometimes you need words
*  to be a little bit ambiguous because if it is very strict, then basically you don't communicate.
*  But yeah, but some other times you need words to be very precise and you need to,
*  and then you need words to convey the right concept. So words are strictly related to
*  conceptual refinement. So we need to refine our lexicon in order to refine our research as well.
*  And I think this is one of the reasons with neurons and astrocytes. And perhaps in the long term,
*  I already said we shouldn't use the term glia because this is like saying that the nature is
*  divided in water, air, fire. And I don't remember the fourth element, we should stop saying glia
*  because that is furs the resolution, the functional resolution of glial cells.
*  And perhaps we should stop saying neurons and astrocytes as well and describe the brain in
*  terms of circuits, relevant circuits and relevant functions that are, some of them we know,
*  and some of them are still to be discovered. So perhaps in 100 years, our vision of neuroscience
*  will be based on relevant circuits and relevant building blocks in that circuit instead of neurons
*  astrocytes because even we said that already, there are thousands of different types of,
*  many different types of neurons. And why should they be collapsed in the notion of a cell that
*  spikes? Well, 100 years is a long enough time, I think that that might happen because like people,
*  linguists would also say that words are difficult to change. That's not the way that language
*  really develops unless you are really good at making memes or something. And so it's hard to
*  force a change and somehow it has to happen over gradually over time and in a somewhat natural
*  manner. So I don't imagine that you think that you could force the change.
*  Well, yeah, it's very difficult. Usually the change comes because the people that use those
*  words retire. And this is like that. So new people come seen and they have different ways of
*  describing things. But we should really encourage people to use better words and to describe
*  systems in a more refined manner. Absolutely. And particularly as you say, it's like trying
*  to take it personally because the problem now that words are loaded, emotionally loaded,
*  and particularly in the United States and Europe, it's not like that yet.
*  You think it's coming?
*  It's coming. We are watching.
*  Don't stop watching us. Stop doing anything that we're doing.
*  We're watching, but I think you started crazy because words are just words. So we cannot just
*  be so continuously offended by certain words. I don't care. In the case of signs, I think that
*  we can describe things better. And in personal terms, I'm not offended at all by many words,
*  and I don't care. But I think that we really have to be a little... I don't know. This is the way
*  that the world is going. Sometimes it's a little excessive in this sort of overreaction to name
*  some words and getting offended by just basically anything that suggests another reflection.
*  Yeah. Maybe the world is going through a rough patch, but I've enjoyed... I think that our little
*  time here has been like an oasis within that rough patch. So I've...
*  Well, you can use any words with me. I don't care. You have time with me.
*  Oh, you better watch out. Don't get me going. So...
*  Okay.
