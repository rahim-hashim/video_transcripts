# BI 029 Paul Humphreys & Zac Irving: Emergence & Mind Wandering
**Brain Inspired:** [March 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOR48vgu0jY)
*  I think there's a particular reason why people haven't come to consensus on what
*  emergence is. Hey, the way that you've been thinking about a phenomenon is
*  problematic for all of these armchair reasons that I haven't done any work in
*  the lab, which I have since, but at that point I haven't done any work in the lab, I've
*  been sitting in a chair and I'm telling you that something in your research is
*  is wrong. Don't take this the wrong way, but I don't find humans very
*  interesting. Well, it's been nice talking to you guys. If my wife is going to listen to this, I'm in real trouble. But you see what I mean?
*  What are we doing? This is all so confused and terrible.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hey everyone, this is Paul Middlebrooks. Welcome to Brain Inspired. You just heard two philosophers,
*  Paul Humphreys and Zach Irving, both at the University of Virginia. I just realized that those little snippets at the beginning there may make them sound like pessimistic or angry philosophers, but it is quite the opposite.
*  You'll hear that they are both fine young men and a pleasure to chat with.
*  Paul has been philosophizing for quite some time now. He's written extensively on multiple topics in philosophy and the philosophy of science.
*  He's written entire books on emergence and on computational science, and he's the editor and a contributor to the Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Science.
*  Those are just a few samples of his works. And recently he has gotten interested in the philosophical issues related to artificial intelligence.
*  Zach is in the beginnings of his career, but he has dug deep into the philosophy and neuroscience of spontaneous thought and in particular the burgeoning study of mind wandering.
*  So today, in the first part of the show, we focus mainly on the science and philosophy of emergence and of mind wandering, touching on lots of fun topics like consciousness,
*  mindful meditation, the place of emergence and or mind wandering in AI systems and so on.
*  And later in the show, we talk more broadly about how philosophy fits among neuroscience and AI and how Paul and Zach view the current relationship between philosophy and science.
*  Sorry for spoiling the ending here, but the conclusion? We should all be friends and try to understand each other better.
*  I like that.
*  So I really enjoyed our discussion today, and I hope that you do as well.
*  In the show notes, I link to both Paul and Zach's websites, plus some of the papers and books that we talk about on the show.
*  And that is all, of course, at braininspired.co.slash podcast slash 29.
*  Want to say thanks today to Kamal, David, Bas, Mario, Estevallo and Tobias, all for supporting the show on Patreon.
*  You too can do that through the website at braininspired.co.
*  And I added a way a couple days ago to do it through PayPal as well, if that's a better option for you.
*  Although the PayPal button looks terrible on the website, but it'll do for now.
*  Anyway, I continue to feel super grateful and amazed that you guys value the show enough to contribute to it.
*  Thank you.
*  Many of you now have reached out to me to request guests and suggest topics.
*  I love hearing from you guys and hearing where you are in your journey.
*  So keep that up.
*  I have some guests lined up to address some of your requests, so you can look forward to that.
*  And feel free to contact me at paul at braininspired.co with suggestions for guests and or topics.
*  For now, please enjoy the philosophical and personal stylings of Paul Humphries and Zach Irving.
*  All right.
*  I have Paul Humphries and Zach Irving today.
*  Great to have you guys on the show.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  You're welcome.
*  Nice to be here.
*  So to maximize the time that we have, this can be a little bit different.
*  I'm going to do most of the introduction for you.
*  I will have done most of the introductions of both of you guys beforehand here because we have a lot to get to, it turns out.
*  Yes.
*  Now, this is the second time that I've had two people on the show.
*  I recently had Ioana Marinescu and Conrad Kurding on the show.
*  And it turned out I was able to help them through some tough marital issues.
*  And hopefully I can create that magic again today here.
*  So how long have you guys been married?
*  Not long enough.
*  A happy marriage is exactly one year, almost one year and two months.
*  Good.
*  Maybe the newlywed game today will go well then.
*  So what I do want to ask about, you guys are both involved in this group, the Human and Machine Intelligence Group at the University of Virginia.
*  And Paul, you're a co-director of this group and Zach, you're a faculty member.
*  And you want to just tell me how did this group come about and what do you guys do in the group?
*  Well, like most things, it came about because some money became available.
*  And once we got going, I mean, it really took off.
*  I mean, UVA is a place where talking to people in other departments is not as easy as it is in some other places.
*  So, you know, we've got people from philosophy, from computer science, from sociology, from architecture, from law school.
*  I mean, pretty much you name it, there's people participating in this from a number of different perspectives, which has really been interesting.
*  And I've really been heartened by how philosophy can engage with these different areas.
*  And does everyone on a rainy day, does everyone still make it to the meetings from so many different areas?
*  Well, we provide food.
*  Maybe I'll come.
*  Soup house.
*  Yes.
*  So what do you guys talk about and what do you guys do during the meetings and as a group?
*  Yeah, so we've a lot of discussions have been there have been talks where we engage in general discussions.
*  And there have also been some sort of breakout working groups that have focused one group on representation and the other group on ethical and normative issues to do with.
*  I think would be a sort of breakdown of how the groups work.
*  Yeah, so it naturally split into those two groups.
*  And as Zach said, most weeks we have a presentation from someone who specializes in an area.
*  We've occasionally tried to have discussions.
*  For example, this semester, we have people read the European Union ethics proposal.
*  I thought that was really going to engage people.
*  I guess people in computer science, they don't want to talk about this.
*  So discussion isn't really something that they want or are willing to do, which I was disappointed in.
*  Yeah, you know, because we're philosophers, you know, that's our game.
*  To be disappointed.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it sounds like a cool group.
*  So, OK, so as always, we have a lot to discuss today.
*  So it'll be a miracle if we get to it all, but we're going to definitely try here.
*  So much of what we're going to discuss is a role where philosophy, I think, thrives and can really help sort out,
*  you know, what the hell it is that we're actually trying to study in neuroscience and in artificial intelligence.
*  You know, it's also where some people become disillusioned, I'd say, with philosophy.
*  So I hope part of what comes out of this conversation today is just, you know, how and where philosophy fits alongside neuroscience and AI.
*  That being said, let's start out just getting frustrated here, OK?
*  So I had Melanie Mitchell was on the show a few weeks ago, and she's an expert in complexity science and artificial intelligence.
*  And complexity as a concept is hard to pin down, it turns out.
*  It's difficult to define.
*  There's not a single definition or a grand theory of complexity, but there are common features to complex systems.
*  And one of those features of a complex system is emergence.
*  And it turns out emergence as a concept is hard to pin down and hard to define.
*  But it too has sort of a cluster of common characteristics.
*  So, Paul, you've written a lot about emergence and your most recent book is called Emergence, a Philosophical Account.
*  So what is emergence and why is it not easily defined?
*  And I should say, you know, you both feel free to jump in and chime in whenever you have something to add as well.
*  Yeah, I like that analogy with definitions of complexity a lot because people know that there's an entire zoo of different definitions of computational complexity out there.
*  And each of them have motivations that you can justify, but it's hard to bring them all under one umbrella.
*  And the same thing with emergence.
*  And I think there's a particular reason why people haven't come to consensus on what emergence is.
*  The way I like to put it is that, you know, if you contrast it with causation, everybody will agree that certain core cases are cases of emergence, right?
*  So you have a rock hitting a window.
*  Sorry, causation.
*  So you have a rock hitting a window.
*  If you don't agree that there's a causal sequence going on there, you need to leave the room and not continue the discussion.
*  But there aren't core examples with emergence.
*  Different people, you know, coming from different areas, computation or biology or physics, philosophy, see different things as examples of emergence.
*  And not everybody agrees that they are actually examples.
*  So that's how you get different definitions of emergence.
*  Well, coming out.
*  Emerging.
*  Just go ahead and say it.
*  Emerging.
*  It's hard to avoid that.
*  Actually, one of the things you were reminding me of, I saw this really nice talk by Jim Wordward on sort of folk theories of causation last year.
*  And it's a lesson that I got from that talk.
*  I don't know if this is the lesson that Jim wanted to have from the talk, but this was my reading of Jim.
*  Was that one of the reasons why we get this sort of these more unified conceptions of causation are because humans evolved to track causes.
*  When you were apes 300,000 years ago that could track causal relations, did a whole lot better manipulating those causal relations and being able to effectively control their environment.
*  And then apes who couldn't.
*  And as such, we have so we can use those sort of folk concepts of causation that have evolved biologically and that also have evolved in culture as a sort of like grounds for starting to refine our philosophical notions.
*  Whereas I'm not sure that that's the case with abstract philosophical concepts like emergence or complexity.
*  Because emergence is undoubtedly weird and you don't run across uncontroversial cases of it in ordinary life.
*  That one of the great things that science has done is in many cases that initially seem emergent, you can formulate a reductive theory and explain it and it goes away.
*  So we're not acquainted with these things.
*  But to say something positive about this and address the other part of your question, I find a sixfold taxonomy of emergence useful.
*  And there's a broad division between what's called synchronic accounts in emergence, where the emergent phenomenon occurs at the same time as the things from which it emerges.
*  And then there's diachronic emergence in which the emergent phenomenon occurs later than the things from which it emerges.
*  Now in philosophy, the synchronic tradition has been dominant for a very long time.
*  And so when people talk about consciousness, they tend to think of people's conscious experiences as occurring at exactly the same time as whatever the brain processes are that give rise to it.
*  But over the development of the universe, there are interesting cases, for example, between the Big Bang and now, you have molecules appearing that weren't there close to the beginning.
*  Now, I think there's an important question as to whether it's legitimate to say that those molecules actually emerge from earlier states of the universe.
*  So that's an area in which diachronic emergence seems to be something that you need to pay attention to.
*  So that broad division, synchronic and diachronic, is one dimension.
*  The other dimension has three.
*  There's ontological emergence, which claims that there are out there in the world genuine examples of emergence.
*  They're not a product of our theory or conceptual framework.
*  The second position, which we can call epistemological emergence, is that some things, maybe in the area of computation, are sufficiently complex that we can't predict them in the way that you can predict things like eclipses of the sun.
*  So just to hold there for a second.
*  So ontology is the study of being, essentially.
*  When thinking about ontological emergence versus epistemological emergence, in ontological emergence, the emergence is real outside of even our conception of it, right?
*  And epistemological emergence, it is essentially that we don't have the, as humans, we don't have the tools to reduce it to its origins, right?
*  How would we be able to tell the difference between an epistemic and an ontological emergence, right?
*  Since by definition, we don't have the tools, as humans, to tell whether it's ontologically emergent or whether we just don't have the tools.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yeah, it does.
*  Assessing cases of ontological emergence is much harder than assessing epistemological emergence.
*  So let's go back to the complexity issue.
*  You can know that, in principle, a certain state of a system is predictable from your basic theory.
*  But for computational reasons, for example, it could be so complex that you can't do it in practice.
*  And so you've got there something that's epistemologically emergent but not ontologically emergent.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yeah, thanks. Sorry for the stoppage there.
*  I wonder also whether there are, so in cases of ontological, when you're trying to decide, is this emergence just merely epistemic or is it ontological?
*  I think that's where arguments like Jaegwon Kim's sort of taught on causation problems come in,
*  where you have these sort of general problems with ontological emergence,
*  where you sort of worry that they violate sort of basic principles of causation, like the causal closure of the physical,
*  which would make you think that the cases where report to the ontological emergence might just be epistemic,
*  because that creates a lot fewer problems elsewhere for ontology.
*  So there might be a default reason, at least in cases of synchronic emergence,
*  I would think, to think that the cases that we're finding empirically are epistemic and not ontological,
*  unless we have really, really good reasons to believe otherwise.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And so the third category is conceptual emergence,
*  where in order to recover effective predictability, you have to develop a new representational framework.
*  Ah, okay.
*  And then if you're fortunate, then you can go back to predicting things.
*  So that's the taxonomy that I find useful.
*  If you ran into a random philosopher, they would certainly disagree with this.
*  But as a working hypothesis, I think it's pretty good.
*  Well, I think that's super helpful.
*  I had Dean Buonamano on the show, and he's a neuroscientist,
*  and he studies the neuroscience of time,
*  which we really still don't understand how time gets encoded and represented in brains at the mesoscale, let's say.
*  But one of the things that he has done and others have done as well that I think is just a great start
*  is built a taxonomy and how important that is to set the foundation for creating a science
*  and then going and studying the actual phenomenon.
*  So I think it's a great foundation from which to build.
*  And then we can always argue about whether that foundation is right and how to continue.
*  But so before we move on, let's just talk about some of the common properties really quick that encompass emergence, right?
*  So I know one is that an emergent phenomenon, it needs to be novel.
*  Yes.
*  And there needs to be some holistic aspect to it.
*  I don't know if you want to maybe comment on that as well.
*  Yeah, I think novelty is one thing that pretty much everybody agrees on that emergent property has to have.
*  Historically, holism has been very important.
*  But think back to the distinction between dichronic and synchronic accounts.
*  Holism plays a central role usually in synchronic accounts.
*  It's far less obvious that you need that with synchronic accounts just because the considerations are different.
*  I mean, the novelty is going to come out of the previous states of the system.
*  But they could be non-holistic and just significantly different.
*  I could give you an example later on if you like.
*  So yeah, novelty is there. Holism is fine for synchronic, maybe not so fine for dichronic.
*  OK.
*  And another property is that it should be somewhat autonomous from its origins, right?
*  I think that's kind of embedded in the first two somewhat.
*  Can we introduce the elephant in the room of consciousness?
*  Yeah, no, OK.
*  Well, yeah, let's just go ahead because I was going to ask about consciousness because the first time that I heard the term emergence,
*  it was in respect to consciousness because this is the way that for just commonly it's thought of that as a way of explaining how our mind emerges from our brain processes is emergence.
*  That's what emergence is.
*  But there's a lot of other aspects that a lot of other ways in which emergence occurs.
*  But yes, let's talk about consciousness for a moment.
*  So I was going to ask Zach if he thinks that consciousness satisfies the autonomy, satisfies the autonomy condition.
*  So what do you need for an autonomy condition?
*  Well, usually it's that the autonomous, the immersion property has to be dependent in some way on the thing from which it emerges.
*  But it has to operate in whatever way you interpret that in a sense that is independent from the.
*  Right.
*  And so that sounds like it's going to fit best with causal emergence where you're saying that it's getting novel causal properties.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I think that there are really, really deep problems that arise that Jack Lunkim brought up in the 90s and Jessica Wilson that arise in the 90s.
*  Arise if you if you think that there's genuinely new causal properties being had by conscious experience, I could draw you a picture.
*  You draw it to me and then send it to me and I'll use it as the cover art.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So I so here's here's the the actually it's there's a bunch of different steps in the in the art.
*  But the sort of basic idea is that look, all the if consciousness is going to sort of emerge from the basal properties.
*  Right.
*  So like say consciousness emerges from what's going on in the brain.
*  Yeah. And and indeed is at some point going to emerge from what's going on in the micro physical properties of the brain.
*  Right.
*  So like the act.
*  Sure.
*  All the way down.
*  Reduce it all the way down.
*  Here's a really plausible general claim about physics.
*  That micro physical level is is closed.
*  Right.
*  Where so you have one conscious state, say an intention to go get an ice cream that's being caused by another conscious state.
*  Say your desire for an ice cream.
*  Right.
*  Both of those are going to are going to supervene on micro physical states.
*  But those micro physical states that the sort of the intention to go get an ice cream that's going to be caused exhaustively by the earlier micro physical states.
*  So if you're going to introduce and say that the conscious states have new causal powers and they're autonomous in this strong ontological sense, then the worry is that you're either going to get causal over determination.
*  Or you're going to violate where where there's the micro physical properties actually two causes from the consciousness and from the basal cause or you're going to get the not causal closure of the micro physical.
*  And that's a really problematic.
*  So there's an agenda.
*  Kim runs these options and says they're all big problems.
*  I think that these really are deep ontological problems that if you're an ontological, if you believe in ontological emergence, it's hard to see how you get around these problems.
*  I love this, first of all, because whenever I've asked the vast majority of people, neuroscientists, you know, and I start to bring up consciousness, they start to get itchy, you know, and roll their eyes.
*  Yeah, you do.
*  Well, yeah, I agree.
*  So could I just make my own position on the status of consciousness clear?
*  I think when one is discussing emergence, you should stay away from consciousness.
*  It might be emerging, seems like a plausible candidate, but we don't know anywhere near enough to to say it is or it isn't where there are clear examples lower down the scale of physics, chemistry, biology, where you've got much better reasons for thinking that certain kinds of phenomena are emerging.
*  I'm not sure that everybody would agree with that.
*  I disagree with you on the details.
*  I think I'm sort of in general agreement that I'm a little bit worried about the sort of general discussions of consciousness, but I do think that there are certain cases of conscious experiences where maybe we have a, or we're starting to get a sort of better worked out conception of how emergence might work.
*  So the case that we've talked about that I really like is flavor experiences.
*  So there's really cool cases where so you have this when you taste the balance of a wine, that's a property that matters in wine and that affects how we aesthetically evaluate it, how much it sells for.
*  One of the central potentially important properties of wine, I think that something like diachronic emergence might actually, but so that that player of balance in wine is coming from the sort of taste percept and the smell percept and even vision potentially and audition and touch.
*  This is massively multimodal experiences is this flavor percept that I think their psychologists and the nurse and who work on flavor argued that it's emerges from the sort of the single modalities.
*  I think that in this is one case where you might actually get a much nicer picture of how sort of unconscious experience can emerge from another experience.
*  I think it's a picture that might be diachronic emergence where you have these sort of individual percepts, right?
*  Like the like the the taste and the smells and stuff and you can focus on those and then all of a sudden instead of focusing on those you focus on this sort of emergent flavor percept and then you can't focus on the individual.
*  So if you're going to think about the balance in a wine, you really don't want to be thinking about the individual taste because that will just totally destroy the balance.
*  You just can't report on the aesthetic properties well if you're focusing on the individual taste.
*  So for it to be diachronic though, what you're essentially saying is that these processes need to build up over time, right?
*  These different modalities need to interact over time to then give rise to a later emergent state of wine bliss or what have you.
*  Yeah, well, so the reason why I mean I haven't worked this out but I think it's a it's a might be one case where if I'm going to say that there's some emergence is going to do something like ontological emergence is going to do some real work in the neuroscience.
*  This would be a case where what I would think is that you have you can either experience the sort of individual percepts.
*  So the taste and the smell and focus on those or you can experience the balance and you sort of might oscillate back and forth between these two and when you start feeling the balance, you just don't experience the individual percepts.
*  You just can't focus on the same way.
*  And then when you focus on the individual process, you just literally can't report on the balance.
*  I mean, the wine tasters can't.
*  There's empirical evidence that when you're when you're telling me other blackberries in the wine, you can do that.
*  But at that moment, if you ask is the wine good?
*  I have no idea if the wine is any good because I'm not experiencing these sort of general flavor properties.
*  So I think that's a case there might be when we look at the sort of more details of neuroscience.
*  Yeah, that's a nice case.
*  But you see exactly what that's good.
*  I mean, that's got a lot of empirically well confirmed details.
*  Exactly.
*  The really nice thing about research on emergence in the last couple of decades is that in some areas anyway,
*  it's got away from this air of mystery that used to surround it and is something that was one of the reasons why
*  it interested emergence really sort of fell off the edge of a cliff at one time.
*  But that's what you want, you know, some really good informed evidence for a particular result.
*  And notice also the other the other disanalogy between that case and the sort of consciousness debate is what I wasn't trying to tell you is how consciousness emerges from the physical.
*  That sort of explanations in flavor perception gives you nothing of that.
*  What I was trying to tell you is how one conscious experience can emerge from another conscious experience.
*  I think those are sort of tractable empirical questions where this sort of philosophical models might really help.
*  But things get messy when you start talking about the mind body problem.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, so I mean, this is one.
*  OK, so there's a lot to lot to chew on here.
*  One aspect is that isn't it great that the idea of consciousness and emergence being an emergent phenomenon actually popularized the idea of emergence,
*  which now we can take back and say, OK, let's like look at it in these grounded empirically well studied examples to figure out what emergence is.
*  Because then you have consciousness, which is also a mystery.
*  Right. So it doesn't make much sense to study one mystery with another.
*  But consciousness has also enjoyed a period now where there are attempts to study consciousness grounding it in these other empirical known
*  facts and well studied situations as well.
*  So it'll be nice when these guys can both join back up less of a mystery.
*  Right. Emergence and consciousness.
*  Although there's still a lot to be had within within their their joining right now, I suppose.
*  But so why has emergence historically and is still just associated so much with consciousness?
*  Why can't people be happy with studying emergence at the on these all these these infinite other processes that could be emergent?
*  Well, I don't know. I'm not a psychiatrist.
*  I have to be careful because I know that a lot of your audience is a neuroscience and so forth.
*  Be very careful.
*  But I really do think it's just because we don't properly understand consciousness.
*  And, you know, there are standard histories that say if you look at the historical development emergence in the 1920s around that.
*  Life was one of their core examples.
*  And then, you know, we come on and then we get to the development of vernacular biology.
*  And now people really start understanding what the processes behind living organisms are.
*  And that's when that example slips away from you.
*  Well, it's a organism centered biology now.
*  Right. That that does actually you organisms.
*  But there are people in organic biology that do want to claim that organisms are so strongly emergent from their molecular processes.
*  And you can't understand biology by just talking about.
*  Yeah, indeed. I mean, now we go back.
*  But here's the history.
*  Right. So in the 19th century, life was a prime example.
*  Went on through the 1920s and then you get up to 1953.
*  And then after that, it starts dissolving.
*  But now, I mean, biologists are back with some really interesting examples.
*  But that's because we understand, you know, how proteins interact to get metabolism.
*  And metabolism seems to be a candidate for an emergent feature.
*  So, you know, these things go up and down.
*  But the thing that drives them is you either find a reductive model that works and then the emergence goes away.
*  Right. Or you start seeing that, in fact, you can't get that kind of reductive model.
*  And now it's no longer mysterious.
*  You've really got something great to latch on to and start asking, well, how do you get this from the ingredients?
*  But then you have that moment. But then you have to decide, oh, God, is it ontological or epistemological?
*  Emergence, right?
*  You do. And again, I understand your audience is not necessarily oriented in this direction.
*  But there are great examples of physics in physics where it's really hard to explain away the ontological emergence.
*  So the standard example is quantum entanglement, that the joint state of some interacting systems
*  that cannot be properly reduced to the states of the individual, what used to be the individual component.
*  Right. There's a wonderful example that is discussed by Olivia Sartney and Alexandra O'Qua of the fractional quantum ball effect.
*  And what you get there is that you take a system that has three spatial dimensions and cut out the third spatial dimension.
*  So it's operating in two dimensions.
*  And what you find is that there is a law in the two dimensional case that not only is not present in the three dimensional case,
*  but in fact, couldn't be. It's prohibited by the three dimensional model.
*  That's really hard to explain away as epistemological emergence.
*  You know, you can you can get those those cases.
*  But, you know, I certainly don't want to say that ontological emergence is an easy thing to really get.
*  Well, so you keep mentioning, you know, the bent of my neuroscience minded audience here.
*  So there are a lot of subjects in philosophy that continue alongside experimental neuroscience, right?
*  Things that are being tested in neuroscience, experimented theoretical questions being asked.
*  And philosophy runs right alongside those and continues to refine definitions and and, you know, move concepts around.
*  But, you know, there's no real that I'm aware of.
*  There's no real experimental science of emergence yet.
*  And I and you can correct me if I'm wrong.
*  But if I'm right, you know, do you see emergence becoming something that we can experimentally ask about query?
*  Yeah, in fact, in a slightly different sense, one of the really interesting developments in the last few years is the hope
*  and it's empirically ground in some cases that you can engineer emergence.
*  I mean, you know, philosophers have I think a lot of other people say, well, emergence is a natural phenomenon
*  and you have to develop theories and observing so forth.
*  But especially in biology, there's a growing sense that you can actually go there in the lab and not just experimentally mess around with natural systems, but engineer them.
*  Are you talking about conception and giving birth in the lab, Paul?
*  Is that what you're getting at here?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, that's that's that's that's sounds like I'm at the end of anyway.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Are you sure that IRB approved those experiments?
*  I want to come back to that engineering aspect a little bit later.
*  But before we move on, I want to know what for this is for Paul specifically, what's the most common question you get asked about emergence?
*  It's undoubtedly is consciousness emerging.
*  And what do you say?
*  Do you just do you just roll your eyes and walk away or what?
*  No, I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I give them the answer that I gave you that I certainly don't know enough about neuroscience and cognitive psychology to say whether it is or it isn't.
*  And no disrespect to the state of neuroscience because it's astonishingly hard.
*  I don't think that we're there yet.
*  So that's my answer.
*  The vast, vast majority of neuroscientists would agree with you so we can all be friends.
*  So speaking of consciousness, so I was I was doing a guided mindful meditation a couple of weeks ago, actually.
*  And this is a true story.
*  So I was listening to someone guide me through a mindful meditation and the Guider, I suppose, emphasized, you know, how contents of our consciousness will appear and disappear.
*  And during a mindful meditation, you know, your goal is to just kind of notice these and kind of watch them.
*  Right.
*  That's one of the goals anyway.
*  And so I was sitting there and I had this thought come into my head.
*  I don't remember what it was.
*  It was probably, you know, like, oh, you must edit a podcast or something like that.
*  And I kind of what, you know, I could watch it disappear.
*  And I thought and then I came out of my mindfulness, of course, and I thought, oh, there really hasn't been much research that I know of on how thoughts extinguish.
*  Right. On on what I'm about to say is that the dynamic aspect of thinking now, Zach, you have studied the neuroscience and philosophy of spontaneous thought and of mind wandering, especially.
*  And and you've even defined mind wandering as unguided attention.
*  And of course, I will link to a ton of your papers in the show notes here.
*  But but maybe let's switch to this idea of spontaneous thought and mind wandering.
*  And what is it?
*  Sure. And we can get back to the mindfulness question afterwards.
*  We have some conceptual resources on the table.
*  So here's here's the idea.
*  Say there's a student who is in class and rather than pay attention to the lecture, her mind starts wandering.
*  So she wanders from a camping trip that she's going to go on with her friends to a party that she just had last weekend, maybe to a test that she's going to take next week.
*  And I think that what makes her thoughts wandering is that they sort of wander or meander from one topic to another.
*  So I think that sort of dynamics of thought is really what defines mind wandering.
*  And one of the nice things about that is it gives us clear contrast cases between mind wandering and other types of thought.
*  So think about that same student sits in class, still not paying attention to lecture, but she's deliberately working through a math group.
*  I think that's not mind wandering.
*  And in fact, some of my recent work has done sort of experimental philosophy to use the sort of methods,
*  vignette based methods of experimental philosophy to survey what experimentally test what ordinary people think about mind wandering.
*  And they also think that the sort of dynamics of thought sort of where they're sort of wandering from one topic to another is far more central to the sort of ordinary
*  boat concept of mind wandering and to Michael's apothecary of mind wandering than sort of whether the students paying attention to lecture or not.
*  It really depends on.
*  Yeah, so we can contrast this with what's been kind of thought of as the traditional definition of mind wandering, which is just task.
*  So generally in neuroscience, we study task related phenomenon, right?
*  And so people have been thinking of mind wandering and spontaneous thought of just the opposite of that without really considering the dynamics of it,
*  which you're saying are really is the quintessential aspect of it.
*  Yeah, and Felicity Callard did this really nice stuff on she did this sociology of mind wandering research where she made this nice paper where she made an argument
*  that this is sort of like a hangover of behaviorism is that we had this cognitive revolution in the 50s, right?
*  Where we stopped talking about behavior and we started talking about intermental processes.
*  But what did we use to study intermental processes?
*  Well, we use tasks, right?
*  The same kind of sort of behavioral tasks that behaviors would use, right?
*  And this was great for studying all sorts of aspects of the mind.
*  But it assumes that all everything the mind does is going to be past related.
*  And so and then what we did in neuroscience is said, okay, all right, so not everything that the mind in the 2000s people had this revolution with not everything the mind does is task related.
*  Wow, isn't that weird?
*  So everything that the mind doesn't do that's task related is the same then, right?
*  Which I think is a problematic assumption.
*  I think that there are there are deep differences between different kinds of ways your thoughts can unfold when you're not paying attention to a task.
*  You're my consider wander from one topic to another.
*  You can just pursue another task or another goal and sort of direct your thoughts.
*  You can also ruminate and fixate on the same topic over and over and over again.
*  I think the dynamics of those different types of thoughts are very different.
*  And I hypothesize working with neuroscientists like Lena Christoph that the neuro neuro underpinnings of those different types of thoughts are very different as well.
*  Yeah, so you working with Kalina Christoph whom you just mentioned.
*  So you guys have a couple papers where there's this kind of scale right of categories of spontaneous thought and it's along an access of sort of deliberate constraints on those thoughts, right?
*  And the least constrained in the within the category of spontaneous thought, the least constrained type of thought is dreaming, right?
*  Along this access and then a little bit more constrained is mind wandering.
*  And then just above mind wandering in constraint is creative thinking being the most constrained of these spontaneous thought categories.
*  So so I'm just we're going to kind of jump around here.
*  But so I can think of of a function for dreaming, right?
*  And sleep and the dreaming of just yeah, go ahead.
*  One one thing first is there's also the access of automatic constraints as well.
*  So here's the sort of quick and dirty version of the neural hypothesis.
*  Good. Yeah.
*  Let's say you're having a stream of memories, right?
*  Or you're imagining some scenes that's going to depend on the medial temporal sub network within the default network is going to be what's or part of what's activating that sort of perceptual processing when you're sort of say imagining a scene and hearing some sounds that you might have on like a beach or something like that.
*  Let me just interject and just state that the default network is when you're talking about this revolution is it's just a set of a distributed set of brain areas that come online when you're not doing task related activities.
*  That's the sort of overall default network.
*  And what's been discovered is that there's lots of different sub networks of the default network and some can come online within these different types of mental processes.
*  It's also been discovered though that like I mean, that's that was the sort of original picture of the default network.
*  Yeah, the default network is actually engaged in task related thought to right.
*  So for example, Nathan Springs work suggests that you can sort of engage in autobiographical planning.
*  So really goal-directed focused planning that activates the default network.
*  And one thing that might suggest is, oh, it turns out this default network, which has been traditionally associated with mind wandering.
*  Right.
*  So one thing Nathan's work could suggest is maybe mind wandering is goal-directed and focused and there really isn't this difference between these different dynamics of thoughts or mind interpretation.
*  It might suggest that we need to look more at sort of how the default networks activity can be constrained by other networks.
*  So in the case of affective thought, how sort of limbic systems and salience networks can sort of focus you on what sort of affectively salient to you to say when you're obsessing about a fight that you just had with your friend.
*  Right. And you're thinking over and over and over again about that friend, that fight or in the case where you're engaging goal-directed thoughts,
*  say when you're solving an algebra problem and sort of frontal parietal control networks can sort of focus you on what's relevant to the algebra problem.
*  So you're sort of not paying attention to other things or in the case of I think of mind wandering where the default network is is free from those sort of top down constraints and thus can sort of generate this associative stream
*  of memories and imaginative experiences because these constraints are absent.
*  I have more philosophically to say about what those constraints I think that they're not just constraints, they're guidance.
*  And so that's a more substantive theory than you find in the neuroscience.
*  But what that constraint amounts to, I think that guidance is absent in the case of mind.
*  Great. Well, yeah.
*  So did you want to speak a little bit more about mind wandering in the brain or one of the things that I like and that's a common thread in this podcast is just that dynamics.
*  How important dynamics are so so the example of diachronic emergence, right?
*  So no one thinks of emergence as occurring over time, right?
*  I don't know if we're just not equipped to think of things happening in time in that way because no one was talking about mind mind wandering as a dynamic process.
*  But it's such a common it's such an obvious way to think about it once you understand it, right?
*  Yeah, and I think part of the reason why is because it was just like.
*  It's a lot easier to interrupt someone and say, hey, was the last thought that you just had a slice.
*  Think about that thought, that individual thought was that thought related to the task that you were doing in the experimental in the lab, right?
*  That's a lot easier to ask than the kind of questions that my colleagues and I have asked.
*  So like in Caitlin knows that this really nice paper where we asked about where your thoughts sort of freely moving from one topic to another, right?
*  And it turns out I think that you can learn a lot about this stream of consciousness by asking those kind of questions.
*  But there was that those kind of questions are harder to ask the participants and folks in psychology who are sort of wary of introspection, right?
*  Because in mind wandering research, you have to ask subjects about their experiences.
*  That's like that's the sort of gold standard for how you classify thought.
*  And there's been a sort of principal skepticism about introspection.
*  So if you're asking about some really coarse grained features of a single thought, like are you thinking about the experimental task?
*  I think psychologists were less wary about that than if you're asking these more fine grained features, like are you are your thoughts freely moving from one topic to another?
*  Are you sort of obsessively focused on a single thing?
*  Are your thoughts directed to a single topic and giving people instructions on how to answer those questions?
*  I think that those, you know, there's an open question as to whether people can well, I don't think there's no question.
*  I think there's some empirical evidence that we've been gathering that people actually can answer those questions and sort of classify their thoughts in meaningful ways.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think those who are skeptical of introspection were more worried about those kind of questions,
*  which is what led us from these sort of methods to the definitions that focus on the contents of thoughts, what's going on at a single time, because they're just easier to measure.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like the old analogy of like, you know, why is a person man looking for his keys under the lamp, right, or under a road light?
*  Because, you know, there's light here.
*  That's where the light is.
*  Butchered that joke.
*  No, no, that's good.
*  Oh, don't worry.
*  I'll edit it.
*  It'll sound great.
*  How do we keep that in?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So maybe we can bring it back to mindfulness a little bit.
*  But, you know, because.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  So, well, okay.
*  First of all, let's go back to the scale and then we'll move on to AI.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So just thinking about dreaming as being, you know, constraint free.
*  And I'm just going to keep it on the one axis for now.
*  And then mind wandering, have a few more constraints and then creative thinking a little bit more constrained, but still under the rubric of spontaneous thought, which I really like that classification.
*  Where does mindfulness, mindful meditation fit within this guided versus unguided attention versus spontaneous thought goal directed thought scale?
*  Where does that fit in?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's a great question.
*  It's one that I've been working with Sonam Katru on.
*  We have a project on harnessing the wandering mind where we're looking at ways of sort of that people have directed things like mind wandering in sort of Buddhist traditions.
*  One thing to understand about these traditions is there's a lot of different types of Buddhists and there's a lot of different types of meditation.
*  Right.
*  This is like asking sort of how does how does, you know, Western philosopher characterize.
*  The emergence.
*  Consciousness.
*  How does a Western philosopher characterize beliefs or any of the things we talk about?
*  There's a lot of debate.
*  Right.
*  And I think what you find is that there are certain types of attention practices like sort of focused attention practices that mindfulness practices that look very different than mind wandering.
*  So think about the practice of paying attention to your breath as it's exiting your nose.
*  Right. And where what you're doing is just the goal is to keep your attention focused on that specific content of that experience.
*  That I think looks very different than mind wandering.
*  Right.
*  But think about other practices where and Sonam has suggested and this is part of our research that you're going to find these practices a lot more in Zen meditation in China and Japan than in the sort of more rationalist meditation practices that you find in India and Tibet.
*  But there are other practices where or this is this is the thing that we're trying to argue is where what you're doing is just letting your thoughts wander and watching them.
*  And then what you're doing in so far as you're exerting control over your thoughts, what you're doing is stopping your mind from getting focused on anything in particular.
*  OK.
*  I think that's really cool.
*  That's a really cool category of thought from the perspective of the mental action.
*  So that that that's like a constraint on not having constraints sort of right.
*  Exactly. It's a sort of like active passivity.
*  What you're doing is making sure that you're you're actively maintaining initiating and maintaining the state when you're where your thoughts are passively unfolding from one topic to another where you're not exerting any control over the first order contents of your thought.
*  I think that's a perfectly coherent.
*  I think that's what might be going on.
*  There are these there are lots of so Paul Kelly has this great research program that started with Jambria, but he really developed it on intentional mind wandering.
*  So this is when people report that my mind wandered on purpose.
*  So you asked a student in the classroom, you know, did you just find that your mind was wandering or did you intentionally let your mind wander?
*  And students often report that they intentionally let their mind wander.
*  And in fact, when you look at the English, when you look at the how people speak about mind wandering, the most common thing that we say the most common colocate for mind wandering is left.
*  Like I let my mind wander.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  And so there's this pervasive evidence that this is the thing that people can do.
*  They can intentionally mind wander.
*  And I think that one of the but that's really weird.
*  Right. Like how can you intentionally do this passive thing?
*  That's a big puzzle that philosophers shouldn't engage in.
*  And in fact, there have been philosophers, Sam Marine, Christina Krasich have actually argued that's impossible.
*  Intentional mind wandering. Yeah, people say they do it, but it's literally it's logically impossible that people are doing the thing that they're doing.
*  I think it is possible.
*  And I think that that's because what people are doing is they're intentionally initiating and maintaining this sort of unguided mode of thought.
*  And I think that kind of intentional maintenance of an unguided mode of thought is actually much better theorized.
*  And then in Buddhist traditions, especially in China and Japan, that has been in the West, it's just very foreign.
*  Well, has been in Western psychology.
*  If you look at sort of like Western creative individuals who talk about their own thought processes, then this kind of thought gets theorized a lot.
*  Right.
*  Malakari Keen in English has talked about writers who talk about maintaining this sort of passive mode of thinking where you just like let ideas come to you.
*  Let them use.
*  Something to learn how to do.
*  It's a super interesting human capacity and type of human mental action that's just completely untheorized in philosophy and in cognitive science more.
*  It's under theorized.
*  Yeah. And in neuroscience as well.
*  That's the beautiful thing is there's just so much to do.
*  The more we answer, of course, the more questions there are, which is beautiful in some sense and extremely frustrating in some other sense.
*  But but so OK, just to bring it back to mind wandering before we move on.
*  So what you know, on that scale, I was talking about with dreaming, I can think of a function for dreaming.
*  There's an obvious function for creative thinking because you're going to you know, you'll an emergent thought will come and then you'll make your next best product.
*  But what might be the function of mind wandering?
*  Well, I mean, you just mentioned creative thinking, and I think one of the functions for mind wandering might be to sort of facilitate creativity.
*  And there's some evidence for that.
*  I'm hoping that we'll get better empirical evidence for that if we look at this sort of distinguish the different subtypes of task-related thought.
*  But so one of the one of the functions for mind wandering might be to facilitate creativity.
*  So here's how it would work on my sort of model.
*  Let's say that say you're sort of like gauged and goal-directed thought about a problem.
*  That's great that you can do that.
*  It's really important because it allows humans to focus on the things that we really want to focus on and work through them and keep their job.
*  Yeah, keep their job.
*  Exactly.
*  What problem with doing that is when you focus on some goal-directed topic, you have to have a task set.
*  So that's sort of some understanding of what's relevant to the problem and what isn't.
*  And that's great, too, because when you sort of focus on how to edit your podcast, you don't want to have the thought pop into your mind that, oh, maybe I should just like inject a bunch of metal in the middle.
*  And so that's why whenever Paul talks, there's going to be sort of metal going on.
*  When Zach talks, there's going to be Bach or something.
*  Don't think that.
*  Hopefully that idea doesn't just spontaneously pop into your mind.
*  That would be a very bad way to edit your podcast.
*  That shouldn't be in the task set.
*  Well, I guess we'll see.
*  So, but and so it's good that you can sort of limit yourself to the relevant topics.
*  You can limit you focus your attention.
*  But there's also cost to that, which is that you can be wrong.
*  So you can think that what's relevant to solving a problem is X.
*  And it might turn out that there's some sort of creative insight that you've missed and the right way to think about it might.
*  Maybe you focus when you're focusing on mind wandering, maybe you exclusively think about mind wandering as task unrelated thought.
*  And because you're sort of focused on that conception of the scientific phenomenon, you completely miss the dynamics.
*  Right. And you ignore it.
*  And I think a lot of cases of really creative insights are precisely when we just think about a problem in a new way.
*  I think mind wandering allows us to do that because it's not guided to a topic and thus the sort of task set is exerting less control over what you're thinking, how you were thinking about each topic that you're thinking about.
*  I think it allows you to have these sort of creative insights, which is why, for example, that people with ADHD, whose we predict, whose minds wander a lot more in this sort of strict sense of their meandering from topic to topic.
*  Why those folks tend to be more creative than their intelligence matched peers, even though they have lots of difficulties.
*  Right. I mean, I like definitely on the spectrum for that.
*  Right. It causes lots of problems, but it also helps me, I think, come up with the creative ideas that I do.
*  And and that there's other evidence that mind wandering instead of facilitate creativity.
*  I think that's partly why is because it allows us to think about seemingly irrelevant stuff.
*  It may be a good hypothesis for why when people get stuck on problems that are very goal directed issues, you know, if you just put put your work down and go for a walk outside, right, just generates spontaneous mind wandering and all of a sudden you find the solution.
*  Yeah, exactly. And there's two very different explanations for that effect.
*  It's called the incubation effect. So why is it helpful to sort of go and do something else, right?
*  To take a shower, wash some dishes, go for a walk. Why does that sort of help us solve problems?
*  One explanation for that is just it gives you time to think about the problem more.
*  But the problem with that is, well, then why don't you just keep sitting down?
*  Another explanation for it is just you stop thinking about the problem.
*  And and so you just go you just do something completely different.
*  Your mind isn't occupied with this at all.
*  And then when you come back to it, there's some unconscious processes might be better at solving greater problems.
*  I think one worry about that is, well, often when I go to the shower and I'm working on paper, I still keep thinking about the paper.
*  Right. And often this nominologically, it seems like in a lot of these cases, what happens is we do keep thinking about the problem.
*  But at least with third hypothesis about why, which is I thought this is that I think happens sometimes is we think about the problem in a different way.
*  The dynamics are unguided.
*  Well, maybe think about the problem for a second and think about something else.
*  Maybe think in weird ways about the problem that we haven't before.
*  And I think there's this sort of mode of conscious thought or sort of mode of the stream of thought, sort of mind wandering that actually has a function in allowing us to sort of think about problems in new ways.
*  And that's my hypothesis.
*  Very good. So, I mean, there's a lot more we could talk about, obviously, you know, and I'll leave it to the listeners, really, because there are a lot of clinical implications.
*  You mentioned ADHD. But just for the rate of wandering from topic to topic, you know, and just the interactions of different types of systems and their individual dynamic rates.
*  So but for the interest of time today, let's let's wander into the topic of A.I.
*  So emergence and mind wandering have something in common in that you don't hear them often mentioned in the same breath as artificial intelligence.
*  So so let's make that happen here. You don't often hear it anyway.
*  Of course, I could be wrong. So we're going to hop around and touch on A.I. with both of these topics a little bit.
*  So I keep dropping names, too. You know, so so I interviewed Ryota Kanai, who whose goal is to study the functions of consciousness and then build it into artificial intelligence systems.
*  Right. So let's say, Paul, let's say emergence is an important phenomenon to establish consciousness, you know, that it's always associated with consciousness or gives rise to consciousness and or or general artificial intelligence.
*  For instance, and we talked we touched on this earlier.
*  Do you think that it's a worthwhile endeavor to try to manifest emergence in an A.I. system?
*  And if so, how would one go about doing that?
*  And we can ask the same about mind wandering in a second.
*  Yeah. OK. So let me take that question is slightly different direction.
*  I think you probably wanted to go in to look at the question.
*  I think you probably wanted to go in to me in artificial intelligence is the artificial part that is is really important.
*  So the research projects, which of course, perfectly respectable and neural inspired architectures have given us a lot of interesting insights.
*  But those projects that model artificial intelligence on human intelligence are only part of how you can investigate artificial intelligence.
*  And there's no obvious reason why one should try to create consciousness, especially if you're working with a computational theory of the mind.
*  Right. Consciousness plausibly could just be a biological process, in which case, unless you got biological computing, you're probably not going to get it out.
*  You know, neural nets in the artificial realm.
*  So that's just one thing I wanted to throw out there, because, you know, I find it think about other areas.
*  I mean, if people who were in the early days of investigating flight, they tried to model it on birds, as some of them did, they failed spectacularly.
*  You have to think that there are other ways of doing this.
*  And it's often going to be that you're you're more successful.
*  Well, commodities are not literally horses.
*  Yeah. Well, yeah.
*  So, you know, I everyone I ask about this, about how how to how to create a GI.
*  Is there a way besides, you know, just modeling everything after what we know about humans, human intelligence and almost to a T, there are exceptions like like last week.
*  But they say, well, humans are the the only example that we know of that have this property that we want to create.
*  Right. And actually, a an exception was Sam Gershman, whom I had on last weekend.
*  And he with some other people wrote this paper about how if we want machines to think like humans, the current state of AI and deep learning is is missing a bunch of features like intuitive physics and psychology, intuitive psychology and causality, for instance.
*  So there's, you know, this push to build these human processes into deep learning and AI systems.
*  And so but how might an AI agent benefit from something like mind wandering, for instance?
*  Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, I would want to argue for not thinking in those terms.
*  I mean, there are, of course, analogous processes in artificial intelligence.
*  I mean, so sarcastic gradient descent, you know, simulated annealing and so forth.
*  When they're introducing noise into the system in order to stop you getting in in a seriously suboptimal state.
*  So they're analogous. But, you know, why do we need a mind?
*  We already know that deep neural nets are way better than us at playing chess and go right.
*  No way we're going to catch up with that.
*  In other ways, they're seriously inferior and humans have better capacities in those realms.
*  But, you know, let's pursue both research traditions.
*  And it's plausible that you'll come out ahead by forgetting about clearly psychological features and in other ways you won't.
*  It depends on whether you want to build machines to do cool stuff or whether you want to build machines to model the mind.
*  Sure. Not just model the mind, but figure out the mind, right?
*  Learn what the mind is. Right. Right.
*  And those are two very different research programs.
*  Like, does an algorithm that relies on having vastly more computations than humans could ever have.
*  Does that tell us how human mind works? I don't know.
*  And they're both legitimate research programs. Right.
*  But don't take this the wrong way. I don't find humans very interesting.
*  Well, it's been nice talking to you guys.
*  Yeah. If my wife is going to listen to this, I'm in real trouble.
*  But you see what I mean.
*  There are many, many, many ways of investigating the world in which humans are actually a handicap.
*  And you need to think much more broadly than focusing the idea on a single example of intelligence, which is clearly seriously suboptimal.
*  Well, I mean, so if you're going to focus on here's an advantage that humans have over AI.
*  We were designed by evolution and evolution comes up with really clever solutions.
*  And it's had millions of years to do it. And it's had millions of years to do it.
*  And it comes up with really clever solutions that human engineers just don't come up with.
*  One example of this that I talk about in my philosophy of neuroscience class is how the hand is processed.
*  So in the brain, so like how hand movements are processed.
*  So you think like if a human engineer was designing it, you know, you'd have a one little bit that processes the thumb and the finger and then all of these each digit.
*  And then you combine them together into this matter of process.
*  But it's just like, this is not how the brain does it with the brain processes is gross motor movements like this.
*  Right. Because those were evolutionarily important.
*  And then he just chopped Paul in the neck for the listeners.
*  Oh, yeah, that's right.
*  So, yeah, that's fine.
*  I'm not denying that you get leads to some very interesting processes.
*  But think about the role that machine learning plays in high energy physics these days.
*  The Large Hadron Collider could not do anything because of the quantitative data that's got without, you know, if you allow the machine learning is part of the human's adjust completely out of the picture there until,
*  you know, you've got some some event that that looks interesting.
*  So, you know, all I'm trying to urge is that we should not think of humans as the only part of the solution space in these areas.
*  There's there's a huge set of alternative possibilities which we're only just beginning to to understand.
*  And of course, this leads into an area which is because the thing that a lot of people are really interested in.
*  And that is the ethics of this.
*  So if you're a rationalist about ethics, you're roughly a can't do this in areas where artificial intelligence is actually better than we are.
*  Why not look to that for superior ethical solutions?
*  You know, restricting yourself to humans where we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are ethically seriously deficient is not a good place to be.
*  I mean, I don't see why you I mean, this is more getting into sort of applications of AI.
*  I think better approaches would be to feed human inputs into a machine learning system.
*  So, like, well, there's an archaic work on organ joy.
*  So how to choose who to give an organ to.
*  So what he does is he he has general theories that are fed into an algorithm in addition to folk psychological judgments on particular cases that you get by just looking at enter.
*  And you feed that into a machine learning algorithm.
*  So it tries to abstract the sort of general rules that would most fairly apply those human judgments.
*  And this is also how I like to think about, you know, using machine learning to classify neural states as well.
*  I think that on the one hand, you want to use these these these great techniques.
*  But on the other hand, I'm sort of I'm a pluralist about methodology where I think that machine learning is going to have some deficits that sort of well, I mean, you have to feed data into the machine learning algorithm.
*  And so if you're not using your sort of best theories of phenomenon to sort of feed the data like of organ choice, right, if you're not.
*  But I don't I mean, I said before, of course, I'm a pluralist about this, too.
*  And it depends if you have access to extremely large data sets.
*  Right. You're in one situation.
*  If you're in some areas of social sciences where it's difficult, really expensive to get data sets like that restricted small data sets, you've got to use use different methods.
*  What I was urging simply is that, you know, we should stop thinking that humans are somehow the epitome of of excellence in certain areas because it's it's difficult.
*  Look how many areas that he was just screwed up in in Audrey's life.
*  You know, I would in some cases prefer to go with AI than with you.
*  Yeah. So I know one of your interests, Paul, is computational science.
*  And you wrote a book called Extending Ourselves.
*  And it's in large part about how with modern technology and things like AI, we can reach beyond what we can epistemologically, for instance, or grasp as humans.
*  And so we have this scenario, this potential scenario, like you're discussing with the Large Hadron Collider and other things where we could potentially use AI to compute things, get an answer, not understand how we got the answer,
*  but but then potentially put our trust in it.
*  Right. And the answer, because we know it's better than we are at this certain time.
*  Yeah. And that is, as you know, currently a central problem in what's called explainable artificial intelligence that deep neural nets are to a large extent opaque.
*  We know the algorithmic network, how they work, but we don't know in sufficient details what activation levels are representing what.
*  And and I entirely agree with you that that is essentially a dangerous situation to be in.
*  If you look at like that, we don't know how humans do things.
*  But the antidote to that black box problem is that we do have access to all of the units in the deep neural net.
*  Now, we might need to use a different neural net to analyze the first neural net, right, to get to understand it.
*  But but we do have at least access to all of the quote unquote neurons, the neural units in the net.
*  We do. And I think to a certain extent, you know, it is true that when you build something, you've got better access to it.
*  But I was persuaded that that can't be generally true by my colleague, Worthy Martin, when he pointed out that the Wright brothers really had almost no idea about how aeronautics works.
*  And and yet they were they were successful.
*  So, you know, having built the fire, but a central goal of science is explanation.
*  Mm hmm. Right. And so far as we're going to use a eye to do science where we're trying to understand the world, then the goal, I think that if you don't have explainable, I write where it's not going to give you explanations, then it's limited as a scientific tool.
*  That that seems to me, you know, as a eccentric mistake.
*  I mean, it's, you know, we want that kind of understanding for the kind of science we've done in the last 400 years or so.
*  But that doesn't mean that the only way to conduct science is by firmly nailing it down to what humans can do.
*  The human genome project would never be completed as fast as it was if it wasn't for automated genome sequencing.
*  You know, we sort of understand that. But now we've got the sequence. Now humans can go in and stop trying to do it.
*  So I can talk back to my especially my as a as a weird side note.
*  The first paper I ever published was on Paul's book on this topic.
*  And what I really liked there. So what I what I talked about was the use of and what Paul's also talked about is the use of visualizations in computer simulations.
*  So one of the sort of revolutions that led to computers being able to do the kind of role, the role they have, the kind of role they have in science is that we can visualize very, very large data sets in the way that allow us to detect computationally and epistemically emerging phenomenon that we couldn't detect without.
*  And so we can use those simulations. But to see why I think that's like a really important scientific development, it's because it allows humans to understand and explain phenomena in the world in a way that they wouldn't be able to before.
*  That understanding and explanation is those are those have a cognitive component to them.
*  And so I do think it's anthropocentric that this understanding of science. But I mean, I think that science is anthropocentric.
*  We have a very fundamental disagreement.
*  The only way to work this out is to hang around for a couple of hundred years.
*  You see, you know, when I first published that book, I got a lot of sneers from philosophers.
*  This is just number crunching, it's cosmology completely important.
*  Things have changed a bit. You look at the history of computer assisted mathematics.
*  I mean, there was enormous resistance to that by mathematicians for perfectly understandable reasons.
*  I mean, along the lines that Zach has mentioned, but the mathematics community has come to accommodate it to a certain extent.
*  And it is a matter of, you know, how far do you want this to extend into the traditional subject and how far you don't.
*  That's a metaphor, technological determinism and all kinds of other things.
*  But let's not be Luddites about this kind of thing.
*  Speaking of Luddites in that book, and we're going to move on to some general questions here because we're running short on time.
*  But that's an excellent book extending ourselves.
*  One of my favorite parts in the book, though, is when there's this footnote.
*  You mentioned Legos as an example, and then there's a footnote where you have to define what a Lego is.
*  Lego is not a rooted plastic.
*  I guess in evolutionary timescales that might be relevant, but I think everyone knows what a Lego is, right?
*  No, I didn't. I'm sorry, your readers can't see me. I was born a long time ago.
*  And there weren't Legos around then, believe it or not.
*  So, you know, maybe I was talking to the wrong crowd.
*  But you're right, everybody now knows what Lego is.
*  Yeah, in the updated version, you could remove the footnote, although it was one of my favorite parts.
*  Yeah, that's alarming.
*  Yeah, that's alarming.
*  So let's just get into some broader questions here.
*  And these are for both of you, all of these questions.
*  So how do you guys view the role of philosophy with respect to neuroscience and or artificial intelligence?
*  What's the role of philosophy here?
*  Why did you do the neuroscience?
*  Sure. Yeah, absolutely.
*  So I think we have this sort of ordinary understanding of mental phenomena, like mind wandering and like attention and like memory,
*  that philosophers are really good at analyzing sort of ordinary concepts.
*  And sometimes I think that there are cases, like in my field, where finding this sort of ordinary way of understanding mind wandering that links it to its dynamics can actually lead to a great deal of scientific progress.
*  Because so one way you get these like very different polls of how philosophers have approached psychology, where you get sort of one poll where philosophers say, you know, we really don't need to pay attention to what the scientists are doing.
*  Right. You get another poll that says we just need to read our concepts off of scientists.
*  So if I'm trying to do philosophy of mind and understand what attention is, understand what mind wandering is, this is actually what my advisor, I'll tell him right now,
*  this is what my advisor Evan Thompson told me to do originally in my dissertation is just, well, mind wandering is a scientific concept.
*  So look at how the scientists define it. And that's going to be the right way of understanding it.
*  Interesting.
*  And I think that there's an approach in the middle which tries to engage with science and you want to formulate hypotheses that are testable by empirical research.
*  Maybe you want to work with empirical researchers to test those hypotheses.
*  But you don't take the way that scientists have understood a phenomenon as a given.
*  And you use sources of evidence, like how a concept has been conceived of historically by philosophers.
*  Right. Like mind wandering. I think Hobbes has the right view of mind wandering.
*  I've had hundreds and hundreds of years ago, you take evidence like how a phenomenon is conceived of in literature.
*  Right. I think Virginia Woolf has like a really innovative and interesting picture of mind wandering in other cultures and sort of Buddhist philosophy.
*  And just when you're sort of analyzing ordinary cases for yourselves, you take that sort of evidence for a phenomenon really seriously because it can lead you to discover different ways of thinking about the mind that as an historical contingent fact,
*  psychologists and neuroscientists of the present day have ignored.
*  You take even, I have some research taking where trying to, I think a really cool new trend in philosophy is to try and take folk psychological, like use the methods of experimental philosophy,
*  which gets at folk psychological understanding of philosophical concepts like responsibility and freedom and causation.
*  Use those same sort of methods to get at ordinary people's understanding of psychological concepts like mind wandering or control or attention.
*  And I think that those kind of methods where you're getting at the sort of ordinary understanding of a mental phenomenon can really inform the science.
*  Sometimes they'll be wrong. Sometimes we have this sort of ordinary understanding of phenomenon that's just funk. And sometimes we'll be right.
*  And so I think it's an independent source of evidence that philosophers are particularly well positioned to extract that can inform ongoing empirical debates.
*  And in fact, it is in my view.
*  And Paul, do you think, what do you think about AI?
*  AI is a bit different because the research traditions have changed.
*  So as people I'm sure know with traditional rule based AI, that came out of philosophy and logic.
*  So you've got Russell Whitehead and then you've got those great people, Girdle and Turing and so forth, who turned the theory of computation.
*  And then you've got Turing's famous paper about, you know, that gave us a Turing test and so forth.
*  And that's one place where there's a clear and solid connection between that tradition and philosophy.
*  Things are really difficult, much harder with neural net stuff because partly for practical reasons, it's developing so fast that I don't even know how people in the area keep up with that.
*  And it's it's divorced from the logic tradition.
*  And so the way that philosophers are trained, you know, you need statistics and machine learning and so forth to understand that.
*  And just because of the way that we're situated in the humanities, it's not likely that a lot of philosophers would have the background to do that.
*  So I actually don't know what's going to happen with that.
*  But in terms of problems that philosophers could help with, I mean, the ethical issues are going to be really, really important.
*  You've got to somehow grab Silicon Valley by the scrabble of the neck and shake them and say, listen, just pay attention to some of these things because socially they're vital importance.
*  And that doesn't mean the doomsday people like Elon Musk, we're all going to be killed by robots.
*  It's much more the effect of invasion of privacy or democracy and all those things that are coming into public view, the things that philosophers really got to pay attention to that are starting to do so.
*  But damn it, man, those are hard things to think about.
*  They are.
*  And one thing that is really hard to think about, but I think is fascinating is, could there be a specific machine ethics?
*  So people are interested in, you know, programming autonomous vehicles so that, you know, they won't mow you down when you're crossing the road.
*  And that's fine. And that's really important.
*  Suppose that you do get these artificial agents who in some areas are much better and smarter than you are doing this.
*  Could you get a specific machine ethics that is appropriate to that?
*  And if you do, how are you going to tether it to human interests and human ethics?
*  It could be different and you want it not to become too autonomous.
*  So there's a question which is, you know, what a PhD dissertation topic that's really hard, but really important and really interesting.
*  If I was going back to graduate school, I might do that.
*  Boy, you'd be setting yourself up for a difficult path.
*  Sam Gershman, last episode, I asked him what his advice would be to someone starting out and he said, well, you have to go basically swim against the current, you know,
*  and it might take a long time, but this is the way to do it. So that would be one one very difficult project.
*  It is because just to add one thing, I mean, the center of research is is now shifting back to to industry.
*  I mean, back in the days of Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, a lot of really important stuff done there.
*  And then for various reasons, which are also interesting,
*  universities became the only source of research for now.
*  You know, there's dual bases here, but they're different.
*  And so academic research is not the only place to be.
*  What do you guys think about from a philosopher's perspective, let's say, and Zach, I know that you've done neuroscience as well.
*  But right now, I'm going to pin you as a philosopher.
*  And from your perspective, you know, what is the relationship like between philosophy and and like the world of science and experimental science and stuff?
*  Is it I know we're all on the same team, but do you feel antagonism?
*  Do you feel symbiotic relationship or what?
*  Yeah, I think it depends on the neuroscientist.
*  So I think when you said, damn, it's really hard.
*  I think that gets at something that's really, it's really, really deep actually about the sociology of these interdisciplinary studies.
*  Like the first time I presented my view to a psych lab and I was like, oh, so here's the standard standard view of I won't say what state level was, but I said, here's the standard view of mine.
*  I'm wondering, here's all these counter examples that show that the view isn't isn't right.
*  And so we need this new counter example.
*  How is how is swearing on your show?
*  Not encouraged, not declined.
*  I mean, I feel free.
*  So no constraints.
*  Very little mind wander, no constraints.
*  OK, so I said what these problems, the standard view of my morning, what my view was.
*  And one of the postdocs in the lab, their response was verbatim.
*  That's horseshit.
*  And then to leave the room.
*  So that's it.
*  So that you get that response sometimes.
*  Right.
*  Sure.
*  I think the reason why you get that response is you're going in and telling people, hey, the way that you've been thinking about a phenomenon is problematic for all of these armchair reasons that.
*  I haven't done any work in the lab, which I have since.
*  But at that point, I haven't done any work in the lab.
*  I've been sitting in a chair and I'm telling you that something in your research is is is wrong.
*  Right.
*  And in fact, I'm telling you that the way if you're going to do it right, that you need to do it is like way harder and might not even be tractable.
*  So when you say that sort of thing, yeah, there's some antagonism that can be the natural response to that sort of critique, conceptual critique of the literature.
*  And I think one way to maybe thing that I've done since then to maybe make this a little bit easier is I have thought more specifically about how I would implement these sorts of conceptual critiques in an experiment.
*  And I've actually worked with neuroscientists to do the experimentation.
*  So I think one way to sort of reduce the antagonism is is not to just do some philosophy and then say near near near, but like do some philosophy and come up with these new ideas and then then work with scientists about how to test them and have be open to that sort of interdisciplinary work.
*  I think once once you do that, I think scientists tend to take you more more seriously because they know that you're actually you know what you're doing in the lab.
*  Yeah, yeah, it does. It takes a kind of a thick skin to I mean, you guys, I'll share this with you, but only about 10 percent of the podcasts that I record actually make it to air because usually what happens is I start asking them questions and they say that's horseshit and then they and then they hang up.
*  Yeah, I think part of the reason also sociological.
*  So like when I teach my classes, right, there's always because I try to have classes that are catering to neuroscience and cognitive science students.
*  And I think there's like about like the third or fourth weekend, there will be someone that comes up to me and says, what are we doing?
*  And like, is there all this is all so that has that that sort of neuroscience response.
*  And then two weeks later, I have without fail, the student who has said that has come back and said, I really like this.
*  This is great. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And there has to be like, it just I think we all sort of feel like, oh, we're good at analyzing concepts.
*  We can understand what we're talking about because we're smart.
*  Right. And well, philosophers have trained for a decade.
*  At least or much longer to do that. Well, and I think it's it's a it's a sort of can be a hard thing to sociologically to sort of, you know, defer to someone on conceptual analysis when you're a smart person and you work in a field.
*  Why should I listen to somebody just because they thought a lot?
*  Let me say something. This topic is really important to me.
*  So I used to do philosophy of physics and yeah, right.
*  It's a very interesting topic.
*  And I think it's a very interesting topic.
*  I think it's a very interesting topic.
*  So I used to do philosophy of physics and yeah, right.
*  It you know, as Zach said, you know, some physicists who are interested in philosophical issues, most of them are not because they've got their work to do and that's fine.
*  But what we've seen in the last decade or so is some really seriously ignorant attacks on philosophy of science.
*  So let's name names here in Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson.
*  Some of the features.
*  Here's what I would say to the audience.
*  I mean, by all means, criticize what philosophers are doing.
*  And I personally welcome that.
*  But please do it from an informed base.
*  I mean, go read some serious philosophy before you start laying into ideas that with all due respect to those two people, they clearly do not understand.
*  And the background was that they reinvented logical positivism.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Which is a which is I think one of the if there's a consensus about anything in philosophy because there's very few consensus.
*  One of the consensus is that people tried that theory and it failed.
*  It was actually perhaps the most miserable failure of the 20th century philosophy.
*  At least it was up there.
*  And then they reinvented that theory and said, hey, this is the right theory where we know that it's wrong.
*  Right.
*  So we would not, I hope, walk into a research seminar in neuroscience or.
*  Yeah.
*  And say, you know, this is just wrong and give some hopelessly elementary alternative that everybody in the room knows doesn't work.
*  Right.
*  But that's what these guys are doing here.
*  Well, yeah, that's the problem is to state state something with such definitiveness.
*  Right.
*  But also from a position we don't expect, you know, people who are not professional philosophers to know as much about philosophy as we do.
*  But there's got to be some kind of constructive engagement here because I'm sure that many of the things that philosophers do really will in retrospect look very naive and wrong and so forth.
*  But I wanted to get that out there for your audience because it's not a good way to proceed and I proceed.
*  And I think that, you know, I philosophy and neuroscience philosophy can really have some important constructive engagements.
*  And what I would say in terms of practical advice for how to sort of do that sort of interdisciplinary work is that a lot of the difficulty is just a translation exercise in terms of.
*  There are different disciplines that speak different languages that have different areas of expertise.
*  And so the burden on you, if you want to engage with philosophy or the burden on me, if I want to engage with neuroscientists, science is not to become as the burden on a neuroscientist is not become as good of a philosopher as a philosopher.
*  That's that's a totally unreasonable expectation.
*  And there's like, you know, two people, maybe, maybe I can think of like three or four people who who have done that in the world.
*  And what I would say the burden on you is to learn how to speak enough of the language so that you can ask the experts.
*  Yeah. What their jargon is, jargon is a huge barrier here.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Often one doesn't realize it on either side until you go pretty far into the agreement.
*  It's doable. Just like yourself.
*  Like for a philosopher, right.
*  If you have philosophy audiences who want to do go to a psych lab.
*  That's that's my advice to philosophy.
*  Psychology students sit in a psych lab for a couple of years and just listen and talk with them and you'll learn language.
*  And the same thing is like if you want to learn how to do philosophy as a neuroscientist, go to a philosophy reading group, hang out with philosophers and you'll learn how to speak language.
*  Yeah, this is a recurring theme now on the show.
*  John Krakauer talked about the importance of just going to the library one day.
*  Right. And browsing and stuff.
*  But the the constant friction with that is that nobody has time, you know, like to become you say immerse yourself.
*  And that's brilliant on paper.
*  Right. But, you know, I hardly have time to raise my kids when I was doing postdoctoral neuroscience research.
*  Right. Because your resources are there's just so much demand on your resources.
*  So anyway, I got rid of my kids and that helped that.
*  No, but but but I mean, it really is.
*  It's a constant battle of what to focus on.
*  And social media is not the answer.
*  So maybe that's the time that you're on Twitter and Facebook.
*  You should go and and learn stuff.
*  But something like philosophy to really learn it.
*  It's it's a real tall hill to climb.
*  And that has to be the case for every domain.
*  Really these days where we can't be Renaissance men.
*  Like you said, two or three people that you know of that can spread themselves out in a way that's functionally that's functional, essentially.
*  Yeah, I absolutely agree.
*  In fact, I really don't have an answer to that, because, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, even within the field of AI, it's extraordinarily difficult for people to just keep up with what's going on.
*  And but you see, if different parts of academia or research out there in the technical world become siloed in the way that it's likely to do if people don't talk to each other, there are straightforwardly bad consequences of this.
*  I mean, just think about what happened when Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress.
*  It was so clear that almost nobody in that room even understood the basics of of what Zuckerberg was doing.
*  And that's detrimental to, in that case, not just a democracy, but in trying to seriously assess where it might be good for society to try and steer some of these projects, both in neuroscience, I think, and in AI.
*  I don't know if so I mean there are things that can be done about the time commitment, right?
*  And things can be said about that.
*  So, so one of the things is like it's just on a burden of institutions.
*  So, like, for example, it takes a lot of time to co teach a class between two different disciplines.
*  Right. So I think something that universities should do is just is provide course relief for the non co taught classes, so that you just teach less if you co teach a class at one class counts for to provide with Templeton has this really great.
*  Criticism is a Templeton, but like, but, but I, one of the lovely things that they have is a sort of made career money to get course release for a whole year, so that you go and as a philosopher, learn how to do a scientific field.
*  My friends that are there, or would learn, just sit and do neuroscience for a year and learn all the stats.
*  And don't don't you don't publish you don't publish for a year you don't have to.
*  And you just learn something and then your future research is going to be better so it's just deferred like it's still a gratification. Right. You just just don't eat all the cookies right now.
*  And invest in a cookie making machine and then you can make better cookies in a year.
*  And then they will be more delicious and consumed on with the greater citations in.
*  This is a really important question because it's what you know is universities are struggling with.
*  A lot of emphasis on STEM fields, I mean what what are the liberal arts going to do.
*  And I would, you know, of course, you know, in the humanities, it will be a disaster if if the humanities disappeared from universities because, you know, they were under fun little students who want to take them.
*  And I say that with, you know, I love STEM fields.
*  I think they're just great, but they're not everything.
*  And so, you know, the question you're asking, how do these two areas fit together is something I know it's too bad.
*  We've got more time to discuss it. Yeah.
*  But I was just, you know, toss a business idea out there.
*  Maybe we can develop some AI systems to make translation between fields super efficient.
*  Right. So that I have a great system to or a great, a great system to do that.
*  Just be friends with people in other fields and talk with them over dinner and beer and maybe even write papers with them.
*  That's the most efficient way to do it.
*  And the beer is important.
*  The beer is important. Yeah.
*  But we have that we have a well established and very effective method for drawing these kind of disciplinary connections, which is friendship.
*  And that's what I would recommend to someone who's trying to draw these interdisciplinary things is find people in other disciplines that you can talk to and then just talk to them.
*  So, guys, let me ask you one more question and I'll let you go here.
*  So I my background is in experimental science.
*  And as a scientist, I'm never wrong.
*  Are philosophers ever wrong?
*  My real question is, is there an idea that stands out in your mind that you've you've had in the past that you've just gotten wrong or a time that you've really failed?
*  And if so, how did you overcome it and move on?
*  Well, this is going to sound awful.
*  I don't think I actually got anything that was important wrong.
*  I've certainly written my one of my fair share of pages is boring and trivial and irrelevant.
*  But I I do spend a long, long time on papers and books.
*  I really want to get right.
*  Because as soon as this goes out to the world, there will be philosophers who think, whoa, this is a guy unselfconscious about his own work.
*  The easy, easy answer, Paul, is just coming on this podcast.
*  But I'll let you I'll let you say you've got nothing wrong.
*  Thank you.
*  But no, it sounds horribly self-serving, but I think I can't think of anything about that.
*  That's that's that's actually wrong.
*  No, maybe maybe you're too old such that your memory is not good enough that you can't remember being wrong.
*  Right.
*  It might be people trying to persuade me that it's all wrong.
*  So I think that there's there's a sort of I'm going to sidestep the question in a very philosophy way.
*  So I think that there's different ways of dealing with being wrong in academic work.
*  So when you are wrong about something and I think that this like and this is part of the reason why I think philosophy can be so frustrating for non philosophers is that sometimes being wrong about like a case or something like that or about a detail.
*  What that pushes you to do is revise the view a little bit.
*  And that's a that's a process that we jokingly I don't know if this is this term is actually insulting or not.
*  But the philosophers refer to as chiseling because Roderick Chisholm did this a lot in his papers.
*  He would come up with counter examples and then revise his definition a little bit and then come up with another counter example and revise his definition a little bit.
*  That's called moving that moving the goalposts in common.
*  Right. But I don't think it's moving the goalposts.
*  I think it's getting closer to the truth is that sometimes what you like philosophy works best in this sort of what one term for is reflected equilibrium where you start off with a theory and then you think about edge cases that don't work in that theory and you either sort of explain the edge cases away or revise your model a little bit.
*  And some of the things that I think I'm most right about now have come from just someone gives a counter example and I think, oh no, I'm just completely wrong.
*  So intentional mind wandering is a good one. Right. When I first read about this stuff from from Paul Sully, it was still an dissertation.
*  I read it and I was like, oh, well, guess I'm wrong.
*  And then I realized, no, actually, I think these two things are compatible.
*  Paul is talking about something that's orthogonal to what I'm talking about.
*  And I think some of the best stuff that I'm doing right now has come from realizing that limitation of my earlier framework and changing the framework.
*  So it might look like I'm moving the goalposts, but I don't think it is.
*  I think it's just like getting closer to what I think is the truth about the phenomenon.
*  I want to add something to what Zach said.
*  I think philosophers in general are not good at admitting that they're wrong.
*  I've certainly been guilty of that.
*  Just philosophers?
*  But myself.
*  Because one of the great things about science and mathematics is that by and large, it's pretty clear when your hypothesis or proof or whatever is wrong.
*  It's not so obvious in philosophy.
*  And now I'm at a fairly advanced stage in my career.
*  I'm really good at spotting advanced philosophers who come and give talks and get a question that is clearly something that they can't deal with or shows that their view is wrong and start engaging in professional maneuvers to avoid having to say that.
*  And it's a terrible, terrible intellectual trait.
*  A skill.
*  A skill.
*  No, it's not good.
*  In the same way that if you're teaching a class and a student, as they do here, point out that that can't be right, you've got to say, oh, yeah, what I just said is wrong because you're conveying an awful message to someone.
*  And yeah, both of us just said that we've never been wrong.
*  Yeah, no, I know.
*  Paul's suggesting that if you ever are wrong, you might be willing to admit it.
*  I hear anybody who's listening to this podcast to send me some reasons why something I've said is wrong and I will listen to it.
*  All right, so let me just write a note here in my diary, dear diary philosophers, still slippery sons of bitches.
*  Not all of them.
*  I really enjoyed this time.
*  I wish we had more because we could go on and on.
*  I know.
*  But I really appreciate you coming on the show and wish you both continued success with your with your work.
