# BI 130 Eve Marder: Modulation of Networks
**Brain Inspired:** [March 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGzsnDep4H8)
*  The trick of working in any system is to recognize which particular parts of what you find are
*  idiosyncratic and which parts are hints at or ways into general principles.
*  And I think the most effective scientists are the ones who really have learned to distinguish
*  between preparation idiosyncrasies and big picture ideas.
*  The problem that most preoccupies me now is trying to understand how all these perturbations
*  that an animal sees or goes through, how they leave traces that can be completely
*  cryptic until you stress it. That means you're getting perfectly normal-looking rhythms,
*  but there are things that have changed that you don't reveal until you give
*  another strong perturbation and you realize it's different.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Eve Marder runs the Marder Lab at Brandeis University, where she studies the modulation
*  of neural networks. She's my guest today. Hi everyone, I'm Paul. Eve's name and work
*  almost always comes up when discussing the challenge of understanding how large networks
*  of neurons or units in the case of deep learning produce the cognitive functions and behaviors
*  we're interested in explaining in terms of those networks. The reason why her name always comes up
*  is because of her work on a rather small network of neurons. It happens to be in the stomach of
*  crabs and lobsters, the stomatogastric nervous system. These are networks of about 30 neurons,
*  with the types of neurons and their connections well mapped out and the neurophysiological
*  properties of the neurons well understood. This STG network produces rhythmic or oscillatory
*  outputs important for the life of the crab or lobster. The network manages to function
*  under a wide range of sets of parameters, under a wide range of environmental conditions.
*  One thing this means is that nervous systems are robust and resilient, which of course is a good
*  thing, but it also means it's nearly impossible to look at a network and infer how it's producing
*  its output. And if that's the case for a network of 30 neurons, what hope do we have with networks
*  of millions of neurons? So her work, for example, raises concerns about the time and energy and money
*  being spent to map out connectomes, the structures of neural networks, in the hopes that the structure
*  will tell us all about its function. As Eve says, the structure is necessary to understand function,
*  but absolutely insufficient. So we discussed that, we discussed factors that contribute to
*  network resilience, like homeostasis, plus how even though the networks are resilient,
*  they start to fail in different ways when they're pushed into different modes, and how this could be
*  bad under conditions of climate change or trauma and other challenges that cause underlying changes
*  in the network that we can't appreciate until it's too late. You can learn more in the show notes
*  at braininspired.co.uk, slash podcast slash 130. And on the website, you can also choose to support
*  the podcast through Patreon, and join the Discord community, where we discuss topics from the episodes,
*  and we're also having more regular live zoom discussions about neuro AI type topics. So check
*  that out at braininspired.co. I'd been wanting to have Yvonne for a long time. So I was grateful to
*  finally be in her presence. Enjoy. How much of a problem is it? Well, first of all, do you consider
*  yourself a famous neuroscientist? I'm probably a moderately famous neuroscientist. Okay. There are
*  people who are more famous than I am. And there are people who are not as famous as I am. Within
*  certain circles, I'm probably pretty famous. But in terms of the lay world, I'm probably not so much.
*  Well, right. Would you consider within the neuroscience world, would you consider yourself
*  or prefer to consider yourself famous or legendary? If you had to choose?
*  I wouldn't want to choose. It has a lot of meaning. Yeah. Well, does that kind of status though,
*  that's chosen for you, I suppose. But you're just incredibly busy. And with that kind of status
*  comes lots of responsibilities. Did you ever want all these responsibilities of having to do silly
*  podcasts like you're doing right now, etc? Hopefully, this will not be a silly podcast.
*  Hopefully, this will be an educational podcast. I do these things now in the hopes of maintaining
*  some amount of excitement and imagination and optimism in the younger generation.
*  That's precisely why I do them. I hear from students fairly often saying,
*  I heard this and it made me want to do neuroscience. That's why I did them.
*  Well, that's good. You're going out to the right people today then, hopefully.
*  You've done tons and tons of work on the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system.
*  We're going to talk a little bit about that work and the implications and so on.
*  Before we do that, though, I'm curious how you would characterize how your interests have
*  changed over your career. Did you begin thinking that you're going to be working on a relatively
*  quote unquote simple part of the nervous system like this? Or did you always have
*  or did you start off with a broader picture in mind? And then like many scientists,
*  the questions become narrower and narrower, although the implications of your work are gigantic.
*  I actually think I've been fairly steady in terms of the kinds of problems that interest me.
*  As an undergraduate, I was quite fascinated by what was then the popular topic of
*  denervation supersensitivity, which looked at the role of activity and neurotransmitter on
*  receptor number and localization. So I always was attracted to things that the interface between
*  activity and cellular molecular regulation and synapses and neurons there was that muscles.
*  I have a fairly well-developed sense that we can come back to this later, but I think it's a
*  very important theme, which is I have to work on something which has enough or a little enough
*  ambiguity so that I can understand what the problems are. And I think in neuroscience,
*  people I like to sometimes think about people as fractionating themselves on a gradient of how
*  much ambiguity they can tolerate. And there are some people who can only work on single proteins
*  and other people can only work on consciousness. And we all sort of search the level that's most
*  comfortable. And I run into problems when I start thinking about large numbers of neurons.
*  I don't add about them. Well, okay, so you're more comfortable with a smaller degree of ambiguity,
*  but some of the implications that your work has revealed seems to put you in a higher realm of
*  ambiguity given and we'll talk about what those are. But do you feel like, I mean, it's still like
*  a 30 or so neuron system structurally that you're working on. But no, there's a difference between
*  the ambiguity of what you're doing and understanding the general principles that you find. So my goal
*  has always been to use a small number of neurons that can be identified, recorded from those
*  dynamics can be described carefully, and then use those to try and look for general principles.
*  Because I think often when you have large numbers of neurons, it can be very difficult to see the
*  general principles, because they're hidden in all sorts of other complications. So the trick is to
*  work at a level of ambiguity that still has enough mystery in it, so you can learn new things.
*  But that is well enough to find, so you can find those general principles.
*  And I just like to say going forward, the trick of working in any system is to recognize
*  which particular parts of what you find are idiosyncratic, and which parts are sort of
*  hints at or ways into general principles. And I think the most effective scientists are the ones
*  who really have learned to distinguish between, you know, preparation idiosyncrasies,
*  and big picture ideas.
*  Very good. Well, let's talk a little bit about what you do. So you have fishermen who will not
*  tell you where they fish, deliver crustaceans to your lab. Why is this just a fisherman thing,
*  because they don't want to get it's a competitive industry, and they don't want to give away the
*  location? Fishermen never tell anybody where they're, their catch, right? So the fishermen
*  go out into the ocean, and they're very brave. And they've been doing this very difficult,
*  hard job for a long time. Is it hard? Fishing for any North Atlantic Ocean?
*  Don't they use cages though? And then they just go bring up the cages?
*  They go out in small boats in the cold and the dark, and the waves and the winds and the storms.
*  And they are incredibly brave to fight the elements. And often they have to work very
*  hard for not much return. So yes, I have total admiration. Haven't you actually ever seen
*  the movies of the storms battering the fishing boats and people hanging on for
*  for dear life or being blown overboard?
*  Oh, that's just Hollywood, right?
*  No, that's the real world. And actually in the North Atlantic on the seacoast,
*  in Gloucester and up to the coast of Maine and down through Bedford and all of these
*  seagoing villages where fishing was a time-honored profession. There are many people who were lost.
*  I mean, it's not uncommon that boats are lost and the Coast Guard actually rescues a fair
*  bit, a fair number of people from capsized vessels. So anyway, on the happy note, the
*  fishermen go out and then they bring their catch in and eventually the catch goes to some sort of
*  distributor. We don't buy them directly from the fishermen, but we buy them from seafood distributors,
*  in our case, one of them right on the waterfront in Boston, right outside of Chinatown.
*  And we get them from there. And in usual days, we call them up and they pack them in a box and call
*  a taxi and the taxi brings them out to the lab because we're about 10, 12 miles to the west
*  of Boston. In bad days, we go and get them from the distributor.
*  Oh, I see. So why is it important to, well, have you considered having a facility where you raise
*  them and breed them? I don't know anything about breeding and raising crustaceans, but-
*  Clearly.
*  It's tough, huh?
*  Yeah, clearly. The lobsters, legal, the minimum size lobsters are five to seven years old. And the
*  crabs that we use, which are also adults, are also multi-year old. And lobsters, for a while,
*  we used to raise from embryos to small juveniles in the lab. They're incredibly difficult to raise.
*  Crabs are pelagic, which means they swim freely in the ocean. So I don't know of anybody who's
*  actually raising crabs in a laboratory environment. So I naively thought that your primary reason for
*  doing it that way was so that they would have an ecologically valid life, essentially, and have
*  been exposed to natural environments. Well, you can say that's why.
*  Okay, good. I will.
*  But that's one obvious advantage of working out wild-caught animals. They've had a full, rich,
*  and probably difficult for some of them, life out there in the wild. But additionally,
*  they're slow-growing animals. And so it's not a fun thing to imagine raising enough animals that
*  take five to seven years to reach full size before you study them.
*  I don't even know what would be more expensive. It seems like keeping them in a lab would be more
*  expensive, perhaps, than just purchasing them. Absolutely.
*  No doubt. It's not even in the same ballpark. Okay, yeah. So you get these crustaceans, lobsters,
*  and most recently crabs, mostly, right? Or do you still...?
*  We work on both, but a lot of the stuff we do now is on crabs.
*  And then you prepare their stomatogastric nervous system, which means you dissect it out,
*  right? And the reason you like that preparation is because it has around 30 neurons. And like
*  you were saying, you like low ambiguity, and it's a very well-defined system. And this is
*  sort of an oscillatory rhythmic system involved in digestion, right?
*  Right. So it's an example of what's called the central pattern generator. That's a group of
*  neurons that produces rhythmic motor patterns. And in the case of the stomatogastric nervous system,
*  the ganglion itself has about 26 neurons in crabs, about 30 neurons in lobsters. And each neuron can
*  be individually identified on the basis of its projection to the muscles of the stomach. And it's
*  the ease of identification and the ease of being able to record from all of them simultaneously
*  that makes it such an ideal preparation. Do you worry that... I mean, there's a lot of
*  concern now or hype around having ecological validity in scientific preparations, right?
*  And so when you dissect that out, do we consider it still ecologically valid,
*  even though it's not part of the rest of the functioning organism?
*  Well, since this preparation was first studied in the 1970s, late 60s, early 1970s, some of
*  the earliest work involved putting electrodes in the intact animal, in the muscles, and then later
*  the nerves. And it turns out that the motor patterns that are produced in the intact animal
*  resemble very, very closely what we see in the dissected nervous system.
*  So the other reason why this preparation was so attractive 50 or 60 years ago was precisely
*  because the dissected fictive motor patterns, as they're called, are so close to the actual motor
*  patterns in the alive animal that people found comfort that they could study the mechanisms that
*  were likely relevant to what was happening in the animal just because the patterns resembled.
*  So resembled, the two sets of patterns resembled each other so closely.
*  And do you still agree with that?
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. We've gone back every now and then to do work in vivo,
*  and nothing has given us pause. Most recently, in 2014, we published a paper that involved
*  in vivo recordings and in vitro recordings and comparing the two, and they were very, very
*  similar.
*  Okay, good. Yeah. So let's talk about the conundrum that you have thrown neuroscience into
*  with these long series of experiments that you've performed. So in principle, neuroscience has long
*  thought, right, that as long as if we have a circuit wiring diagram, we can say something
*  about the function of the circuit. And I'm going as big picture as I can here, and we can
*  narrow it down as we go, I suppose. But a large part of what your results suggest is that you
*  can't look at a wiring diagram and say almost anything about its function. Would that be an
*  accurate summary?
*  Um, not quite. I would turn it around a little bit and say, by 1980, we had a wiring diagram
*  for the stomach-astric nervous system. And people and they were wiring diagrams for a number of
*  other small nervous systems, central pattern generators. And it was pretty clear that they
*  were all different, even though some of the motor patterns they produce were pretty similar.
*  Some of the initial early workers were very upset because they thought that there'd be a
*  sort of generic central pattern generator connectivity that would work for all animals.
*  And they were sort of disappointed when that turned out not to be true. I never expected it
*  to be true. So I didn't understand why they were disappointed. But I think what we've been
*  going through in the 40 or something years that we've been post connectome, if you will,
*  we have learned that the connectome or the wiring diagram, as we used to call it,
*  is absolutely necessary and completely insufficient. So you can't understand how a
*  sickle works without a wiring diagram. Because the wiring diagram, even though it doesn't
*  necessarily tell you exactly how it's going to work, it constrains the kinds of things that can
*  arise. So it says here, the wiring diagram gives you a set of possibilities. And then you have to
*  understand how those possibilities get turned into actuals. Because not everything is possible.
*  Not everything is possible.
*  But in a system of 30 well-defined neurons connected with well-defined levels of
*  neurotransmitters, ion channels within some range, although it's a fairly wide range,
*  I understand, that set of possibilities is vast, right?
*  Yes and no. It's always the case that there are lots of different motor patterns that can be
*  produced. But they're all explicable. And I think that's the key feature. They really don't
*  transgress. I mean, when you start seeing motor patterns that are enough different,
*  you know that something's broken.
*  That's often what you spend your time doing is trying to crash the system, right? To push it
*  to its limits. Right. And the system is extremely stable. It's actually fairly hard to crash them.
*  Is that frustrating or is that optimistic and hopeful and amazing?
*  It's optimistic and hopeful. I mean, it tells you that even though each animal has a different set of
*  conductance densities and a different amount of transmitter and whatever, that they found
*  the solution that's good enough for the animals to live out there in the world. And it means that
*  every human, every healthy human has a different brain, but those brains generally allow most of
*  us to breathe and to walk and to run and hopefully to hear and see and think, even though, and you can
*  do that with many different solutions. So I think it's very gratifying to know how the differences
*  do not preclude very similar behavior. So one of my listeners wanted me to ask you
*  what it is that we actually can take from structure. If it's not simply, we can't look the
*  diagram and think, well, that's the function that would come out of that structure. And what you're
*  saying is we can constrain the space of possibilities. Absolutely. You can constrain the space of
*  possibilities. We don't exactly know how that's constrained, but you constrain the space of
*  possibilities and you make some outputs far more probable than others. So if you have reciprocal
*  inhibition, two cells that each inhibit each other, the probabilistic likelihood is that they're
*  going to be firing an alternation or out of phase. Now they can sometimes fire at the same time,
*  but often they won't. Would it be fair to say that there then are motifs that it's a space of
*  possible motifs that we would, is that a way that we can constrain what's possible? So many years
*  ago, Peter getting who was the then leader in the field of small nervous systems in the mid 80s,
*  he was working on a mallis called Tritonia. And he was looking for what he called building blocks,
*  circuit building blocks. So he was looking for either principles at the single cell level or
*  the small circuit level that would have, that would create the library of mechanisms
*  then could be combined to build circuits with many different behaviors. But you would expect that,
*  you know, the transient outward current would usually do X or reciprocal inhibition would
*  usually do Y or bursting neurons could give you certain kinds of behaviors, etc. And so I think
*  he wrote a very beautiful paper, first in 185 and then one in 1989, where he articulated this concept
*  of building blocks, which was his way of articulating the kind of almost the alphabet
*  of how circuits could work. And nothing that's been done since has changed the
*  what he said in 1989 or the way his way of thinking. I mean, people are still using
*  similar kinds of reasoning as they look in in both small and large circuits.
*  So that's going from structure to function. Is there anything that we can say going the opposite
*  way? If you see a function, can you say anything about the structure? So structure is necessary,
*  but not sufficient to understand function. What about the opposite way? I mean, I suppose if you
*  see a rhythmic pattern, there must be a central pattern generator, like structure, right?
*  Yeah, but that could be all different kinds. Yeah, that does, you don't necessarily know how that's
*  built. I think that inverse problem is probably very hard. I think I wouldn't want to try and go
*  in that direction. I think there's a route to a lot of mistakes going in that direction.
*  CB Okay. That's almost a more theoretical direction, I suppose.
*  I mean, theorists would do that. They would say, what would be the likely circuit? I mean,
*  you could take that as theoretical study, you could say, here's a behavior. Now find a circuit
*  that will give you that. And then you could use some sort of genetic algorithm to try and find
*  the best fit to using that. And different people might find very different structures,
*  they could be very different circuits. And then, and then you're forced to say, well,
*  which is the actual one, if you care about that. And this, this goes back to the whole issue of
*  why people do theory, and what they're trying to achieve. If you're trying to build
*  a brain for a robot, it doesn't matter how a nervous system actually does it.
*  If you're trying to understand how a nervous system does it, then it matters a lot how it does it.
*  RG Well, it depends on the kind of brain, the kind of robot you want to build, right? If you
*  want to build an AGI robot, it might matter or it might not. We don't know, right?
*  Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think if you only want to build a robot to do a task,
*  it's not clear to me that you have to be defined by neurobiologically plausible rules.
*  RG How has theory affected you? In some sense, what you do is very bottom up, right? Even by,
*  you know, like running millions of simulations to see what sets of parameters might give rise
*  to similar behaviors. That's kind of a bottom up approach. But has theory,
*  how much has theory inspired your work? Or how much do you dabble in the realm of theoretical
*  principles? Because I ask because these days, in neuroscience, everyone's saying, we need better
*  theory, right? That's what we're missing is great theories. And I'm talking that's generally about,
*  you know, the brains writ large, right? Brain function, grand theory of the brain, etc.
*  But I'm wondering if that applies to your work.
*  I just don't buy into that. I think what theory can give you are very clear answers to how you
*  might build a nervous system to do a given task or set of tasks or switch between a bunch of tasks.
*  I personally don't think we should be looking for the grand theory of the brain.
*  I think we could be looking for a really good model for that explains how the basal ganglia
*  work. I think we could be looking for a pretty good model for how the cerebellum works. I think
*  you'd be looking for a really good model for a lot of things. But I just don't know. I'm sure
*  that people disagree with me. I know that people disagree with me. But I just don't know what a
*  theory of the grand theory of the brain what that would tell you or what it would be, because the
*  brain is doing so many different things with so many different parts. They're all connected to
*  each other. But the rules that you need to get the respiratory centers to work right
*  and to be stable and robust are different from the kinds of rules that you would need to get
*  cortex to store memory. I mean, you might have some of the same molecular components and you
*  probably have learning in the respiratory center as well. But it's just not clear that there'd be
*  some global theory that would give you both respiration and memory of your grandmother from
*  50 years ago. That said, there are some basic pieces of biology that go across. But those tend
*  to be the more basic parts of the cell biology of neurons that are totally general. So for example,
*  if you want to understand what passive channels do, they can do a lot of things, but chances are
*  they can be used to do a lot of things in any neuron that you want to place them. I mean,
*  they function that way. So but that's not what people were talking about the grand theories,
*  the brain are talking about. They're not talking about what is a passive channel doing to
*  electrical excitability. But the thing that we've done that I think is closest to a
*  grand principle goes back to the early 90s, when we were trying to come up with models to explain
*  the dynamics of single neurons. And with Gwendolyn, Larry Abbott, we came up with what became the first
*  homeostatic model to explain intrinsic excitability and the development of intrinsic
*  excitability. And to me, the problem was very, very clear. As a biologist, we already had some
*  measurements of conductance densities. And it was really hard to build a single neuron model that
*  would actually capture the dynamics of the single neuron that data came from. And we realized that
*  to get the model to work right, you had to be tuning not just one kind of ion channel,
*  not two kinds of ion channels, but six or eight kinds of ion channels at the same time.
*  And so it became very clear that no one was thinking about the mechanism that you would
*  need to use to coordinately tune the numbers, the densities of all the channels in a cell.
*  And so that original homeostatic model, which said that neurons had a target excitability level,
*  and then they could regulate the number of ion channels in the membrane accordingly as they
*  drifted away from their target activity pattern. That to me is an example of what I think is a big
*  general principle that every cell in the brain has to solve this problem, have had to control
*  its intrinsic excitability. It doesn't mean that all cells have to use exactly the same roles.
*  But it does mean that if you want a cell to have a certain characteristic buying pattern,
*  that there have to be ways that it can regulate its channel densities to do that. So that's an
*  example that we were trying to build a computational model of an LP neuron in the crab. And we ended up
*  what I think is one of the big picture insights in neuroscience. And if you say, and I believe that
*  any neuron anywhere has to solve this problem. And as I said, it doesn't have to solve the problem
*  exactly the same way, but it has to solve this problem. Just like every animal has other big
*  picture issues it has to solve. Is that a problem that you're trying to solve?
*  Is this where homeostasis plays a large part?
*  That is the homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability. We didn't call it that at the time.
*  We called it activity dependent regulation of connectness. But that it was the first
*  real homeostatic model of connectness. Obviously, we've been talking about homeostasis, the level
*  of big animal physiology. But we just took the concept of a negative feedback and a
*  control loop to the single neuron. Speaking of large theories of the brain,
*  some people think that neuroscience has it all wrong. And that essentially what the brain
*  writ large is one big hierarchical series of control loops, and that we should be applying
*  control theory to study everything. So this would accord with that at least on the single neuron
*  level, essentially. Well, but I mean, I think that's, I don't think there's any intrinsic
*  conflict. Certainly the brain like the body has multiple loops within loops. And, you know, the
*  fascinating thing about biological systems is that they manage to put loops within loops within loops
*  within loops without it crashing all the time, which is not so trivial to start, you know,
*  just doing it as an engineer. But that is what gives rise to the resilience even in something like
*  the STG, right? Right. That's the resilience comes exactly from understanding those sorts of
*  control loops at the lowest level, and then seeing how, how you don't do anything that comes
*  into conflict with those loops. But, you know, I think I'm not saying that control theory is the
*  be all end all. However, it is certainly true that biological systems manage to use these sorts of
*  negative feedback control loops very effectively over large scales in time and space. And, and,
*  and I think biological systems do it much better than engineers do yet.
*  Yet. Oh, D, but you're leaving the future open for the engineers, huh?
*  Yeah, I mean, they, they, they're smart. And the thing is, in the beginning, they were,
*  they were crippled by the fact that the computers they had to work with
*  had limitations. And, you know, right now, they're much less limited by the computational
*  size and scale of what the simulations they can do. So the future lies ahead.
*  I'm thinking about technology since you mentioned it. Let's talk about for whatever example you
*  want. Let's say the basal ganglia, right of a higher primate is would there be let's say,
*  so like the dream is always you can record from all neurons, right? We can't we don't have this
*  technology yet. But let's say in 20 years or something, somehow we can. Would your approach,
*  would you recommend your approach scaled up to something that massive and interconnected?
*  So here's where I have a failure of imagination. Because if someone were to give me recordings,
*  a million cells in the base, what would you do? I wouldn't know what to look for. Yeah.
*  So now there's some very smart people who might run all sorts of different data analysis,
*  algorithms and this and that and the other thing. But what you're looking for would be very hard to
*  see with the raw with your raw eyes. And I may be enough of an old fashioned old lady that
*  it's here's where I say I have problems with the ambiguity that comes with large numbers.
*  If I look at the raw data from any of our preparations, I can always see it in the raw data.
*  And then we do it many, many times that you do complicated data analysis and whatever. But at
*  the end of the day, I have to recover something I can see in the raw data. And in recordings from
*  those data, I don't think I would have the ability to see anything in the raw data.
*  So I would never know if you got it right. What's the raw data in your case? Are you
*  talking about your favorite graph of 2020 with the ionic conductances?
*  That would be one thing or the raw data would just be the spike trains.
*  I consider the rod rate the actual physiological output recordings from the system
*  that shows you what it's doing and when it's doing it. And so I can look at the recordings from
*  the 13 neurons in the stomatogastric ganglion. I can see if I have eight electrodes or so,
*  I can see them all work at the same time. I can see the relationships among them.
*  I might have to use some data analysis to look at in detail at the correlations, whatever,
*  but I can see it all.
*  With the eye roll, I like that.
*  Yeah, but I can see it all. And there's no way I'm going to be able to see those relationships
*  in those million neurons recorded, even if they had tags on them that told me what kinds of neurons
*  they were. So, you know, minimally, you need to have them tagged so you knew who was who.
*  That's difficult. But also, even if you knew who was who,
*  and you know, and you know, other people, you know, people who are 30 years old now,
*  they're going to say, Oh, we'll be able to do this. And maybe they will. But I don't,
*  I don't see it for me. And that's where I said, you know, I get stuck. I get stuck when I try and go to
*  large ensembles of many neurons, because I'm never good. I don't know how I would know that
*  I'd gotten it right. Has your work on the STG has it?
*  changed your viewpoint or changed your mind about any higher cognitive functions? Or has it given
*  you any insights into any higher cognitive functions? Or is that something that you
*  prefer to that you're uncomfortable with the level of ambiguity there as well?
*  No, I think there's some things that I don't know if the work I work on the STG, but I know
*  several things that is that I mean, we know from psychology, and we know from neural network theory,
*  that all memory is reconstructive. And that I think is a really important principle that came from
*  actually theory first. We know from all the cell biology of the neuron, now our work and other
*  people's work, that every ion channel receptor turns over with in minutes, days and weeks.
*  So we have a vision of the brain as constantly rebuilding itself. And the minute you think about
*  the brain is constantly rebuilding itself. And you think about memory and cognitive processes
*  as emergent process of a brain that's constantly in a state of flux. Then you sort of say there's
*  this really, really interesting set of problems. As you think about a brain that's constantly
*  having to rebuild itself, but also having to constantly maintain stable function,
*  and long term memory. And so it's a fast, that's the conundrum. To my mind, that's the conundrum.
*  And I think we see it far more clearly to me, I see that conundrum much more clearly now
*  than 50 years ago. But because we know so much more about cellular mechanisms, and we know so
*  much more about how memory works. But I think that that really to me is the big, big mystery.
*  How you have a brain which is rebuilding itself totally. There's probably not a single
*  potassium channel in my brain today that was there 30 years ago. And yet, I can remember
*  learning north, south, east and west on when my mother had me walking up and down Broadway
*  on the Upper West Side. She taught me then uptown was north and downtown was south and the Hudson
*  was west and Central Park was east. And that was with me when I was three years old. And it's
*  with me now. Is that what you picture when you orient yourself? You picture the avenue?
*  Absolutely. She taught me the principle of maps. She taught me orientation maps with
*  Central Park. But that potassium channel is gone.
*  That map is still there. And so to my mind, and it was a specific incident that my mother taught
*  me that. So I have a memory of her teaching me this. And that memory now, obviously that memory
*  is somehow restored in cells that have completely turned over all their cellular constituents,
*  although many of those neurons are probably still there. So that to me is one of the big
*  imponderables. Why that was such an important memory that I think she was walking with me in
*  the middle of the summer saying, you're north and south. And still very vivid. Probably.
*  But you're reconstructing it right now. I am. But I think I'm probably getting it
*  approximately correct. Unlike many memories, which are not. That one is probably right.
*  So I mean, this in some sense, it must give you your own research, then must give you hope.
*  So thinking about the resilience of the STG system and its adaptability in different
*  environments, where you can get the same rhythm or very similar rhythms. Even if they're different,
*  they're still functionally rhythms out of very different setups, very different sets of
*  parameters. So that must in some sense give you hope that we will be able to have a handle on
*  this sort of thing using that kind of same principle. That's the assumption. Yeah.
*  So it has to be that way, right? Because you can't have. Well, yes, by definition,
*  by definition, you have how many billion neurons in your brain. And most of them are the ones that
*  were there that you were born with. And none of the molecular components are really the same.
*  And it's not an accident that that is your brain and your heart that have these long-lived cells
*  that have the same basic problem of maintaining constant. Your heart,
*  again, doesn't turn over cells, but it has to turn over its ion channels and it has to
*  maintain a constant function. It's terrifying to me every time I think about how my heart can
*  never stop or else I will. It really goes for a long time for a long short periods. Well,
*  you know, it can't. Okay. Yeah. Your heart has just to remind you, your heart has so many ways
*  of maintaining its function. They do a very good job speaking about degenerate mechanisms.
*  There are many degenerate mechanisms that keep your heart working.
*  Well, that's good to know. I appreciate you soothing me.
*  I'm not worried about your heart. I'm a little worried about it, but that's okay. I'm aging.
*  One of the things that you have found and among the many, obviously, is in trying to essentially
*  crash the STG system, you've taken crustaceans from warm winters, colder winters, and the
*  variability in the environment leads to a different range of adaptable solutions, right?
*  Yeah. This makes me very sad, by the way.
*  Well, I know that you're concerned about the environment, but go ahead.
*  Well, actually, the first time in 2012, when Sarah had got our first set of recordings from
*  these very warm watered animals, and I talked about them at the FENS meeting,
*  I had a graduate student come up to me and there were tears rolling down her eyes.
*  Saying, oh, climate change and what's going to happen? So the reason it worries me is because
*  we see hidden and cryptically. So if we just were to record control data at 11 degrees,
*  the way we usually do, we would never know that something had changed.
*  And so the problem that most preoccupies me now is trying to understand how all these
*  perturbations that an animal sees or goes through, how they leave traces, that can be completely
*  cryptic until you stress it. But I mean that means you're getting perfectly normal looking rhythms,
*  but there are things that have changed that you don't reveal until you give another strong
*  perturbation and you realize it's different. And so that I think is a big lesson for the human brain
*  that if you have a child or an adult who's perfectly healthy and is not terribly badly
*  stressed but still has lots and lots and lots of experiences and maybe some bad experiences,
*  you don't necessarily know that there have been some long lived changes in the brain until you
*  come in and this is the way I think about PTSD. You come in with a very bad stressor,
*  someone has seemingly recovered, you don't know what's hidden. There are cryptic changes
*  that are only revealed when you come back in with the stress or something similar to the stress
*  that evokes these changes. So this is a problem I think is a really, really deep problem for
*  understanding animals and humans and how populations crash and don't crash and how
*  humans, individual humans crash and don't crash. And I think for example, just to riff,
*  I don't think we're going to know for quite a while what these two years of COVID crap have done
*  to us, much less our kids, but I mean to us even. They've changed all sorts of ways that we have
*  within the world. On the other hand though, I mean, one of the optimistic takeaways from your work
*  is the amount, the incredible adaptability that organisms do have, right? I was going to ask you
*  about evolution and your view on the fantastic mechanism or fantastic phenomenon of evolution.
*  What you were just saying makes me think that you are currently thinking that we're almost
*  walking our way into a tighter constraint of the possibilities of our adaptability,
*  right? And so maybe we started out with this really wide range of adaptability in a perfect
*  environment, but then by putting these different stressors, the climate change, et cetera,
*  it narrows the space of possibilities. I don't know. One of the things that we're trying to figure
*  out at a study now is to ask the question, if you have an organism that is very resilient to
*  stressor one, to perturbation one, will it be necessarily more or less resilient to a different
*  perturbation? So you can imagine that to be very resilient to temperature, you have to pay the price
*  to be less resilient to salinity or less resilient to pH. Or maybe there's a hierarchy of, you know,
*  it's more important to be resilient to one thing than to the other. So what we're trying to do now
*  is to set up, we try and set up scenarios where we look at multiple stressors, multiple perturbations,
*  then see if there seems to be interaction and see if there appears to be a hard trade-off or whether
*  some animals are just good at everything and or whether or not. So we don't know the answer to that,
*  but I think this goes a lot to the question that you were just asking, which is, are we narrowing
*  possibilities or are we just going down a different path? I mean, so I suspect, I mean, if I had to
*  guess from our earliest data, I would say that the resilience to different stressors is uncorrelated,
*  that you can't necessarily predict whether an animal will be resilient to pH change on the basis
*  of how resilient it is to temperature. Although, of course, in the wild, there's a correlated
*  variables, but that's a separate issue. But that's one of the things that I think remains for us to
*  try and figure out, because that is something that is relevant to how humans deal with all different
*  kinds of environmental stressors. Well, I know that, you know, I think it was a particularly warm
*  winter, for example, and the crustaceans that you were pulling out there showed a higher resilience.
*  They were harder to crash in some respects, right? But then you, the caveat was that you didn't know
*  if those are just the survivors through the evolutionary funnel. Right. So we've had that,
*  we've had that result sort of several times now, really warm winters, giving rise to
*  high crash temperatures. The worst of it is that the water temperature is sliding up.
*  And so in 2012, it was an unusual result, and now it's becoming more usual. So we're now starting
*  to look at, we get data from the NOAA buoy 16 miles out in the ocean for average water temperature,
*  and we plot that against various assembly measures. That's the closest you can get, huh,
*  to knowing how their environment. Yeah, no, where the hell these guys come from,
*  doesn't matter. 16 miles out is, it's not, it's probably reasonable. You need to put a tracker on
*  the, like slip a tracker in the fisherman's pocket, right? So we actually once tried to
*  have a colleague whose son was a lobster fisherman, and we bought a little computerized
*  thing to put on his pots he was supposed to collect for us. And we'd know the temperature,
*  and we'd know when and where and everything. He brought animals in once, then he disappeared
*  with our tracker. Oh, yeah. You know, I guess, you know, 22 year old fishermen are not necessarily
*  reliable. Can't trust them. No. It was not a very expensive device, but I was sorry, he obviously
*  got bored. Yeah, oh, I see. Okay. I mean, but isn't that in some sense, the way evolution works? I
*  mean, is this something to fret over? Or is it something to celebrate that there are lobsters
*  that can survive and thrive? And that this gives rise to the new breed of lobsters when our world
*  is boiling? There'll be there'll still be lobsters that have, you know, survived the evolutionary
*  gauntlet? Yeah. It's hard for me to judge. Boston's gonna be underwater by then. Okay, well,
*  they'll be closer. The crabs will be closer to you then.
*  Yeah, I don't know. I always get nervous when I see things in the wild that are clear indications of
*  either climate change or pollution. So for example, every couple of years, we live on the
*  waterfront. So we have an apartment which is five stories up and looks right out over,
*  we're on pilings, it looks right over the harbor. So we see what's in the harbor a lot. So you know,
*  there are lots of seabirds. And there's, and every now and then in May and June, we get jellyfish.
*  And not every year or sometimes they must do they have we don't see very many of them.
*  Every now and then there's giant infestations. And then they're usually the little,
*  beautiful white ones, the moon jellies. And then not this past year, but the year before,
*  we had these giant really ugly red things, whose name I can't remember. I'm looking at it,
*  we're not supposed to see that. And then that same year, I was looking out one day over the water,
*  and I said, Holy shit, there are all these dead fish, all these dead carp in the water.
*  And what happened is, it was very warm. And their carp in the Charles River, and carp need a really
*  high oxygen level in the water. And the and you know, there's less oxygen in warm water than there
*  is in cold water. So as the water temperature goes up, the oxygen levels go down. And then
*  if algae start growing, the algae eat the oxygen. So there was this giant, giant, giant number of
*  carp who all died at the same time. And some of them were washing underneath. And I look at that,
*  and I said, This is not good. Yeah, I don't like seeing dead carp in the harbor.
*  Or ugly big red things, I guess.
*  I know, nor ugly big red things. These were really ugly. So, and there was this. So, you know,
*  you see it, right? Just like, you know, you see the giant fires in the west coast,
*  it's not supposed to be happening like that. So, you know, you just don't like it.
*  Well, of course not. Well, and you're working toward helping change it, correct? So yeah,
*  you're doing your part. I'm not doing my part. You're doing your part.
*  Yeah. What kind of car do you drive?
*  It's a Subaru. It's a Colorado cockroach is what it's called.
*  No, but I have a new one, which is a plug in hybrid.
*  Yeah, great. You're taking you're taking my parking spots up here in Colorado. But no,
*  no. Yeah, the the plugins always get the best those in the handicap.
*  They're always the best spots these days. Well, there's a lot there's a lot of Tesla's and
*  electric cars out here. Yeah. So, but anyway, so that's that's that.
*  I'm just curious what you if you have an opinion on the current hype or boom explosion
*  in deep learning and using deep learning models to help understand brains.
*  I think we'll survive it.
*  Okay. Is it it's a poisonous big red thing, in other words.
*  I don't know. I mean, I so there's this giant, giant fad. Yeah, now, it will eventually
*  winnow itself out. So there will be some very important advances that we will get that benefit
*  from that way of thinking and those technologies. And they will have thrown into the universe,
*  a lot of not very interesting papers along the way. And I can't tell the difference yet.
*  Yeah. So in 10 years, you'll know what what really important work came from that.
*  So one of the latest trends is using dynamical systems theory, you know, to talk about manifolds,
*  so that you can reduce the dimension and talk about what's going on in a large population of
*  neurons. Do you see that as a promising way forward in scaling up from something like a 30
*  neuron thing to a billion neuron thing? Maybe. Okay. Since I don't think well about large
*  numbers, I, I, I can't map, I can't map those very abstract manifolds back onto real, real things.
*  So if other people can and it helps them, great. But I don't know.
*  Last question, Eve, I appreciate you hanging on with me here. Has your career turned out the way
*  that you envisioned it? And if not, how has it been different than what you envisioned?
*  I didn't actually envision it. Maybe that's the best way. I just kept on going a year or two at
*  a time. I actually had no. So five years from now, you don't know what you're going to be doing.
*  Well, five years from now, there are three possibilities. One is I'll be dead.
*  Possibility two is I'll still be working or possibly three. I'll have stopped working.
*  Climate change stalwart, climate change leader.
*  Nah. Okay. I don't have that much political activism in me at that level anymore.
*  Yeah. Yeah. A lot of energy for that.
*  In five years, hopefully I'll be driving an electric car so you won't get on my case about
*  what I drive. Well, but my husband, of course,
*  are worried about what we have to do in the environment to get the things that you need
*  to build batteries. So in five years, we may decide that the battery technology
*  is really bad in different ways in the environment. So I guess we have to go find another planet.
*  Forward we go. I love that solution, however, like to expand into space. But that's another hour,
*  I suppose. That's also a very sad solution because it means we've just destroyed our planet.
*  Well, it doesn't have to. I think we should go anyway, destroy or not destroy.
*  We should go anyway. But hopefully the young ones will do that.
*  Thank you so much for your time, Eva. I really appreciate it.
*  Thank you. Bye bye.
