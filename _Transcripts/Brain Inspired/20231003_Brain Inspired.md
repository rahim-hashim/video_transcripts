# BI 175 Kevin Mitchell: Free Agents
**Brain Inspired:** [October 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klj0ZnmPtu8)
*  Then what does that mean for free will? Am I really making decisions? Am I really in
*  charge or am I just a pre-configured, pre-programmed kind of meat puppet?
*  The self disappears in that view. Any sort of system that you would think has ultimate
*  freedom and is not constrained in any way by prior causes is just a random behavior
*  That's not a self. If you get all of that and it's doing it in a way that we think is adaptive
*  and appropriate, then I think you might have artificial general intelligence. But in order
*  to do that, you may have to have made an agent. This is Brain Inspired. Hey everyone, I am Paul.
*  You'll have to bear with me here in this little introduction. I am a little bit loopy. I just came
*  back from Europe and I developed a cold, have some jet lag, so I apologize. But I guess that's what
*  happens when you travel the world, if the world is one place in Europe for three or four days.
*  My guest today is from the world. Kevin Mitchell is back. Kevin is a professor of genetics at
*  Trinity College Dublin. I said he's back. He's been on the podcast before, back on episode 111
*  with Eric Howell. And during that episode, we talked a little bit about his previous book,
*  which was called Innate, How the Wiring of Our Brains Shape Who We Are. Today he's back to discuss
*  his new book called Free Agents, How Evolution Gave Us Free Will. So I won't say much here about
*  about because we discussed that right in the beginning of the episode. And we talked about
*  what led Kevin to write this latest book off of the heels of his previous book. But I will say
*  in the beginning here that the book is very well written, just like Innate was. And it is at the
*  level where a lay audience could attack it and get just as much out of it as an expert in
*  developmental biology or neuroscience or likewise other sciences. So if our conversation leads you
*  into confusing corners of your mind today, just know that he spells everything out in the book
*  very well. And of course, we don't touch on everything in the book today. But the basic
*  premise of the book is that we have free will. And that is due to our agency, which has evolved
*  and complexified through the course of evolution ever since the beginning of agency, which was the
*  beginning of life. And part of what Kevin writes about is the idea of the indeterminate universe,
*  that the universe is fundamentally indeterminate at the quantum level, or whatever lowest level
*  you choose to think about. And it's that indeterminacy that gave rise to the capacity
*  for free will, in essence, because it gave rise to processes that can constrain themselves and lead
*  to life, lead to agency, complexify over evolution, lead to free will.
*  Okay, so I'll leave it at that in this what's becoming a rambling introduction. So I apologize
*  for that. But I had a lot of fun speaking with Kevin. I hope you enjoy the conversation.
*  I linked to the book and Kevin's website and the show notes at braininspired.co
*  podcast slash 175. A special thank you to my Patreon supporters. Guys, I know that I've slowed
*  down recently in releasing episodes. And that's because I got a real job and I'm still figuring
*  out the new schedule. But I'm picking up the steam again and should be back on track for a more
*  regular schedule. So thank you for sticking with me. And thank you, as always, for your support.
*  And by the way, this episode comes on the heels of my previous episode with Alicia Juarero,
*  where we talked a lot about constraints and biological organization, and how the modern
*  notion of causation is not sufficient to explain and understand complex systems.
*  And so Kevin and I touch on a lot of those points a lot as well. And he visits those ideas in his
*  book as well. So if you enjoyed the last conversation with Alicia, I'm sure that you'll enjoy
*  this conversation with Kevin. Thanks for being here. Here's Kevin. So we're recording now, I
*  guess. So I was happy to get a physical copy, which is so nice to read. Yeah, backwards for you.
*  Oh, no, I can see that. Yeah, that looked good. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's so nice to thumb through.
*  Is this what it's going to look like? I guess there are different versions and different.
*  The new cover, actually, that's not the final version.
*  Okay, maybe I shouldn't. I'll blur that out then for folks.
*  It looks very similar to that.
*  So free agents. Welcome back. Nice to see you, Kevin.
*  Thank you. Thank you for having me. And yeah, great to be back. Nice to see you, too.
*  So you've written another greatest hit here. Your last book, when did innate come out? 2012?
*  No, it was 2018.
*  Eight. Wait, it was that? Oh, yeah. Okay. I was thinking it was 2017, actually. And then I just
*  did a little poor math in my head. Wow. So that's pretty fast turnaround for a book. But in some
*  ways, innate was a precursor to free agents. Yeah, in a funny way.
*  So innate is about how our brains get wired and the idea that we're not blank slates, that we have
*  some innate predispositions, behavioral tendencies and capacities. So our own sort of individual
*  nature, not just human nature generally. And that arises due to differences in our genetics
*  and differences in the way our brain actually develops, just the way the actual run of
*  development turns out. So yeah, in giving talks about that topic, I would often get this question
*  at the end, which is like, hang on a second now. If you're saying my brain is sort of wired a
*  certain way, and that affects my behavior, and I didn't have any choice over my genes or the way
*  my brain developed, then what does that mean for free will? Am I really making decisions? Am I
*  really in charge? Or am I just a pre-configured, pre-programmed kind of meat puppet? And that's a
*  very valid concern. And that's what got me thinking much more deeply about the problem of free will
*  and whether there's a framework that we can think of, in which we can think of free will in a more
*  naturalized way. Because of course, there's that problem, which I call sort of biological fatalism,
*  that we're just configured a certain way, we can't do anything about it. And then there's a bunch of
*  more deep sort of metaphysical problems of physical determinism or reductionism. And those are all
*  things that I started thinking about and considering this book. So was it like the seventh or eighth
*  time that you were asked about free will? Like, and you're rolling your eyes and thinking, oh,
*  this is pointing me in the direction I have to go? Or had you, I mean, I know you'd already been
*  thinking, everyone's thinking about free will all the time. Well, they are. So I mean, there's the
*  sort of impetus from considering behavioral genetics, literature. But then there's also
*  an impetus just from neuroscience these days. And I think many neuroscientists, because
*  paradoxically, we're making so much progress, where you can do these amazing experiments,
*  especially in animals, you can go in with optogenetics, you can tweak this circuit or
*  activate those neurons, you can make the animal, you know, move left, move right, roll over, go to
*  sleep, wake up, hunt, mate, all kinds of things. And you can get into the cognitive circuits, you
*  know, you can make it perceive something or believe something you can implant a memory,
*  you can make it more or less confident in its beliefs, you know, you can really get in there.
*  And I think it feels like the more we do that, the more it looks just like neural mechanism,
*  like that's all there is. And there may be a tendency, I think, that rather than explaining
*  how cognition works, we're explaining it away. It's like it's just circuits firing, the whole
*  beliefs, desires, intention stuff is kind of epiphenomenal. And, you know, many neuroscientists,
*  I think, come to the conclusion that we really are just complicated machines. And certainly,
*  there's various people out there making that case that that means, you know, that
*  because we can see the neural circuits at work, when we're making a decision,
*  they would say, your neural circuits are making the decision. Right, I would say you're using your
*  neural circuits, you're making the decision. And that's just the machinery you use to do it. But
*  there's two different ways to see that. And so that that current of neural reductionism is pretty
*  strong at the moment. And that was another sort of impetus for me to write this book,
*  because I don't think that view is right. And I wanted to push back on that a little bit because
*  it ultimately has some dark connotations, frankly. Yeah. Do you think that?
*  Again, I saw I've mentioned this before. I mean, you write about things like process philosophy
*  in the book and treating organisms as a whole instead of like their parts. And so this kind of
*  trajectory of thinking seems like it's kind of coming to the fore again. I mean, are we do you
*  think that we're on the cusp of some sort of shift in how we think about these things? Or am I just
*  in that tiny niche that you're also in? Well, I don't know. I hope so. And it's funny, I think
*  that, you know, it may be these philosophies will come back just because we need a way of thinking
*  about systems level holistic level stuff, because we can now do systems level holistic level
*  experiments and analysis, right? When we couldn't when all we could do is record some, you know,
*  do LTP on a few neurons in a hippocampal slice, or, you know, record a couple of neurons in an animal
*  or something like that. Which is still valuable, we should say it's like when people are going to
*  criticize modern deep learning, they're like, it's very impressive. But it's very, it takes an
*  approach of isolating one component of a system at a time. And it gives a kind of an impression
*  of a mechanism driving a behavior where it's like this little part of the machine, when this happens,
*  that happens, and so on. So it's a little bit I think of an illusory perspective. But now we can
*  do you know, we can do recordings from 10s of 1000s of animals in awake behaving animals. Sorry,
*  10s of 1000s of neurons. Yeah. And, and we therefore have to have some way to deal with that,
*  right. And so there's all this sort of interesting computational stuff thinking about like,
*  manifolds and dimensionality reduction and trying to see what is it within all that information
*  that's actually causally important and meaningful. And generally, it's a big sort of pattern, right,
*  it's not the low level details. And, and it's the flux of those patterns through time. And it's the
*  way those patterns are interpreted in other parts of the brain, and so on. So you get this very
*  holistic kind of approach that you can't just reduce it to a kind of a driving motive force of
*  like a reflex. And that I think lends itself much better to process philosophy thinking to more
*  holistic systems thinking and like holistic has a bad name. It sounds really rude. It sounds like
*  mysticism, right. And even process philosophy is like, oh, everything's in flux, man. It's all
*  changed. Nothing is you know, it's it sounds very vague and nebulous. And I think a lot of scientists
*  don't think it's scientific. But but I think like yourself, I think we're moving in that direction.
*  And I feel like the process philosophy and the sort of relational philosophy is going to come to the
*  fore, just oddly driven by right, the need to think about our the experimental data that we will now
*  be able to get. Right. It's like that, that reductionist approach gave birth gave rebirth
*  to these sorts of ideas in some way. Yeah. And they're old ideas, right? I mean, they're
*  everything's an old idea. Well, we'll talk about whether anything can actually be new later, perhaps.
*  But but I mean, yeah, these like, it's impressive how old ideas continue to kind of recirculate.
*  Yeah. And there were people like, you know, Whitehead and Bergson, and the start of the
*  20th century that, you know, there were big movements there towards this. And, and, and later
*  on, just in thinking about system stuff, not so much philosophy, but thinking about, you know,
*  cybernetics, say, as a movement. Yeah, it was, it was huge for a while. And then it kind of faded
*  away. But I think that's going to come back as well. Because I think, you know, principles of
*  control theory, as a broad, as a broad sort of way of thinking about things, especially thinking
*  about the brain is going to be much, much more useful and more relevant. Yeah. Well, I mean,
*  yeah, so you started that started your thoughts off talking about these philosophies. And in fact,
*  I just had a conversation the other day with someone. And I was telling them, well, now I
*  have like a process philosophy kind of approach to things. And he was like, Oh, okay, well,
*  what does that mean? What does that do? You know, and I was like, Oh, shit, I can't, I don't know,
*  man. You know, but, but where was I going with this? Oh, yeah. So so but the question for me is,
*  like, well, how do I marry these perspectives with like a scientific approach? And I mean,
*  do you think that things like control theory and dynamical systems are steps in that direction?
*  Absolutely. I mean, they are underpinned, whether they're whether it's obvious or not,
*  they're underpinned by some, you know, more holistic philosophies. I mean, they are just about,
*  they're really a science of organization. So it's anti reductive to its core, when you think about
*  dynamical systems, thinking about control theory, you know, information theory, hierarchy theory,
*  all of those sorts of what we call systems, science system thinking are non reductive.
*  There, they tend to be, you know, focused on dynamical principles, how things change or don't
*  change through time. And also how, you know, how you get sort of causal effectiveness within a
*  complex system. And so yeah, there are scientific theories that we can avail of that are actually
*  already many of them existing and again, also sort of being rediscovered. You don't have to
*  go all the way down the philosophical rabbit hole if you don't want to these things cash out
*  in in very real, practical terms. Yeah. Okay, I've already we've already gone down like a bunch of
*  rabbit hole here. It's not going to be the last. No, but let me take us back just because I did,
*  you know, this is a lot for someone kind of just coming into this introductory, I suppose. And I
*  was going to ask you, so you write so well, and you're very thorough and clear. And both in innate
*  and in free agents, you know, you really go step by step and kind of build up the story. And then,
*  and I found, well, this is a very enjoyable read. And I'm not having to strive too hard to understand
*  the concepts and stuff and connect things. And I'm just curious, like when you're writing who
*  you're writing for? Yeah. That's a really great question. And one of the things that's tricky in
*  writing the kind of book, you know, like innate and free agents is they're sort of pitched, they're not
*  like real academic. They're in between. They're not fully trade books where it's supposed to be
*  kind of just, you know, entertainment almost, right? You know, they're difficult concepts,
*  right? And so I'm trying to explain those to basically the educated public generally. So the
*  way I think about it, and actually the people I have in mind, if I'm ever sort of wondering about
*  it is my parents. So my parents are well educated, but they're not specialists in these areas. And
*  I feel like if I can explain the gist of these things to them, then I've done my job. And, you
*  know, they might not get all the details like any other reader might not get all the details, and
*  that's fine. So yeah, that's my target audience, really. Now, as it happens, you know, these things
*  are, they're pretty interdisciplinary. They span a lot of areas. And I already had found, for example,
*  even in blogging, that say writing about the intersection of genetics and neuroscience,
*  having to explain genetics to neuroscientists is in some ways like having to explain genetics to
*  the educated general public. You can't assume the basic detailed knowledge and the same vice versa.
*  So I think we're also specialized that for many, many topics, we are just even scientists are just
*  the educated general public when it comes to some science that they don't know about.
*  Yeah, yeah, I know. I tell everyone like watching some 60 minutes thing about neuroscience, I'm
*  like, it's all wrong. But then, you know, but it's so easy to you want to believe it. And then if I
*  watch a 60 minutes thing about nuclear physics, physics or something, I'm like, oh, that seems
*  right. And I'm sure the physicists are like, no, it's it's not right. I've settled long ago now on
*  becoming at ease with with like the level of this podcast, right, because I can't like
*  explicate all these like low level things. So I have to assume a certain level of education.
*  But because I have like smart friends, and they're like, I have no idea what you're talking about,
*  you know, in this podcast. So I have to, I have to be comfortable now with like, well, okay, this is
*  for a very particular audience or, you know, educated people who are like really engaged and
*  really want to learn these things, essentially. Exactly. I think that's the that's the things that
*  people will find the, you know, the podcast or they'll find these books because they're interested
*  in these topics. But your book, like does bring it down. And I think it opens it up for a lot
*  more people who are genuinely interested in these things. So congratulations, I suppose.
*  Thanks. Thanks. I appreciate that a lot. Yeah, I mean, there's a
*  there's a fine line between, you know, oversimplifying and abstracting important
*  principles. And that it's the latter that I'm striving to do. And so,
*  yeah, if it comes across that way, then that's that's great. Well, so like I said,
*  what the book does essentially is builds a careful and thorough case, going back,
*  the evolutionary tree and essentially beginning at life and making the case that you need life
*  for a gentile characteristics. And then, you know, you go from single organisms on up through, well,
*  lots of different things to build eventually the case for free will. And you know, how our behavior,
*  well, there's just too much to to talk about, or to list, I suppose. And we'll go through many of
*  these things. But just maybe as a jumping off point, do you have is there something I mean,
*  obviously, the topic free will the concept of free will itself might just be the answer to this. But
*  I'm, you know, you touch on so many different topics along the way. Is there one in particular
*  or one or two in particular that you find yourself revisiting and that bothers you? And, you know,
*  do I have this right? And how do I explain this? How do I even think about this, etc?
*  Yeah. So the theme of the book really is, I mean, the approach is to it starts out thinking about
*  the problem of free will, which we kind of articulated a little bit already these sort
*  of challenges to it. But then it backs off that and says, Look, if we want to understand that,
*  this this elaboration of this of this capacity in humans, which are the most complicated, you know,
*  example of it that we know of, it's going to get all muddied up and tied up with these other issues
*  of things like moral responsibility and consciousness and so on and things we can talk
*  about maybe later on. But what I wanted to do was think about just agents, really, you know,
*  if we want to say, well, how does a human being control their behavior? Well, how does anything
*  control its behavior? What does that even mean? How does a living thing do something? Right? I
*  mean, rocks don't do anything, planets, electrons, they don't act, things happen to them or near them
*  or in them, but they're not doing it. And so the doing there seems to involve choice in a sense
*  that the possibility of things being one way or another, and then control the possibility that the
*  organism as a system can influence which way things go, right, that some things can be up to
*  the organism, and it can be the decider. And so the challenges are twofold. First of all, there's
*  some external thing just pushing the system around, right? So it's just part of the universe,
*  and the universe has causes, and it's just part of that big causal web. And you can't really isolate
*  an entity as being a causal entity in itself. It's all just, you know, at equilibrium. Now,
*  it isn't all just at equilibrium, because living things keep themselves far from equilibrium. So
*  I think that problem is sort of generally solved because they have some causal insulation from the
*  rest of the world. But there's a deeper problem, which is the idea that, okay, but maybe just
*  within the organism, it's being pushed around by what some of its parts are doing. Or it's being
*  pushed around by all of its parts, you just go down levels and say, look, it's just neurons firing,
*  or it's just molecules being pushed around, or it's just atoms or quantum fields, or wherever you
*  think it bottoms out. So those are the real challenges. And what I've done in the book is
*  sketch what I think is just really a framework for thinking about those things in a way where
*  you could see how it could be resolved, that an organism could have causal power in and of itself,
*  and could have control and could exercise choice. But even for me, even after having written this
*  book, this question of choice is the one that still just niggles at me and just still makes me
*  kind of worried because it's just really hard to get away from the idea that this all depends on
*  physical machinery. It's not an idea. It does depend on physical machinery. And yeah, once you
*  dig down deeper and deeper, it's hard to escape from the idea that it's just the physical machinery
*  working. And so what I want to come to is the idea where actually what's controlling the way that
*  physical machinery works is what these patterns mean to the organism. They basically embody its
*  reasons for doing things, and doing things for reasons is essentially agency. But the little
*  question then of choice still... Well, what do you mean by choice? Do you mean when you dig down
*  and think about the neural underpinnings of choice and how that all plays out or our modern science
*  of how that plays out? What level are we talking about even in terms of choice? Well, yes, so all
*  of that. So what you might say is that you've got this complicated physical system. So there's this
*  typical thought experiment in the philosophy of free will, which is if you rewound the tape,
*  to some point in time, could you have done otherwise going forward again? So if you have
*  another chance, would you always do the same thing, in which case it's just all determined and it
*  really doesn't... Are you even really in control of that? Or are there some options? Is the future
*  open? And if it is, are you the one choosing what the future looks like? Now, usually that
*  that argument is that thought experiment is to do with the idea that if we're in a deterministic
*  universe, physically speaking, where there's only one possible future, then what does it mean
*  for an organism to have control over its actions if it never had any options?
*  And that's where compatibilism goes. And there's various people like Dan Dennett, many others, who've
*  presented and defended an argument that even if the universe is deterministic,
*  if the organism is configured in a certain way that it does things for its own reasons, and in
*  situation A, it does X because it wants to do X. And if the situation had been different, if it had
*  been B, it might have done Y. But when you rewind the tape, the situation won't be different. It'll
*  still be A, and you'll still do X, but that's still because you want it to. Now, I have problems
*  with that view, and we can talk about those. But I have a deeper problem with the framing of that
*  experiment, or in fact, the framing of the whole philosophical debate around free will, because it
*  generally assumes determinism is true, which our best physics, as far as I can gather from talking
*  to lots of physicists, suggests, well, it isn't true. We've got indeterminism in the world,
*  indeterminacy at low levels, but also at classical levels. If that's the case, then the problem is
*  flipped around. If you think the universe is deterministic, and you're talking about free will,
*  then the problem is really, wait, where does the freedom come from? If the universe is
*  indeterministic, then the freedom comes for free. You've got the system could go this way, that way,
*  this way, that way, whatever. It's all these jiggly random bits. What's more important there
*  is the control, the will of the organism. What it's doing is constraining all the jiggles
*  to make the system do what it wants, to make happen what it wants to happen.
*  That's a very different way of thinking about it, actually. It flips the script a little bit of a
*  lot of the debates because the debates in philosophy tend to end up with, okay,
*  either determinism is true, but free will is compatible with that, or determinism is true,
*  and free will is incompatible with that, and we don't have free will. I don't think either of those
*  positions is actually satisfactory.
*  How much... In the book, you expound on this argument and maybe this was an aha moment for
*  you where you said, well, the universe is indeterminate and how can I build up the case
*  from there? You can react to that. How much of your argument does hinge on indeterminacy?
*  Because you could still... It's so hard to think... From what you're saying, here's what I take from
*  what you're saying is because things happen randomly sometimes, we can take advantage of
*  that randomness, but that indeterminacy, at least on the quantum level or whatever level that you
*  want to go to, is outside the realm of our agency. Things just happen. What you're saying is we can
*  capture that and take advantage of it as a whole agent, but then... In some ways, yes. There's a
*  common rejoinder to the idea that you need some indeterminacy in the universe in order to have
*  possibility and choice and the idea that agency could exist at all. That rejoinder is to say,
*  well, look, either things are determined at a physical level, in which case I didn't make a
*  decision, or things are indeterminate at a physical level and they're just doing random stuff,
*  and if that's controlling my behavior, I still didn't make a decision. Where am I in the loop?
*  So the main point is not that the indeterminate things determine our behavior. That's just
*  another kind of reductionism is to say, actually, all the causes are physical at the lowest level.
*  That's where all the causation is happening. Now, some of it may be random bits, but when that
*  random jiggle of an electron or an atom or particle makes it bounce into something else,
*  that's the causation. It's all physical forces and so on. Now, the other way of thinking about that,
*  which is what I talk about here, and this goes back to Greek philosophers like Epicurus, for example,
*  who already saw that if all the causal work is being done at the lowest level, then you won't
*  have anything for the macroscopic organization to do. It's sort of causally comprehensive down here.
*  It doesn't matter how the organization flows from that. There's no top-down causation.
*  If, however, there's some indeterminacy down here or some underdetermination of what's going to happen
*  by the low-level details, that gives some scope for the organization to constrain things.
*  So it's not that the top-down causation reaches down and determines which way the random things go.
*  It determines which way the whole system goes. So it's a top-down imposition of constraint
*  that allows macroscopic-level things to matter and to have some causal power in the system.
*  That's where agency can emerge. That's where life can emerge. It's where, I think, ultimately,
*  our freedom to control our own behavior lies.
*  Mad Fientist So reading your book and hearing you talk just now brought me back to the same
*  point. Good old reductionist me to the Big Bang, right? I was going to open with asking you why is
*  there something rather than nothing. Maybe we can save that. So there's the indeterminacy,
*  and then there's the constraints and the organization of the system. Then I think,
*  well, how did it all begin? Was it all uniform? It couldn't have been uniform. So I guess in the
*  beginning, there had to have been some structure or the indeterminacy led to that structure.
*  There was a polarity and stuff, and things had to move to one pole, and that changed the other
*  pole. So I don't know. How did it all begin? John McAllister Yeah, so I think that's exactly
*  right. George Ellis, who's a physicist and philosopher, has written about this and many
*  others. So the idea, as far as I can understand it, is that this sort of pre-Big Bang, there was
*  this cosmic inflation, but it was very homogeneous. And quantum fluctuations at that level led to some
*  inhomogeneities. And without them, you would never have gotten any sort of gravitational pull that
*  was in any way directional, because everything was uniform. But once you get these inhomogeneities,
*  then they can act in a way that starts accreting things like galaxies and planets and so on.
*  And so you need some symmetry breaking in this early, whatever they call it, the surface of the
*  cosmic inflation or something like that. And I think that's right. And that principle, I think,
*  extends all the way up. If things are just homogeneous, there's never any sort of little
*  random thing or something to make things not like that. You don't get any forces.
*  We think about causes in physics, that there's a force acting on something here and so on. But
*  those forces only arise because you've got an uneven distribution of matter and energy.
*  It's the organization of the system that controls those forces. And if we focus, we just take the
*  initial conditions as given, and we focus on what's happening within it, then it looks like,
*  oh, well, all the causation is exhausted by knowing where the things are and what the forces are
*  between them. But that's only an instantaneous kind of view of the system. You have to ask,
*  well, wait a minute, why are they in those positions? How they get that way? And lots of
*  systems, it doesn't matter. But in living systems, it does matter, because living systems are
*  historical. That's what life is. It's a historical process. So if you don't think about causation
*  extended through time, you're sort of missing the big point of what life is. It continues. It
*  persists. That's its whole shtick. And it does that by accreting causal power through these
*  historical interactions. It's all a process, man. All a process, man. So where I get stuck is,
*  whether indeterminacy is necessary, or if you started with some sort of organization and some
*  sort of principle, some sort of asymmetry, would you actually need indeterminacy to make the case
*  that free will exists? Or could you build the case simply from that top-down self-organizational
*  principle that leads to life? And then you can have top-down through time, whether we actually do need
*  indeterminacy in that case. Right. Well, so Dan Dennett probably makes the strongest,
*  most compelling case for that view, which is that we don't need indeterminacy, that there isn't any.
*  But there could be still indeterminacy. It's just whether we need it to seal the deal for free will,
*  for example. Yes, exactly. Yeah. I mean, yeah, he thinks it's not relevant. Okay. So he thinks the
*  question is not relevant there. And that's a defensible position, but it's one that I disagree
*  with. So partly he is interested in free will from the standpoint of its relevance for moral
*  responsibility. So in a sense, those two things are tied up together in his reasoning. What he
*  wants to do is find what he calls a kind of free will worth wanting. That is the free will that
*  would allow us to say some things are praiseworthy or blameworthy or deserving of reward or punishment
*  and so on. So it protects our sense of moral responsibility on which basically all human
*  society is founded. So he would say there's all sorts of thought experiments that he comes up with
*  where you've got some agent, James, and he wants to kill his uncle, but then he's going to, he's
*  going on his way to do it, but he decides not to, but unbeknownst to him, an evil neurosurgeon has
*  implanted a thing in his brain and it makes him do it. And so he did never really had a choice,
*  but is he still responsible? And it's a sort of an idea of dissociating the idea of choice from
*  responsibility. Now I think those thought experiments take a lot for granted in, for example,
*  the existence of James and his uncle and any agents and life, right? Why would there be life
*  in a universe that's completely deterministic? Because the whole point of life is it's doing
*  things to keep itself organized in a way that sort of depends on there being some options of doing
*  other things could have occurred. And if that's never the case, then it's not obvious to me how
*  you would get life at all. It's not obvious to me, certainly how you get complicated agents that
*  seem to have, devote so much machinery and energy to the processes of decision-making
*  and action selection, if in fact there are no decisions to make and there are no actions to
*  select. So for me, a lot of the thought experiments in compatibilism take way too much for granted.
*  And I would say if you're going to assume that the universe is deterministic and then work from
*  there, that your first job is to say, why would we have agents at all? And explain that. And then
*  you can have a conversation about moral responsibility in my view.
*  Mad Fientist Well, you do talk about indeterminacy in terms of stochasticity in the brain,
*  which is just rampant. So if we boil it down to like we're deciding on what to
*  watch on TV or something, no one watches TV anymore, but terrible example. But what car to buy? No one
*  drives anymore. Anyway, so in that case, do we need the indeterminacy to influence our choice?
*  Or at that level, is it at that level is indeterminacy unnecessary, but it's
*  necessary as a precursor, so to speak.
*  Dr. Kahn Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So two things, I think both can be true. The main point is that
*  indeterminacy in the system allows macroscopic organization to emerge and for meaningful
*  patterns to inhere at macroscopic levels and have some causal power in the system. So it gives some
*  causal slack in the system to use George Ellis's term and means that we can get complexity and
*  hierarchy where the patterns at a high level are important, whereas the particular instantiations
*  in neural firing, for example, they're a bit arbitrary and contingent and they don't matter
*  that much. It'll be some instantiation, but those high level patterns are multiply realizable.
*  And what drives the system is what the pattern means, not the particular details of its
*  instantiation in any given moment. Again, they'll vary from moment to moment. So that's the broad
*  idea is that actually in most of our behavior, first of all, most of our behavior is not of the
*  kind that philosophers tend to be concerned with these experiments or that neuroscientists tend to
*  study in their controlled experiments in the lab, where it's like a binary decision right now.
*  It's an instantaneous thing and you've got two choices and let's figure out what drives your
*  choice at one moment. But I mean, actually, most of our behavior is managed, right? It's managing
*  our behavior through time. So we have plans to carry out those plans. We have goals to achieve
*  those goals. We have to constrain our behavior on a moment by moment basis in a top down kind of
*  of a way. So right, my plan for this hour or two is to talk to you. And that's constraining my
*  behavior, right? I'm not getting up and going out of the room. So that just happens all the time,
*  right? Whenever we, and it has to, otherwise we would have no plans. We'd never be able to do
*  anything that's future looking. So in real terms, organisms manage their behavior through time and
*  a lot of that is actually becomes habitual, right? We don't have to think about it in the moment.
*  We're not actually making a choice. We have made a choice before and that guides our behavior right
*  now in a way that we don't have to think about. So there's all this kind of long-term causation
*  through time nested kind of constraint that is informing our action on at any given moment.
*  Now, sometimes there are some decisions that we make that we don't know what to do, right? It's
*  not habitual. It's a new situation or it's a situation where we don't have enough information
*  to discriminate amongst the range of alternatives as to which one is optimal or we just don't care
*  that much. So it's like, I don't really care. I'll have a tuna sandwich, a chicken sandwich. I don't
*  care. I'll pick one or I'll let my brain pick one. It's a weirdly sort of doulless way to frame it,
*  but the idea is that actually that randomness that's in the system can be a resource that
*  organisms can use in some circumstances. But it's important to say, I'm not saying that all of our
*  decisions are driven by that randomness. It's that the organism can decide to use that randomness
*  sometimes. And that becomes a really interesting kind of sort of case. And there's lots of examples
*  where organisms do that from very simple things like escaping from a predator, where actually
*  being predictable is terrible. Predictable things are lunch for predators.
*  But in that case, you have to have a very predictable response to escape. You have to
*  choose to escape in that case. Exactly. So what you've got in some cases is you've got
*  a drive to do something, but it doesn't matter what you do so much. It's really important to do
*  something, move left or right. It's more important that that happens than the decision of moving left
*  or right. And in fact, it's sometimes good if you always move left, predators would take advantage
*  of that. Same as if you're, I don't know if you play poker at all, but if you're predictable at
*  the poker table, people will pick up on those patterns. That's why some of the poker pros
*  actually use randomizers literally to say whether they'll bet or raise or whatever.
*  Because they don't trust their own ability to randomize. Yeah.
*  That's exactly right. Yeah. I mean, the example that comes to mind is if someone's trying to
*  shoot you, you're supposed to, I forget what the pattern is called, but you're supposed to zigzag
*  randomly as you run away instead of running straight away. Yeah. Exactly. And so you have
*  to have like a randomizer in your head. When should I zig? When should I zag? Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah. And so different organisms use those. And there's actually a resource in a sense,
*  in mammalian brains, for example, there's a system that seems to control the randomness of
*  ideas of what to do. So when we're in some situations, some ideas may occur to us of what
*  to do. And some of those will be habits of thought. So when we get up in the morning,
*  it occurs to us to take a shower, or it may not even consciously occur to us, we just do it.
*  Right. It doesn't occur to us to maybe do a disco dance or play twister or something like that.
*  Whatever. However, there are circumstances where when we're doing something, we're engaged in some
*  activity, maybe it's not turning out so well. So we've got systems to monitor. We've set some goals.
*  Are we achieving those goals? Or are they being frustrated? When we're not achieving them,
*  a good thing to do is go back to the drawing board and say, I need to try something else.
*  And sometimes the best way to do that is to expand this kind of search space of options that you then
*  evaluate. And so there are systems with the locus coeruleus in the brain stem that sends
*  norepinephrine to parts of the cortex that effectively kind of raises the temperature
*  of the system and shakes it out of the ruts that it's in, the obvious things to do, and helps it
*  think outside the box. There is some randomness in the system that organisms can use as a resource
*  to either break a deadlock where they don't really care what they do, what option they take,
*  but it's important to do something. So they can't keep thinking about what it is. They just have to
*  do something. And they just kind of let the system resolve that, resolve these competing options.
*  Which I think, by the way, is what happens in those Libit experiments of raising your
*  hand whenever the hell the urge takes you. I think that's what's happened. And in fact,
*  you can track that readiness potential as a noise accumulator.
*  Soterios Johnson 21.12.21
*  Why don't you just expound on that a little bit? Just some people won't know Libit. I remember,
*  even as a graduate student in neuroscience, one of the post-docs came up to me and asked me what I
*  thought of the Libit experiments. I was like, what are those? And he explained them to me. I was like,
*  oh, I don't know what I think about those. But then when you dig down into it, yeah.
*  Soterios Johnson 21.12.21
*  They're very famous experiments that are supposed to
*  tell us about free will or even are interpreted as showing that, in fact, we don't have free will,
*  that you're not making a decision. Your brain is making a decision and it only tells you after
*  the fact. So the setup is very simple in the task that the person has to do. So they're seated at a
*  table and they have a little thing on their wrist that measures the electrical conduction in their
*  muscles. And what they have to do is just flick their hands like that, whenever the urge takes
*  them. So that's the explicit instruction. Whenever you want to, just flick your hand like that.
*  And they're wearing an EEG, which is recording their brain waves. And especially over the
*  supplementary motor area, which is involved in motor planning, you can see prior to when someone
*  does an action, that there's some electrical potential that you can see that ramps up until
*  the point where they make an action. So that's fine. That makes sense. If you're going to do
*  something, some part of your brain plans it and then it does it. The bit that was surprising to
*  people was the other bit of the experiment is that he asked people to watch a clock that was
*  going around like this and keep track of the moment when they felt consciously the urge that
*  they were about to do something. And what was really surprising is that this readiness potential
*  in the brain started to ramp up way before they supposedly consciously felt this urge to do it.
*  Like about 200 milliseconds, 300 milliseconds before.
*  And thus we have no free will.
*  And thus we have no free will. That was the extrapolation from that. That was the
*  interpretation. Now there's a whole bunch of reasons why that interpretation doesn't hold,
*  in my view. First of all, you're just acting on a whim. Literally, if all you were doing was letting
*  some slight randomness within your brain resolve a competition between doing it and not doing it
*  at any given moment, fine. That's actually a really good way to do it. You've got no reason
*  to care. Nothing is at stake. What you did was decide to sit down in the chair and do the
*  experiment. That was your deliberative decision. And it's one of those decisions that constrains
*  your behavior then through time. So there's that. There's the fact that actually, if you look at the
*  way the data were captured, in order to see that little signal with all the background noise that's
*  going on, you have to record it over many, many trials. And when you do that, you have some way
*  to compare them to each other. So they time lock to the point at which an action is taken.
*  So an action is taken, and then they look backwards in time. And what they see is this
*  readiness potential ramping up. And they say, well, look, it starts to ramp up here. That's when the
*  decision was taken, because it inevitably goes up like this, and then you act. Now, it only inevitably
*  goes up to an action if you start with an action. If you start with always there was an action,
*  then it looks like this inevitable ramping up. If you start with some time lock to some random
*  thing like a sound cue, then what you see is actually activity goes up and down and up and
*  down. It's just kind of noisy. And there's a sort of an accumulator, a noise accumulator in there,
*  a short-term plasticity that allows the noise to ramp up. But sometimes it goes down again,
*  and they don't do an action. So it very much looks like this is an instance where, yeah,
*  there's noises of resource. It breaks this deadlock, allows you to act on a whim when you've
*  already decided to. And in fact, there's really nice experiments from Liat Moudrik and Uri Maus,
*  where they did this very same kind of physical setup. But the choice that the person had to do
*  wasn't arbitrary. It was a choice between right and left hand that was picking one charity versus
*  another that was going to get some real actual money in the real world. And they cared, it was
*  set up that they cared about some of the charities more than others. And when they do that, then the
*  readiness potential, you don't see it. It's not linked to the action. So when you're making a
*  deliberative decision, it's just a whole other sort of scenario. Yeah. So there are these cases
*  where you can make a random decision and you can use the randomness explicitly in real time
*  to do that. More generally, the randomness across time allows that microscopic organization to
*  emerge. Yeah. And then the other sort of, so just to get back to the locus seruleus thing.
*  So one of the cases in which using a bit of randomness is good is if your current options
*  for what to do aren't turning out very well. So you can, I mean, there are systems that say,
*  am I achieving my goals? If you're not, there can be a signal that's sent back. It's nor epinephrine
*  sent back from the locus seruleus to parts of the cortex that the effect of that is to raise the
*  temperature of the system, to shake it out of its ruts, the local minima that it's in, and allow it
*  to explore more of option space and suggest some things that are really outside the box.
*  So you can think about the origins of creative thinking that way. And what's really creative is
*  that I'm not just doing the same thing. I'm not just doing the same thing everybody else does.
*  I'm going to think of something really novel. And most of those really novel ideas aren't very good.
*  So what you want is to subject those ideas of what to do to your evaluative system that
*  predicts, okay, well, okay, yeah, this idea occurred to me, but what's going to happen
*  if I carry that out? Is that going to be a good outcome or not? And so that's where the willing
*  part comes back into the equation, even if you're using some randomness to generate ideas.
*  You said outside the box. And when you said that, I happened to be thinking about a state space
*  and trajectories through that state space. And when you said, kick you out of a local minima,
*  I'm still in the same state space of possibilities that is constrained by all of the
*  constraints. So I was going to ask you about creativity later, and I might as well now.
*  I mean, how do we create actually anything new? Because presumably through your story,
*  free will comes about, right? It is allowed through agency over evolution. And at some point,
*  you have, quote unquote, free will. It's not out there in the ether, and then we just harness it.
*  And so that, in essence, then is actually a new creation. But then when you raise the temperature
*  via epinephrine or whatever mechanisms that we talk about, we're still kind of constrained by a
*  state space. But we all want to get as close to the edge of that state space as possible to be as
*  creative as possible. So how do you think about creativity? When we're being creative, are we
*  really just using our, whether we're using our will or not? Maybe the better question is,
*  how do we use our will to best pop out of many local minima to be as creative as possible?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. All great questions. So I think there's a balance between most of life
*  is this learning experience. So you've learned from past experience, what are good things to do
*  and what are not. That's why you have all these habits and policies and heuristics and so on that
*  guide behavior in really, really useful ways that we don't have to think about too much, because
*  we've already thought about it. We've already had, we've done the reinforcement learning,
*  that all been done. And of course, evolution does the same thing over millions of years,
*  we do it over our individual lifetimes. So all of that happens because it's good, right? It's
*  usually adaptive to guide behavior based on what has happened in the past. And that's true up to
*  the point when it's no longer adapted to do that. And actually, a really good example of that is,
*  is, you know, what Thomas Kuhn called the paradigm shifts in science. And Karl Popper has written
*  about this as well, the idea that, you know, everybody's going along sort of with these
*  shared assumptions that they're not even thinking about in a field. And that's that shapes and
*  constrains the paradigm of both experiment and theory and interpretation. And that can seem
*  productive until you kind of hit a wall when people finally realize wait, something's not working.
*  And some people may keep hammering away at the same paradigm, but some people may say, well,
*  wait a minute, maybe there are some assumptions here that we need to examine, we need to make
*  them explicit again. And we need to see we need to back off and go into some other sort of parallel
*  space. So I think a lot of creative thinking in individuals is like that, where you've got your
*  your current thinking is not working out for some reason, it encourages you to, to expand this
*  search space, but not like into anything, right? You can't have an infinite search space, because
*  we have finite time. But also, even if you might want to ignore one little bit of what your history
*  has told you, you don't necessarily want to ignore everything that all your history is told. Right.
*  So you don't want to back off completely to a blank slate that doesn't know anything.
*  You just want to do that in a in a with respect to some particular problem space. And so I think
*  that's, you know, you can see constraints as a totally negative thing. It's like stopping me
*  from thinking these other ways. But generally, you can see it also was a really positive thing
*  in that it's, it's focusing your search in ways that have been adaptive and productive in the past.
*  And you have some control over that, you know, to say, well, actually, it's no longer productive.
*  Now I need to pull back a little bit, think of something else.
*  Yeah, I like in the book, how you you return multiple times to this idea that if we didn't
*  have constraints, if we didn't have possibility spaces, free will is kind of useless, because
*  what are you deciding upon? There's going to be no utility for you. If you're truly free, you're,
*  there's nothing to be free of, essentially. Yeah, it's a weird sort of view. So there's a very
*  absolutist conception of free will that's used the common in the in the philosophical literature,
*  and then some of the neuroscientists talking about it as well, which is to say, you're only free,
*  you're only really free if your behavior has no prior causes affecting it whatsoever.
*  If you can trace anything you're doing to some prior cause, then you're not free.
*  Now, if you follow that logical conclusion, it becomes really incoherent.
*  So one of the ideas, one of the frames of this is to say, okay, look, yeah, I can do what I want,
*  I can act for reasons. But where did those reasons come from? I didn't want to want something. This
*  goes back to Schopenhauer. Sam Harris has expressed that a lot. Robert Sapolsky does as well.
*  Say, if I can't choose what I want, then I'm just being constrained by these prior causes.
*  And that might be my genes, it might be all my prior experiences, it might be the way my
*  brain develops, and so on. That's a constraint to the limit.
*  Exactly. And so that is seeing those things as determinants of your behavior, as opposed to
*  influences on your behavior, that's still the use and scope for things to be up to you,
*  as a whole organism. As a whole, yeah.
*  When you think about that view, it's kind of literally head scratchy. It's like, well,
*  what do you want? What kind of freedom would that be if you could do whatever, if you could want
*  whatever you want? Well, fine. Why would you want anything? And if the answer is, well, I'm going to
*  want to want what I want, you're in this inmate regress, where ultimately, the self disappears
*  in that view. Any sort of system that you would think has ultimate freedom and is not constrained
*  in any way by prior causes is just a random behavior gen. That's not a self. The self only
*  persists through time. It only exists as a thing that has continuity through time.
*  Anything else is just an instantaneous physical system. The property of selfhood is one that is
*  diachronic, right? It extends through time. It's not synchronic or instantaneous. And so it becomes
*  a really incoherent notion. The self is made of constraints. Your self is just you continuing
*  to constrain all the stuff that you're made of into being you. You're just stopping it from taking
*  on a form that isn't you. That's what selfhood is. And you can think about that in psychological
*  terms, but you can also think of that in very simple terms. That's what life is to. The simplest
*  single cell organism is continually working to constrain its organization in that pattern.
*  Right. And it's a dynamical pattern. It's not a static thing, but it's still that pattern is
*  what makes a bacterium a bacterium, for example. And it's doing work to keep that going. And if
*  it weren't doing that, it wouldn't be alive. It's not a life. There's many life in an instant. Again,
*  life is a historical extension through time. I just realized I must have that kind of
*  completely unbound free will because many I've had multiple listeners tell me I seem to have
*  a random generator with my questions. So maybe I do have that kind of free will.
*  It's funny. I had a friend who had, he didn't have random thoughts, but when you're having a
*  conversation with him, he would say things that to me would be just out of the blue.
*  And to him, there was a train of thought, but it went so fast that he skipped over like four or five
*  connections and then just came out with something. And I'd be just bewildered. And we'd occasionally
*  ask, where the hell did that come from? And sometimes he was able to track it back.
*  Yeah, it's hard to track back. I do that with analogies a lot where it makes complete sense
*  to me, but I can't remember how I got there. And then I realized on paper it looks terrible.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, sometimes they work. Sometimes those things work and sometimes they don't,
*  but that's where I have some ability to inspect them and evaluate them is useful.
*  You make this distinction between our whole selves. So what I want to ask you is about
*  what we think of as ourselves, which is our subjective awareness.
*  How does that relate to what you describe as our whole selves? And then, and free will,
*  how does then free will come into the picture? Yeah, no, I mean, those are really, really tough
*  questions. And generally, we think about people's kind of common conception of free will.
*  I think what they take it to mean is that there's some me, some self that is able to deliberate and
*  decide at any given moment what to do, where I'm in charge and I can make decisions and I have some
*  responsibility for them. And when you dig into what that conception of the self is, it's really
*  tricky. And I think there's a naive idea that there's this unitary self that can be isolated,
*  that's sitting inside your brain, watching things go on. And it's the sole sort of decider. And
*  there might be some particular part of your brain where you could find that bit. And I don't think
*  that's right. I think the self is more made up of all these sort of perceptions that you're having,
*  but also all of the memories that you have. So historically, all of the ideas and attitudes and
*  policies that you have, the commitments that you have and the plans that you've made, so very much
*  informed by the past and directed towards the future. And what we are right now, as physical
*  things, is just, I think, the momentary avatar of that self that extends through time. And we're
*  informed by our past self about what's a good thing to do on behalf of our future self, generally.
*  And how far in the future you think is interesting. How far you're capable of thinking
*  varies between people, it varies across species, it varies across age and under various conditions
*  and so on. So the self for me is not just that momentary thing, certainly not just the momentary
*  physical configuration in an instant. It's that through line, through time. That for me is the
*  self. And thinking about how that constrains and informs our behavior and how it guides our behavior
*  manages it through time, I think is the interesting thing. Focusing on these instantaneous binary
*  decisions, I think, just puts us into a wrong frame of thinking about that's just not how organisms
*  work. That's a very philosophy process, process philosophy oriented statement there. It is,
*  I think. So then how does free will come into the picture in terms of the feeling that we have of
*  ourselves versus ourselves as more than just our consciousness? And then is free will always under
*  the harness of our consciousness? Or I think what you're going to say is free will is under the
*  harness of ourselves as agent, as whole selves. So free will, I mean, free will usually is discussed
*  as a term in relation to humans. And I think that's fine. I take the same approach in the book. And
*  what I talk about otherwise is agency. So agency you can think about as this doing things for reasons
*  that in here at the level of the whole organism, right? They're the whole organism's reasons for
*  doing things where there's some holistic kind of processing going on, where the organism is not
*  being pushed around by individual bits of its parts, but it's doing a big integrative decision
*  making process that says, what's the scenario that I'm in now? What are all these things in the world
*  that I'm encountering right now? What's my internal state? What are my short term goals?
*  What's my long term plans? We have this nested kind of contextual top down constraint.
*  All of that I think is right. That happens. And that justifies saying it's the agent doing something.
*  It's not just a physical system being pushed around by its parts. And so I think we have all of that.
*  And then we have this consciousness. So the question is, what is consciousness
*  doing in this picture? And I think if you think about the nervous system as a control system,
*  the reason that we have a nervous system is because controlling our behavior in the world
*  is a really good way to do homeostasis. So any living system wants to keep itself organized.
*  And in order to do that, it has to keep various parameters within
*  livable limits. So you can't let your temperature go too high. You can't let your fuel get too low,
*  all these other sorts of things. You have to keep everything organized just so. And you have to do
*  some work to do that. And one way to do that is to reconfigure, say, your metabolism when something
*  in the world changes. Say the oxygen runs out and you switch from, if you're a yeast, from aerobic
*  to anaerobic respiration. But another way to do that is to move. Okay, there's no more oxygen here.
*  I should move to where there is oxygen. And then you can think, well, okay, well, you need a control
*  system to say, how do I move? And where do I move? How do I know where there's more oxygen?
*  And so on. So from that simplest kind of conception of behavior, you can think about
*  much, much more complicated behavior, like what we do, or other animals, as just kind of an
*  elaboration on that theme. We're trying to maintain ourselves. We have goals that now
*  extend much further into the future. We're not just reactive to every stimulus that comes along.
*  We're proactive and we make plans and so on. But the point of behavior is still generally
*  at base level to stay alive. So if that's true, then we can ask, well, what does consciousness
*  get us as a control system function? What does it give us that we didn't have before?
*  And first of all, if we back off the idea of conscious feeling, what it feels like,
*  we come to some cognitive capacities that we have that other organisms may not. And those are things
*  like metacognition and introspection. So we don't just act for reasons. We can reason about our
*  reasons. And we don't just think about objects and things in the world. We can think about our own
*  thoughts. So we have this kind of recursive extra level or levels that allows our cognition itself
*  to be something worth thinking about. And that becomes really valuable as a control parameter
*  or control faculty because, for example, it lets us think about the certainty that we have. So we're
*  not just having a belief. We can think about, well, how certain am I about that belief?
*  And where did that belief come from? Was I right to make that judgment? Maybe I made a wrong
*  inference. Maybe I had bad data or maybe it was just something random in the world that I
*  shouldn't pay attention to. So all of those things, that ability to introspect and to do
*  metacognition, you can see the value of them in a control system kind of language. Now,
*  the consciousness question is really tricky, though. Why should it be valuable for those things to
*  feel like something? Maybe thinking about your own thoughts just necessarily produces a conscious
*  mind. Maybe that architecture just makes that happen. I don't know.
*  But under that, it could be epiphenomenal, right?
*  If it could be phenomenal and still causally effective, right? It could be emerging in that
*  sense. But when it emerges, it could be causally effective. Sure. Okay. And so one way that it is
*  causally effective, I think, unarguably, is that we can tell each other what our thoughts are.
*  Right? And because we're a hyper social species, you can see the value of that even in something
*  simple like coordinating action. Right? So say we're going out, we're hunting a mammoth,
*  and I say, go left, and you say, go right. And then, you know, so-
*  We're always hunting mammoths these days.
*  As you do on a Saturday morning, off we are hunting mammoths. And we need to coordinate who's
*  doing what. And you need to know what I'm thinking of. And I need to know what you're thinking of.
*  And of course, as we get the emergence of language and culture, however that happened,
*  then consciousness pays off, I think, in that arena, because you have to be conscious of
*  your thoughts in order to say them to somebody else. At least, I think you do. So, yeah.
*  At least some of the time.
*  Some of the time, at least. Right? So, yeah, there's a- But coming back to the sort of
*  phenomenal aspects of conscious experience, why it feels like something, what that gets you,
*  it's really hard to know. I mean, there are some arguments for why different qualities of experience
*  are important. Mark Soames, for example, has really interesting work on this, where he's saying that
*  actually the affective quality of different emotions that you have, the way they feel,
*  becomes important in order that you can distinguish different types of things that
*  you have to care about all at the same time. Now, at some-
*  Constraints, as a set of constraints, perhaps.
*  Yeah. Well, you might be hungry or thirsty or horny or afraid that there may be threats,
*  different things. All of those things carry some sort of homeostatic signals. So, if you're afraid,
*  that's a signal that says this situation is bad, do something to reduce that feeling of fear,
*  and we'll be back in happy times. If you're thirsty, it's again, this situation is bad,
*  do something to bring that parameter back into healthy range. However, if all of those things
*  were feeding into the same decision space, because they have to be adjudicated over at the same time,
*  because you can only do one thing at a time, and they didn't have some qualitatively distinct label
*  to them, you wouldn't know what you were feeling was about, but you wouldn't know what the signals
*  were about. That's his argument. I think that makes some sense. I don't know why they have to
*  feel the way they do. Right. Yeah, that's always the question.
*  That's the tricky question. So, in terms of free will in humans, I think what we get in the
*  evolution of humans, in the expansion of our prefrontal cortex, these neural facilities or
*  faculties for executive function, metacognition, introspection, and so on, and ultimately
*  consciousness, they give us an extra level of agency. They give us a kind of meta agency
*  where we can think about what we're doing and why we're doing it and whether those were good
*  reasons to do it. We can reason about our reasons and tell each other about them.
*  In some sense, the story of free will, you could say tracks the story of consciousness or the
*  story that you could make in terms of how agency gave us consciousness, right? In some sense.
*  So, you've referred multiple times to free will in humans. One of my questions is, well,
*  what's the minimal criteria? Where is the line in agency? Does that yeast cell you referred to?
*  It has agency. Does it have some semblance of free will? Does it have free will? Is there a
*  gradient that we should be thinking about of free will? How much there is for different
*  species, et cetera? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think you can think about different levels of
*  agency and you can start to operationalize that in various ways. So, one would be how many things
*  can you think about at once? What's the complexity of your action repertoire? So, a C elegans can
*  move forwards or backwards and it doesn't do much else besides that. If that's the repertoire that
*  it has to choose over, it doesn't require much cognitive depth to do that, right? It responds to
*  some local signals, touch and mechanical sensation, but there are things that are right here and now.
*  So, if it's thinking about anything, it's thinking about stuff right here and now and it's deciding
*  forwards or backwards and a few other things, right? So, that's pretty simple just in quantitative
*  terms, right? And I think you can say, well, as you get more complex animals and I follow the track
*  that goes along the lineage that leads to us, but of course, you could follow the track that goes to
*  insects or octopuses or birds or anything else and you might see different kinds of agency emerging.
*  How important are interneurons? I mean, you talk in the book about the development of between sensory
*  apparati and motor apparati and how in earlier organisms, they're yoked together. And then you
*  get this evolution where you have clusters of interneurons that then you can start having
*  recurrence. How many interneurons do we need? Well, I think the question is how many levels do you?
*  So, you can start in simple organisms where sensation and action are pretty tightly coupled
*  together. But I mean, not completely, right? So, not linearly. So, even in a bacterium that is
*  a chemotactic gradient, if you control everything else in your experiment, say,
*  and you just look at one biochemical pathway in isolation, it looks like a very linear kind of
*  thing, right? There's a receptor, some proteins get phosphorylated, they affect the flagellum,
*  which rotates this way or that way and that determines which way the bacterium goes.
*  But even in that system, it's actually much more integrative than that. There's all kinds of signals
*  coming in in the real world from other things in the environment, from cell crowding, from temperature,
*  from osmolarity, and really importantly, the recent history of the organism itself, right? That's how
*  it knows if it's going up a gradient or down a gradient. Okay, so you've got some agency,
*  it's a holistic kind of processing that happens like that, but still pretty tight coupling.
*  And the holistic integration is all in one level, right? Now, there's a limit to how many cogs you
*  can join up together in one level before they get jammed up. And so, what you get in organisms with
*  neurons is you've got sensory neurons and motor neurons, and sometimes there's a pretty clear
*  sort of reflex arc between them, but you can also get these intervening levels of interneurons,
*  and they're useful because they can integrate information from multiple different sensory
*  things. They may compare the level of a touch at one end versus the other end of the animal,
*  for example. You can't do that. Or in the past, absolutely. And so, the more levels that you get,
*  the more abstract the things that you can think about. And this is really obvious in visual
*  perception. So, vision and hearing aren't just local senses. We're not immediately touching the
*  things that we care about in the world, the objects or the odorants. What we're getting
*  is just disturbances of the electromagnetic spectrum or vibrations in the air. I don't care
*  about photons hitting my retina. What I care about is what they're bouncing off of in the world.
*  Now, to figure that out, my retina doesn't know that. Some work has to be done. Some processing
*  work has to be done. And the best way to do that, or at least the way that it happens in nature,
*  is through a hierarchy where neurons at the first level integrate across some photoreceptors,
*  neurons at the second level integrate across some of these, and they perform
*  contrast enhancement or divisive normalization, or they amplify signals, or they integrate,
*  or they act as a temporal filter, or whatever it is. But what we end up with is that these neurons
*  at this level, they're not just responding to dots of light, they're responding to edges.
*  They're responding to objects. They're responding to types of objects. Ultimately, we get to the
*  point where we can think about types of objects. We can think about the relations between them.
*  We can link our perception, our sensory data, to we can make inferences about what's out in the world
*  and tie that back to our accumulated knowledge about those things in the world. So when we see
*  a face, well, it probably belongs to a human being. Probably attached, maybe it can talk,
*  and maybe I should talk to it. So we know about things in the world and we bring that to bear
*  in guiding our behavior. So those levels become really, really important. And what's interesting
*  is that as you go up, you're coarse graining. In each transmission of information, actually,
*  a lot of the details are lost. Even from one neuron to another, this neuron here is getting
*  inputs from this guy. He may fire only if there's a certain rate of spikes coming in. But the pattern
*  of spikes doesn't matter. That's lost. And there's a digital readout here. Either the rate was high
*  enough to reach threshold or it wasn't. So loads of information is lost from level to level. And
*  that's true at population levels as well. So what you get is that these patterns at higher levels
*  mean something to the organism. That meaning has been, I want to say extracted, but actually created,
*  I think, is a better term for it. And it's those patterns, ultimately, the ones that are at the
*  highest level, that are the things that the organism cares about. Those are the actionable
*  patterns. I don't care, as I said, which photons are hitting my retina, which photoreceptor is
*  being activated. I care. What's going to guide my behavior is what are the objects that I infer
*  are out in the world? And what can I do about them? And what do I know about them? And so on.
*  So those intervening levels give you this cognitive depth, this ability to abstract.
*  And they also, I think, illustrate how it's the meaning of those patterns that's important.
*  It's not the low level details of neural firing. And for me, that's really key, because it gets us
*  away from this idea that the brain is an electrical machine. You often see these pictures of neuron A
*  fires, and then it makes neuron B fire, and that makes neuron C fire. And we start teaching
*  students about simple reflexes and so on. That kind of is what happens. But I think you can
*  flip that perspective for most of what's happening in the brain. It's not like that.
*  It's an informational machine. And what you have is rather than neuron B being driven by neuron A,
*  you've got neuron B surveying or monitoring its inputs. And it's got some criteria for what
*  kind of incoming patterns are going to make it send a signal. And that's a different way of
*  thinking about what's going on in the brain. It focuses the view on the meaning, the interpretation
*  of patterns through time, and the criteria that set those interpretations. And that's where the
*  historicity comes in, configures the system, such that the meaning of a pattern then becomes
*  actionable information for the organism. And it's decoupled from obligate action. It doesn't have
*  to drive it. It's just a part of the information that the organism then has in its cognitive arena
*  that amongst many other bits of information, that it's going to figure out what it should do
*  relative to. So can we draw a line on the phylogenetic tree and say free will began here
*  with this amount of complexity, this amount of hierarchy?
*  Yeah. I like to say that actually even the simplest life forms that we know about,
*  the simplest sort of free living life forms which are bacteria have a minimal kind of agency.
*  They do a minimal kind of cognition. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't call what they're
*  doing the kind of problem solving they're doing cognition. It seems to satisfy the abstract
*  definition of cognition for me. And then we can go from there. I don't like to draw these bright
*  lines. Although I will say that whatever happened in human evolution is probably a singularity of
*  some kind. People talk about the singularity. When is the singularity going to happen in AI?
*  It happened. We're the singularity. And how that happened is really interesting.
*  And it may be that it's not just some biological change from down our lineage in the difference
*  between a human brain and a chimp brain, for example, because we were proto humans that were
*  hominins and the whole species for hundreds and hundreds of thousands of years, millions of years
*  for some of those hominins that didn't take off in the way that our species did. We only did in very,
*  very recent time biologically speaking. And that probably is with some sort of cultural
*  spark that maybe literally lit the fire that let us do that. And that's a whole other sort of area
*  that's really interesting. So I see a continuum of all of these things. I don't like to draw those
*  distinctions of where there's a definition that applies here, it doesn't apply there.
*  But at the same time, I do see a difference in humans qualitatively. And it's interesting
*  to think about how that emerged. Okay, let's go back to gradients of free will. What I want to ask
*  is, we talk about different situations where when we need to run from a tiger, we're relying on
*  the fact that we have to move. And maybe then we create this random generator on our zigzag pattern
*  or jumping the tree, etc. And then when we have to deliberate more, we're engaging our free will
*  more. We're talking about free will as if it's a binary thing, either kind of on or off. But
*  what I want to get a sense of is how much free will that we have. And I know this is different
*  across even the course of the day because of will depletion, is it called?
*  Yeah, I'm not sure what I think about that. But yeah, just fatigue.
*  Fatigue, sure. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So okay. So when we're talking about free will here, what I like to do, because that has
*  so much metaphysical baggage, is just replace that with actually what we're really talking about,
*  which is conscious cognitive control of our actions. So let's just sort of try to naturalize it in
*  neuroscientific terms or cognitive science terms. And of course, Danny Kahneman has this system one,
*  system two idea, which is simplistic, but it's useful in thinking, okay, a lot of my behavior is
*  controlled by system one, which just means it's habitual. I don't have to think consciously about
*  it in order to go about most of the stuff that I do. But sometimes I do engage this other system
*  that's effortful, and it takes longer, it's inefficient. But it's what I need when I'm not
*  sure what I should do. When past experience is not a good enough guide, and I don't have one obvious
*  option. So if you think about Valavan who has more gradations of free will, you can think about
*  instances, first of all, in which you have a greater capacity to engage system two. So for example,
*  if you have more time on your hands, right, if you're not under an immediate threat, if you don't
*  have to spend your time just looking for food at every moment of the day, then you've got some more
*  just capacity in the world sense, to allow you to think about things, and you can deliberate a bit
*  more. Also, you may be able to plan over a longer time horizon. So we can do that, obviously,
*  in terms of things way beyond our own lifetime. A C. elegans probably isn't planning very far in
*  advance, right? It's reacting to things. It's like, what's my internal state? Okay, what should I do
*  about it? It's just very, very reactive. Whereas as you get more and more complex, you can be more
*  and more proactive, right? So you can guide and manage your behavior with more autonomy in a way
*  that is even, again, sort of mathematically formalizable. So David Crackauer and Jessica
*  Flack, for example, interesting work, where they're asking how much autonomy does an organism have,
*  and therefore in relations to say, how much mutual information is there between the current state of
*  the organism and its state at time t in the future, or t plus one or t plus two or so on.
*  The idea is that the more information the current configuration has about the future state,
*  the more autonomy it has, the less it's being pushed around by the exigencies of the environment.
*  The further into the future that is, the more agency it has, because it's not just
*  controlling how things go right now. It's not just making the immediate future happen one way
*  versus another. It's making the far future happen one way versus another. That requires sustained
*  effort through time, which humans are sort of obviously very good at. Other organisms are good
*  at it to lesser or greater extents. And even within humans, some humans are better at it than others.
*  Do you have a higher capacity for free will than I do? Is that what you're getting at?
*  I do. Much, much higher, dearly. Yeah. So I have a higher capacity for free will than I used to
*  when I was a baby. When I was a baby, I didn't have much capacity for agential control at all.
*  I was really reactive. I wasn't planning things. I didn't know much. I didn't have a good model of
*  the world. I only had homeostatic signals, pretty much, to go off of, and then weird stimuli from
*  the environment that I didn't know what they meant or what they were about. So I had to develop
*  through time that knowledge and the control that allowed me to plan over a longer timeframe,
*  which usually means inhibiting immediate impulses. So impulse control is something that varies
*  throughout the lifetime. It can vary throughout a day, as you said, depending on how tired you are,
*  your impulse control is sort of effortful. It can vary depending if you've had coffee or alcohol,
*  or you become disinhibited if you had alcohol, for example. But it also varies between people.
*  So there are personality traits or measures of executive function that vary as traits between
*  people. In personality literature, it's basically conscientiousness that is a personality trait.
*  It is one of these predispositions we talked about at the start when we mentioned
*  the book in eight, which was really about how those things come to be.
*  So one of the ways you can think about it in two ways. One is that some people have more free will
*  than others, just in an operational sense. On average.
*  Better impulse control. Yeah, on average, as a trait over time. They have better impulse control.
*  They can carry out, carry through plans over a longer timeframe. They may be able to
*  integrate more information all at once and so on. In one way, you can say, well, that just is
*  reducing everything to biological machinery again. But on the other hand, it makes me think, well,
*  free will is not some mystical thing that's out there. It's magic. It's an evolved biological
*  capacity. Free will is just the name that we give to those sets of capacities, all the sorts of
*  agency that we inherited from other organisms, plus these elements of metacognition and executive
*  function and impulse control and planning and rationality that are expressed most in humans.
*  And the fact that we can see that it bears is evidence of that. It's evidence that that's an
*  evolved biological capacity that has some real neural underpinnings. So we can naturalize it.
*  It doesn't have to be mysterious. We can investigate it.
*  Of course, you have when you're a teenager before your prefrontal cortex was pruned,
*  you had less free will as well than after your preterm.
*  Teenagers clearly are, they engage in riskier behavior. They're more impulsive.
*  They're more emotionally labile and volatile. And there's very good reasons why that is.
*  They're not just faulty adults. There's very good reasons why adolescents should be characterized
*  by those kinds of traits. Sarah Jane Blakemore, for example, has done really beautiful work
*  explicating that and saying, look, these are adaptive at that point in the life history of
*  actually mammals, because it's true not just in humans. Teenage mammals of all sorts share
*  some of those traits. Yeah. Teenage squirrels. I like that.
*  One of the things that I appreciated, just getting back to what you were just talking
*  about, how there's different levels, essentially, personality traits, et cetera. And you really
*  go through in the book and helped me formulate how to think about these things in terms of nested
*  constraints on each other within the setting of thinking about a mind and how to think about
*  different processes of the mind. So at the base level, we could start with action,
*  which is like behavior. And you talk about this and you harken back also to your book,
*  Innate, where you touch on personality traits as well. But you could think of action and then
*  in the mind that there are these personality traits that are at a slightly higher level.
*  And then there are habits that you form via the personality traits. And then on top of that,
*  there's character, which is a longer term, slower process related to habits and personality traits.
*  And each, can you think the way that I thought about these when you're writing about them is
*  that each is a slower constraint on kind of the lower level. And I'm not sure a pure hierarchy
*  is the way to think about it. I'm sure it's not because it never is. But can you think about
*  those sorts of mind aspects in terms of hierarchy of or hierarchy of constraints?
*  Yeah, absolutely. I think that thinking about different parts of the brain being concerned
*  with things at different timescales in the first instance is really useful. We can think about,
*  for example, you know, a kind of a gradient of your motor cortex. What it's concerned with is
*  really controlling particular motor actions that you're doing, but then controlling the behavior
*  that you're doing. So you just took a drink from your mug there. Totally up to my free will to do
*  that. Right. Well, it was, you decided to take a drink from your mug. You didn't decide to move
*  your arm like this and so on. You didn't have to tell your motor cortex how to do that. Your motor
*  cortex knew how to do that. And it didn't matter. The details at that level don't matter. You were
*  still going to take a drink. Now, over a longer timeframe, you decided to do this interview,
*  and you decided to bring that cup in with you and having, but you knew you were going to need a
*  drink. So you were planning that. That was constraining what you did. And it was informing
*  what you just did. So I think that that's true. And if you look at the sort of neural correlates,
*  the receptive fields, if you will, of what neurons in different parts of the brain are interested in,
*  what they carry information about, then as you go up in the prefrontal cortex,
*  it's the longer, longer term planning that they carry information about and goals and behaviors,
*  not the short term motor actions. So I think we have that hierarchy of action. And in terms of the
*  trajectory through a lifetime, I think what we're seeing is the way that those different levels of
*  the hierarchy are getting configured and what they're coming to care about. So at the lowest
*  sort of levels, we've got systems that are controlling things that we see in even simple
*  organisms like risk aversion and threat sensitivity and reward sensitivity and things like delay
*  discounting. How long are you willing to wait for a reward? How quickly do you discount what the
*  reward value is, depending on how far away it is in the future. And all of those things are kind of
*  parameters of, you could say, tuning of control circuits that will all inform the way that an
*  organism tends to behave. And those, I think, are good kind of things to think about for where
*  very basic personality traits come from. Those could be things like extraversion, which is a
*  level of, I mean, in animals or infants, it's called surgency. It's really arousal, a level of energy,
*  a level of reward sensitivity versus neuroticism, which might be kind of a level of punishment
*  sensitivity or threat sensitivity and so on. And those things vary and they inform
*  the behavior of individuals. But what I want to really emphasize is that they don't determine
*  it on a moment to moment basis. What we're doing right now is not determined by our score on
*  extraversion or agreeableness or neuroticism. So what they do though is they inform the way
*  an organism adapts to the world. So each of us, and this is true of other organisms too,
*  forms these sort of characteristic adaptations to the things that we've learned about in the world.
*  So we don't act just because we're extroverted. We act because we're in a certain situation and
*  we know the people there or we don't. And we kind of know the social norms and we have some desires
*  and maybe we're out on the pole, as they say in Ireland. And all these things are going to
*  influence, I want to say not determine, influence how we behave in that moment.
*  And also, whether we're shy or not is going to have some influence as well.
*  So that distinction between personality and these characteristic adaptations that emerge
*  is really important because that's a trajectory. Again, it's a historical process. You can't make
*  sense of the behaviour of an organism right now like it's a robot that just has some tunes.
*  It has a history that has affected its habits of behaviour and habits of thought.
*  And ultimately, those habits of thought become so kind of ingrained that they become habits of
*  character. They're meta habits. It's not just in this kind of circumstance, I know that I should
*  tend to behave this way, but generally speaking, I am the kind of person who behaves this way
*  across many different kinds of circumstances. So those character traits emerge. And this is a
*  rejoinder to people who would say, well, your brain is just configured a certain way and you
*  had no control over that. And therefore, A, you have no free will right now. And B, we can't really
*  assign responsibility to you because you had no control over the way your brain is configured,
*  which entails everything that I was just talking about. And I would say, well, first of all,
*  that's a circular argument. It's only true if you never had control in any moment. If you do have
*  control in any moment and guiding your behaviour through time, then the way that your character
*  emerges is something that you had a hand in. And this goes back to very ancient writings on moral
*  philosophy and so on. Cicero, for example, had really interesting things to say about this. He
*  wrote these letters to his son who was off basically studying at university in Greece.
*  And a lot of it was advice on how we should behave, what were good ways to behave in this work,
*  which is called On Duties. And he talks about this. He talks about the way that, first of all,
*  our behaviour is constrained by being human beings, which we generally don't seem too
*  worried about. But it's the biggest constraint on our board. Then it's constrained by our individual
*  natures. That's the thing that people get hung up on, which is a tiny fraction. There's a little,
*  little variation on this big theme of human nature. And then it gets constrained or informed by our
*  experiences. But then he also says, but then a lot of it is just up to us. There's an up to us-ness
*  about it. And it was because of that, that we have some responsibility for thinking about our behaviour
*  through time, for thinking about our own character and for cultivating virtues and trying to live in
*  a way that we think is a good way to live. However, that is informed by societal norms,
*  parental example or indoctrination, religion, whatever moral, societal kind of touchstones
*  you may have. That idea of character being an emergent thing that you have a hand in
*  is, I think, a powerful one.
*  I don't have free will in that I have to go wake up my children fairly soon for school.
*  I know that after this, you're going to go hunt a woolly mammoth or something.
*  Absolutely. Yeah, it's lunchtime here.
*  And everything we've talked about, I just have so many more questions. I know I just repeat this ad
*  nauseam when I talk to people, but it just opens up more and more questions, everything we're talking
*  about. However, I want to make sure that we get to the question of artificial agency, artificial
*  intelligence, and whether they can. I mean, you actually end the book with a short prologue
*  on artificial agency. I think I have the artificial agents, the epilogue, sorry, not the prologue.
*  What do artificial agents, what does artificial intelligence need to have free will? Or do we
*  want it to have free will, et cetera?
*  Yeah, it's a great question. I think you could ask in the first instance, what does artificial
*  intelligence need to have intelligence? In many cases, when we're talking about artificial
*  general intelligence, if that's what people are after, if they would like to do that, and we can
*  come back to reasons why they should or shouldn't. But if they want to do that, if you wanted to
*  create an artificial system that you would think is actually intelligent in a general way, then,
*  well, it's the generalization that's the key thing. And so what you might need is a system
*  that is able to not just respond to loads and loads of data and pick out patterns and tons and
*  data, but to abstract, it's able to abstract principles, categories, causal relations,
*  types of relations between things, such that it knows it can sort of make an analogy in a new
*  situation. Oh, this is like that thing that I know about. It has these dynamics or principles that I
*  think are, you know, I know about from this other instance. And therefore, that can guide my behavior
*  here. And so when we use the term intelligence in natural systems, the payoff is always some kind
*  of behavior, right? We see intelligence in some adaptive, appropriate behavior that an organism
*  comes to usually under novel circumstances. That's how it cashes out. So intelligent is as intelligent
*  does, I think is the motto there. So what's interesting, if you think about an artificial
*  agent is, okay, well, what would it take just to get to that level of intelligence, where ultimately,
*  if it's cashing out in that way, then the system has to be able to do things, right? And it has to
*  be able to do things in the world. So it may have to be an embodied agent. It could be a simulated
*  world, but it has to be able to act. It has to be able to intervene on the world in a way that allows
*  it to make causal inferences. Because if it's just getting data, and it's pulling out correlations,
*  maybe those data have causal relations in them, but it can't know what's a real causal relation
*  and what isn't. And if it's acting, then it may need some reason to act one way versus another,
*  right? It may need some kind of utility function, master function, like what we have to stay alive,
*  that anchors purpose and meaning and value. Things have to be meaningful. They're not just
*  about things. They have to be for something. At least that's how it works in natural systems.
*  So you may need an embodied system that can act on the world, that can learn as an individual,
*  that can draw these abstract relations about things, and that can then generalize to other
*  sorts of scenarios. If you get all of that, and it's doing it in a way that we think is adaptive
*  and appropriate, then I think you might have artificial general intelligence. But in order
*  to do that, you may have to have made an agent, but I think not a passive system that's just
*  being fed data and operating on it and giving some kind of an output. It may have to be something
*  embedded in the world in a way that grounds its drive to abstract things, where it has to have
*  a reason to do that. And that reason has to be relative to some goal because reasons are always
*  just relative to something. They're normative. And without that normativity in the system,
*  you may not get agency. So to build intelligence, you may have to build an intelligence.
*  Spence McLaughlin
*  Do you need... So you could set its homeostatic set point. We could externally set it. Does it
*  need to auto regenerate? Does it need to maintain itself? Is there something special about life?
*  Is a question I keep coming back to.
*  Spence McLaughlin Yeah, that's a really good
*  question. And I have an intuition about it that there is, but it's hard to articulate...
*  Spence McLaughlin That's all I have too. I just keep saying I can't articulate it.
*  Spence McLaughlin Yeah, yeah, yeah. That becomes tricky. So
*  as I said, we have this master utility function, which is staying alive. And what that means is
*  regenerating the sets of constraints that keep all the parts together. So collectively, all the
*  parts embody constraints that keep all the other parts in the same organization. That's what being
*  alive is. Spence McLaughlin
*  And it's through those constraints that you've made the argument and built up that we have things
*  like free will. Spence McLaughlin
*  Absolutely. I think that's where the normativity is anchored. It's where meaning and purpose and
*  value get some reference point. But it's also the kind of functional architecture that when you start
*  building levels, it can have some sort of referential aspects to things out in the world.
*  Spence McLaughlin It can have some internal representations
*  that have meaning. And it's the meaning of those things that can drive... I don't want to say drive,
*  that the system uses to inform its behavior. So that's one way to do it. And I think you could
*  probably build an artificial system that has that kind of architecture to it. Whether that's the
*  only way to do it, I don't know. Maybe you can have a master utility function that isn't
*  keeping my architecture persisting in this pattern. Maybe it could be some other function
*  that then it can scaffold new goals and sub-goals off of. I think that's a really good but very much
*  open question, whether this idea of this artificial intelligence as an entity would have to be
*  actually an artificial life form.
*  Mad Fientist If you stay on average, you're going to take another six years. But are you in your
*  conversations with folks these days? This happened with innate, which you had conversations and it
*  made you think of the ideas that came up, you developing free agents. Do you have that yet?
*  Or is that still brewing for the...
*  Richard Hildesheim I have the germ of an idea that
*  is interesting to me because it's coming from both genetics and neuroscience.
*  Mad Fientist Cool.
*  Richard Hildesheim And that idea is that organisms in some way,
*  in order to do all the stuff that we've been talking about, to have all this kind of control,
*  they basically come to embody a model of the world. And they do that and we talk about predicted
*  models and generative models and so on in neuroscience all the time. A model of ourselves,
*  a model of the world. We can run simulations, we can make predictions of what would be a good
*  outcome and so on. And in genetics, that idea is there as well, the idea that the genome in some
*  way has a model of the organism in a way that's difficult to understand how that emerges, how it
*  gets decoded or decompressed. And that model is also, in a sense, a model of the environment
*  because it's a history of all the adaptations that have been successful in the ancestors that led to
*  that being that necessarily reflect the fittedness of the organism to the environment. So they're
*  jointly about the organism and the environment in that sense. And so it feels to me like there's
*  some underlying principles there. There's a sort of a through line where evolution may make this
*  idea of a generative model of the organism that includes a model of the environment
*  that allows the development to build a brain that then can do the same thing, but on an
*  individual time scale as opposed to over millions of years. And so, yeah, it feels like there's an
*  underlying principle there that's pretty important, this idea of embodying a model of the world,
*  but that has these different instantiations that might be interesting to explore.
*  That's a cool idea. All right, we'll end on a cliffhanger. My kids are totally going to be
*  late for school and that's okay because I've been talking with you. No, it's my fault. So,
*  and thanks for hanging with me. And I really appreciate the book and keep writing them,
*  man. They're really enjoyable. So I appreciate it.
