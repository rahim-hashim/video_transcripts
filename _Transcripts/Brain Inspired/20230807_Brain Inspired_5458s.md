# BI 172 David Glanzman: Memory All The Way Down
**Brain Inspired:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKwi4Sfe6yE)
*  Cells were around for billions of years before the nervous system came along.
*  And the question is whether non-neural organisms have memory.
*  Then I thought, well, what is this mean?
*  You know, it sounds like the synapses aren't where the memory is.
*  The memory is back in the cell body somewhere, and the synapses are simply a reflection of
*  the memory back in the cell body.
*  We do not have a satisfactory neurobiological explanation for any form of memory in any
*  organism.
*  Good day, you awesome brain-inspired people.
*  I am Paul.
*  This is Brain Inspired, and you're even more awesome if you support this podcast on Patreon,
*  where you can access full-length episodes, join our Discord community, etc.
*  Check that out if you're feeling generous at BrainInspired.co.
*  Today David Glansman joins me on the podcast.
*  So David runs his lab at UCLA, where he's also a distinguished professor.
*  David used to believe what is currently the mainstream view, that our memories are stored
*  in our synapses, those connections between our neurons.
*  So the idea is, as we learn, the synaptic connections strengthen and weaken until they're
*  just right, and that serves to preserve the memory.
*  So that's been the dominant view in neuroscience for decades, and is the fundamental principle
*  that underlies basically all of deep learning in AI.
*  Because of his own and others' experiments, which David describes in this episode, he
*  has come to the conclusion that memory must be stored not at the synapse, but in the nucleus
*  of neurons, likely by some epigenetic mechanism mediated by RNA molecules.
*  If this sounds familiar, I had Randy Gallistil on the podcast on episode 126 to discuss similar
*  ideas.
*  And David discusses where he and Randy differ in their thoughts.
*  This episode starts out pretty technical, because David describes the series of experiments
*  that led him to change his mind and led him to his current view.
*  But after that, we broaden our discussion to a lot of the surrounding issues regarding
*  whether and if his story about memory is true.
*  And we discuss meta-issues, like how old discarded ideas in science often find their way back
*  eventually, what it's like studying non-mainstream topics like David is studying, including challenges
*  trying to get funding for it, and so on.
*  So I link to a bunch of what we talk about in the show notes at brandinspired.co.
*  slash podcast slash 172.
*  All right, I hope you enjoy our discussion.
*  Here's David.
*  One of the things that I find most interesting about you is that you are a rare specimen
*  in that you have changed your mind about something scientifically.
*  Do you agree with me that that is rare in the world of science?
*  And well, to the extent that I've changed my mind.
*  Yeah, I think that's pretty rare.
*  And I think it's also if usually when people change their minds the way I've done and they're
*  older, it's a sign of impending senility.
*  Oh, we'll figure that out.
*  Yeah.
*  That gives me pause when I think about that.
*  So you're not.
*  You know, that's not serious.
*  You're not being serious, are you?
*  OK, good.
*  Well, I mean, I'm getting older.
*  But let me say that I would I'm perfectly I would perfectly believe that my colleagues
*  would take that view.
*  OK, I would be surprised if some of them didn't take that view.
*  Well, do you have colleagues that from before you changed your mind that give you a hard
*  time with regard to?
*  I not not so much.
*  I mean, some people just say, you know, they just kind of rolled their eyes.
*  So some of my colleagues and the people who've known me for the longest time, they they don't
*  agree with me, but they take it seriously in the sense because they know me and they
*  know the work I've done.
*  And, you know, I've done pretty good work in the field of synaptic plasticity and learning
*  memory.
*  And so, you know, I think people have to respect that.
*  So at least they know that I'm coming.
*  It's not like I don't know anything about synaptic plasticity.
*  Let's put it that way.
*  I know quite a bit about synaptic plasticity and how that relates to learning memory in
*  a pretty rigorous way, because I work on a model organism in which you can make very
*  rigorous connections between neural activity, synaptic change and learning memory.
*  I mean, it is probably the organism that is that gives you the most rigorous ability,
*  the ability to make the most rigorous connection.
*  So, I mean, I know something about this.
*  And so I think people, people who know me very well, they may not agree with me, but
*  I say people who take it seriously.
*  So the organism that you're talking about is one of two organisms that you are studying
*  these days, which is the a plesio, the sea snail, and which was one of the an organism
*  in which some of the first plasticity synaptic plasticity studies were done by Eric Kendall,
*  of course, and and others.
*  But OK, so maybe let's back up and I will have said this.
*  Eric was my postdoctoral mentor.
*  I mean, I started working on a plesio.
*  What does he think? What has he thought?
*  You know, I honestly, I don't talk to Eric much anymore, so I don't know.
*  All right. OK, well, let's back up.
*  I would have said this and I will have said this in the introduction, but we've been talking
*  about you changing your mind and there's a before and after.
*  And do you want to just summarize?
*  You might be just so sick of summarizing this.
*  But what is it that you changed your mind about?
*  So we did an experiment where we well, to back up, I've long been fascinated by the
*  work of Kareem Nader, and I always thought it would be fantastic to be able to look at
*  memory reconsolidation on a synaptic level and to see later on if you induced
*  reconsolidation, would the synapses that were strengthened or grew, would they retract?
*  I mean, that that seemed to me the logical.
*  That would be the logical outcome of that.
*  And for a long time, I wanted to do that experiment, but I didn't have the people or
*  the resources to do it.
*  And when I say do that experiment in a plesio, you can take the sensory and motor neurons
*  that mediate the defensive withdrawal reflex, which was the reflex that's been the center
*  of most of the investigations of learning memory in a plesio.
*  You can take those sensory neurons and motor neurons out of the animal and you can put
*  them into cell culture.
*  They will reform their synaptic connections.
*  And somewhat remarkably, those synaptic connections in the dish have all of the forms
*  of synaptic plasticity, learning related synaptic plasticity that you see in the animal.
*  So that that means that you can do studies of synaptic plasticity in the dish and have
*  confidence that what you're seeing is what's going on in the animal.
*  And there have been a lot of studies that show that that that's the case.
*  So the experiment that I wanted to do was induce synaptic memory reconsolidation of
*  synapses and culture and then look to see if the when you block memory reconsolidation
*  by treating the cultures with the protein synthesis inhibitor and reactivating the
*  synapses, would the synapses that grew during the memory be erased?
*  So that's what I wanted to do.
*  And the way you train a synapsing culture is that you apply five pulses, five minute
*  pulses of serotonin to the sensory motor synapsing culture.
*  The reason for using serotonin is because due to the work of Candel and his colleagues
*  over several decades, it's known that serotonin is the neurotransmitter that's released
*  during behavioral sensitization.
*  And that is, you know, it plays a major role in sensitization.
*  So and the reason for using space pulses is because that gives you long term.
*  And by long term, I mean, 24 hours or more memory.
*  If you put mass pulses of serotonin, you don't get memory that lasts 24 hours.
*  And in this case, the memory is the strengthening, the long term strengthening of
*  the synapse. And you can measure that electrode with electrodes.
*  You can measure the strength of the synapse.
*  So the experiment we did was we induced long term, the synaptic analog of long term
*  sensitization with serotonin.
*  The synaptic analog is called long term facilitation.
*  So the synapse becomes facilitated and that facilitation can last 24 hours or more.
*  In the dish.
*  And then in the dish.
*  And then 24 hours later, we gave a single pulse of serotonin to some of the cell culture
*  dish. And that was the reminder stimulus that reactivated the synaptic memory.
*  That was the idea.
*  And then in some of the synapses that got the reminder pulses serotonin, we followed
*  that with application of a protein synthesis inhibitor to the cell culture dish.
*  So that's a NISA mysis.
*  So that is the reconsolidation blockade protocol.
*  And what we reported was that when we tested the synapse 48 hours after the original
*  training, just as Kareem Nader had shown in RATS and other people had shown, the
*  synaptic memory was gone.
*  So the synapse had reverted to its original strength.
*  So then we wanted to do the next experiment, which is to actually look at the synapses
*  and see if they disappear when we do the reconsolidation blockade.
*  So we did morphological analogs of this experiment.
*  So we would fill the motor sensory and motor neuron with fluorescent dyes and then using,
*  just imaging the neurons in culture, we could count the number of synaptic connections.
*  And the way the stand in for synaptic connection we use were these presynaptic barricostides
*  that are on the sensory neurons.
*  People who work on mammals call them presynaptic futons.
*  We call them barricostides.
*  Don't ask me, don't ask me why the difference in terminology.
*  I never, I never found out.
*  But anyway, so we counted, we imaged the culture, counted the number of barricostides.
*  Then we gave the five times, we gave the five pulses of serotonin.
*  24 hours later, we counted the barricostides and then again, and then some of the barricostides,
*  we, some of the synapses, we gave the reconsolidation blockade protocol.
*  So we gave a pulse of serotonin followed by a nesomyosin.
*  And then at 48 hours, we recounted the barricostides.
*  And, you know, to my great satisfaction, what we found was that indeed the number of these
*  presynaptic barricostides, which reflect synapses, they strengthened at the 24 hours after the
*  serotonin treatment.
*  And then for the synapses that got the reconsolidation blockade treatment, they went down to their
*  original value.
*  Now, it's important to note that they didn't disappear.
*  You didn't wipe out all the synaptic connections.
*  You they just reverted to their original number.
*  So there you have reconsolidation blockade in addition.
*  So, you know, usually it's a good idea to stop when you're ahead, but we didn't do that.
*  So he said, because because we could, we asked the question, well, do the barricostides that
*  get eliminated, are they the same ones that grew in response to the serotonin?
*  Because of memories contained at the synapse, that's what you'd predict.
*  So we were able to look and follow individual barricostides in cell culture over time.
*  And what we found was that it was totally random.
*  So the very some of the barricostides that grew in response to the serotonin retracted, but so did
*  some of the original barricostides.
*  And it looked like the synapses were totally uncoded with respect to memory.
*  The only thing that mattered was the number.
*  So at first, I didn't believe this result, frankly.
*  And so I made my research associate repeat, repeat it, you know, just to make sure it was right.
*  And these were very tedious experiments.
*  So anyway, she did that.
*  And then I got convinced.
*  So then I thought, well, what is this me?
*  And I thought, well, you know, it sounds like the synapses aren't where the memory is.
*  The memory is back in the cell body somewhere.
*  And the synapses are simply a reflection of the memory back in the cell body.
*  So we'd also been doing some experiments because I was very interested in the idea that epigenetic
*  changes are involved in memory.
*  And so we did experiments in which we tested the effects of DNA methylation inhibitors
*  on again on long term facilitation in the dish.
*  But we also looked at long.
*  We did behavioral.
*  We did behavioral.
*  We did behavioral corollary behavioral experiments looking at the effect of inhibiting DNA methylation
*  on long term sensitization.
*  And both sets of studies gave us the same result.
*  If you train an animal and then immediately inject an inhibitor of DNA methylation, the
*  memory goes away and we can't bring it back.
*  If we do one of the things we found was that if you do reconsolidation blockade and test
*  the animal 24 hours later, it looks like the memory is gone.
*  But you can bring the memory back with reduced training, training that by itself doesn't
*  produce long term memory.
*  But in trained animals in which you induced reconsolidation blockade, this truncated training
*  gives you long term memory.
*  It's kind of a reminder to the organism that this is what you used to do.
*  Yeah.
*  And so to the, putting all these things together, I thought, well, it looks like what's going
*  on is the nucleus is remembering and the synapse is a reflection of that memory.
*  It's a functional reflection of the memory.
*  So that that was what I started thinking.
*  And then I thought to myself, well, what could be inducing the memory?
*  And it was known that one of the things that is known that non-coding RNA can induce epigenetic
*  change.
*  So I thought, well, maybe what happens when you train the animal, it induces, it causes
*  the expression of non-coding RNA.
*  The non-coding RNA produce epigenetic changes and that's the long term memory.
*  So I was aware from my background in psychology that there were experiments done in the 1960s
*  showing that you could transfer memory from one animal to another by injecting RNA from
*  a trained animal into a naive animal.
*  Now those experiments are notorious.
*  And they basically, if you read the introductory psychology textbooks or neuroscience textbooks,
*  they always talk about this as a wrong turn in behavioral neuroscience.
*  These are planaria?
*  Is that?
*  Well, they were done initially in planaria, but then people did similar experiments in
*  goldfish and mice and rats.
*  And the problem was some people reported success and other people reported failure.
*  And eventually the idea died out and the synaptic idea of memory became predominant.
*  So I decided, okay, well, look, we're going to train an aplasia, we're going to sensitize
*  a whole animal.
*  We're going to extract the RNA out of that animal and we're going to inject it into a
*  naive animal and see if they sensitize.
*  So I got really excited about this experiment and I went to my lab members in my laboratory
*  and told them, let's do this experiment.
*  And they didn't.
*  Why not?
*  What was wrong with it?
*  They thought it was a waste of time, frankly.
*  So anyway, so eventually though they came around and they said, okay, we'll give it
*  a try.
*  So they did it and it worked.
*  Let me just summarize what that was.
*  So you train some aplasia to do a task or to be sensitized.
*  What is it called?
*  The siphon withdrawal reflex.
*  Okay, so it's trained, it's sensitized to that.
*  And then you extract its RNA, the trained conditioned trained organism, aplasia.
*  And then you inject that into other naive animals that have not been trained.
*  And all of a sudden they show the same sensitization.
*  Well we tested them 24 hours after the end training.
*  Well yes, and all of a sudden, yeah, sorry.
*  24 hours later, they show the same sensitization.
*  Whereas when you inject saline or a control basically into other untrained aplasia, they
*  do not show that sensitization.
*  Yeah, one of the controls we use, you know, physiological solution is one of the controls.
*  But one of our controls was RNA from naive untrained aplasia.
*  That was the other.
*  Right, right.
*  Okay.
*  So the take home there is that somehow the RNA that was injected into the untrained naive
*  aplasia induced this sensitization behavior.
*  And then the bigger claim would be that it was a memory of that behavior.
*  Yes.
*  Okay, so we'll come to it like I mentioned to you beforehand, I'm all confused about
*  what memory means now.
*  You know, thinking about these things.
*  But we'll come to that.
*  Okay.
*  But I interrupted you because I just wanted to give sort of a layman summary of those.
*  No, that's basically correct.
*  Now one of the things that we also did is that we did a cellular analog of these experiments.
*  So this was done by a scientist who was a postdoc in my lab, French scientist named
*  Alexei Betakarets.
*  And what he did were two different experiments.
*  One he took sensory neurons, isolated sensory neurons and cell culture and treated them
*  with either saline RNA from trained aplasia or RNA from untrained aplasia.
*  And what he found is when he tested the animals the next day, they were hyper excitable, meaning
*  that the amount of current that you needed to inject into the neurons to trigger an action
*  potential was lower.
*  And also sensory neurons, it's a little technical, but sensory neurons, when you give them a
*  long depolarizing current pulse of aplasia, sensory neurons fire at the start of the pulse,
*  but then they remain depolarized, but they don't fire.
*  And in sensitized animals, if you put a depolarizing current pulse, they fire throughout the current
*  pulse.
*  And we found that the sensory neurons that were treated with the trained RNA, but not
*  the control RNA, showed that same effect.
*  As long as they were depolarized, they fired action potentials.
*  So that was a cellular analog of behavioral sensitization that you see.
*  Jack Byrne and others had shown that you see this in sensitized animals.
*  So then we also looked to see if we would get long term synaptic facilitation using
*  the trained RNA.
*  And there our results were ambiguous.
*  So what happened was some of the synapses showed large changes and other synapses showed
*  no change.
*  change, but the variance was much larger, significantly larger than we saw in the control
*  animals.
*  So we didn't quite know what to make of that.
*  But basically we weren't able to replicate the synaptic effect of sensitization, but
*  something was going on because, as I said, the variance was much larger in the synapses
*  that got the treated RNA.
*  So, and I believe the effect was specific to sensory neurons and was not in motor neurons,
*  correct?
*  Yes, correct.
*  What does that tell you?
*  Well, in general, you don't see motor neurons increase their excitability with sensitization.
*  So that's similar to what you see in the animal.
*  So it's more like a quicker pipeline to the response via the sensory neurons or something?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  OK, so let's see, where do I start?
*  Where do I start?
*  So, you know, kind of zooming out then.
*  So you've obtained all this evidence that learning and memory that the synapse is not
*  where the action is, that it must be intracellular.
*  And to your liking, it's within the nucleus, within epigenetic DNA methylation changes.
*  It could also be genetic.
*  In other words, there's a type of genetic change called retrotransposition.
*  And we're investigating now whether learning in a plesia involves retrotransposition.
*  So it actually could be, so retrotransposition is when, I mean, if you're familiar with it,
*  typically it's, I mean, it's when a non-coding RNA is expressed and then it's reverse transcribed
*  by reverse transcriptase and then inserted back into the DNA.
*  Typically it's, you know, it's inserted into a different place.
*  Often it's inserted into motor regions of genes.
*  So this is something that has been documented in the central nervous system.
*  Fred Gage at UCSD, sorry, at the Salk Institute has shown that myos-pups that are maternally
*  deprived, there's an increase in retrotransposition in neurons of the hippocampus.
*  And we think the same thing is happening during learning.
*  And we're looking at that right now.
*  So you could have two types of changes.
*  You could have epigenetic changes, but you could also have genetic changes and those
*  could encode the memory.
*  Just to be clear, we're talking about long-term memories here, correct?
*  Yes, we are.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Because that's short-term memory.
*  Yeah, that encoding takes time.
*  And the idea is that you need a more permanent kind of storage for this long-term memory.
*  Correct, correct.
*  Okay, so, well, I mean, how just in a very general broad sense, how has this changed
*  your worldview about learning and memory?
*  I mean, I know that there's the old sort of dogma story about synaptic learning and memory.
*  And in fact, when I was interviewing for graduate school, one of the interviewees just sat me
*  down and said, so what do you think?
*  Is plasticity important for learning and memory?
*  And of course, like any good student, well, I hope so, according to the textbooks.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, let's first talk about how it's kind of just changed your overarching worldview
*  of learning and memory and just cognition as a whole.
*  So it's interesting to think about that this was a view of many prominent neuroscientists
*  back in the 60s.
*  So many prominent neuroscientists, not just McConnell, he's the one who's the best known,
*  but many prominent neuroscientists were very taken with the idea that memory is encoded
*  molecularly as a molecule.
*  And that idea didn't survive, but it's starting to make a comeback.
*  It didn't survive because of the plasticity stuff in the 70s, which came to the fore,
*  and then arguments, evidence for and against the molecular memory mechanisms, right?
*  Yeah.
*  But I think there's a larger problem.
*  There's a scientist, a biologist by the name of Gunter Stenn, who wrote an article on scientific
*  prematurity.
*  He discussed several examples of ideas that had come along in science, but didn't survive.
*  And they didn't survive because the scientific groundwork wasn't there.
*  And if you think about this molecular encoding idea, many people suspected that it was RNA.
*  But back in the 60s, nobody knew about non-coding RNA.
*  No one knew about retrotransposition.
*  To the extent that people thought that RNA might be encoding memory, they thought that
*  memory was encoded by the base pairs of the RNA, just by analogy with genetic encoding
*  in DNA.
*  And that idea is almost certainly wrong.
*  You say now, but who knows?
*  No, I don't think that idea is correct.
*  But you know, it could be.
*  I mean, I don't know because I don't know what the actual mechanism is.
*  And so if you compare that with the synaptic idea, the synaptic idea had all the elements
*  in place.
*  Not only did they have the sufficient knowledge to envision what a synaptic change would be
*  But they also had the tools and the technology to record changes in synaptic strength.
*  So if you compare that to the molecular folks, they didn't have RNA-seq.
*  So how could they figure it out?
*  So I think it was partly, I think it was, this is an example of scientific premature.
*  And now we have the tools and we have some, we have a much richer idea of molecules that
*  could encode memory, particularly RNA, or at least maybe RNA might not encode it, but
*  it induces the changes that do encode it.
*  And so I think the time is right for a reinvestigation of this idea.
*  And people now are reporting changes in inherited, people are reporting inherited memory in C
*  elegans and mice.
*  And in several cases, those, their RNA is involved in the inherited memory.
*  It's one of the mechanisms for the inherited memory.
*  So the idea is an organism learns something that induces the expression of non-coding
*  RNA that gets into the blood and that produces epigenetic changes in, for example, the sperm.
*  And so that's been documented.
*  And so I think that's another, I think that's another case where this idea about molecular
*  encoding of memory is coming back.
*  So this is, you know, frankly, you asked how this has changed my worldview.
*  I almost never read articles on synaptic plasticity.
*  I'm totally bored with them.
*  And I find myself reading articles on RNA and the effects of RNA on memory and retro
*  transposition and those things.
*  Are you bored with those synaptic plasticity articles or disgusted by them or they're no
*  use to you?
*  No, no, I just think they're, I just think unlike, I think Randy Galstel and I disagree
*  on, we agree on many things, but I think one of the things we disagree with is whether or not
*  synaptic plasticity has any role in memory.
*  Right.
*  And he just doesn't think that it does.
*  And to me, it's inconceivable that it doesn't play a role, that synaptic plasticity doesn't
*  play a role in memory.
*  I mean, we can show in a palesia, I mean, it was shown by Eric Kandel back in the 70s,
*  that when animals learn there were synaptic changes, the synaptic changes correlated with
*  the memory and they were, you know, it's just, there's no way that those are simply
*  phenomenologically non-functional changes.
*  Where I differ from most of my colleagues is I don't believe that that's the encoding
*  mechanism.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  So, okay, well, let's, but then you have to appreciate that there is a role for synaptic
*  plasticity.
*  The curious thing to me is that you're just, you know, uninterested in the synaptic plasticity
*  story now, because at this point, I think I've even, you've written about this idea, well,
*  you know, how are we going to connect plasticity then to these intracellular mechanisms?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not, look, yep.
*  It's not that I don't think they play a role.
*  And I do think that it's really important to understand, you know, if memory is encoded
*  molecularly as I believe back in the nucleus, then there has to be a mechanism whereby the
*  nucleus is regulating the synaptic strength.
*  There has to be some mechanism.
*  So that I'm very interested in, that I'm very interested in.
*  But first we have to figure out what, in order to answer that question, we first have to
*  figure out what the encoding is, because we don't know right now.
*  So it's, so that's what I'm focused on.
*  That's why I say synaptic plasticity bores me because the people who are doing synaptic
*  plasticity studies, they're not interested in this communication between the cell body
*  and the nucleus in the synapse.
*  They're simply interested in the synaptic change as synaptic change.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  I'm going to, I was going to ask you this later, but I'm going to, I'll ask it now,
*  but because when we talk about, excuse me, like a synaptic change, let's say a memory,
*  right?
*  Or the encoding of a memory, we think about like one synapse.
*  And then there must be some, so then there's a presynaptic activity.
*  It goes to the post synapse.
*  And then, then according to your story, according to the RNA or nuclear or genetic story, then
*  somehow there's an encoding of that association or that activity associated with that memory
*  into the genome.
*  But in reality, so this is just one slice of the complexity of our brains, right?
*  Yeah.
*  There are tons of different ways that we can do that.
*  Right.
*  And of course we're just in constant motion throughout the day, learning different ways
*  of moving, et cetera.
*  And so presumably then you would have to have, you know, you kind of picture it as like one,
*  one mechanism.
*  All right.
*  I'll remember that, that cell over there.
*  I'll remember that axon over there because I need to.
*  Yeah.
*  But really what it would have to be is I'll remember these 10,000 axons and I'll have
*  to encode all of that genome in my genome or in my brain.
*  All of that genome in my genome or epigenetically or something.
*  I mean, is that, does that bother you?
*  Is that feasible?
*  Is that.
*  It definitely bothers me.
*  Is it feasible?
*  I don't think anyone knows.
*  I mean, I think in principle, yes, I think it is feasible.
*  And also the other thing to remember is, you know, you know, people say, well, each neuron
*  has 10,000 synapses.
*  So the nucleus is going to have to know 10,000.
*  And really the reality is probably more like hundreds.
*  And that's still a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  And so I know that that's not beyond the capacity with the capacity of computation with
*  with the nucleotides, but that's right.
*  No one's no one's shown that yet.
*  Okay.
*  And I think to me, that's something that's that would be, you know, really important
*  to show that what I'd like to do the experiment, but unfortunately, I don't have the resource
*  to do that experiment is to repeat our experiment, but just simply show that two different synapses
*  onto the same neuron can be altered.
*  Yeah.
*  By kind of push and pull.
*  Yeah.
*  Correct.
*  Using those mechanisms.
*  And then that would make it feasible.
*  I mean, the problem is my colleagues just dismiss this possibility out of me.
*  Many of them do.
*  And I take it very seriously because I think that the cell really is the cognitive unit.
*  People talk about neural networks and I, you know, I agree there are neural networks,
*  but I actually think the cell is a cognitive unit.
*  I know plenty of people who would still agree with you, despite the story of modern neuroscience.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, okay.
*  So there's the thing is there's so many different levels, right, of organization.
*  And the more we discover, let's say even about the structure of dendritic trees or something,
*  right?
*  Oh, it's more complex than we thought.
*  The structure of networks.
*  Oh, they're more complex than we thought.
*  And then the structure, the networks within a cell.
*  Oh, it's more complex than we thought.
*  And there are all of these levels of organization.
*  And then, okay, so then I'm just going to immediately jump back to what the hell is
*  a memory because there's memory in the sense of like a subjective kind of, you know,
*  the experience of recalling something, right?
*  Let's say.
*  Yeah.
*  But then there's the storage of memory.
*  There's the retrieval of memory, the expression of memory.
*  Yes.
*  And so often when I'm reading work that is talking about these encoding mechanisms on
*  the intracellular level and they call it a memory, does it need to be called a memory
*  or is it, it's like that bit is part of a memory perhaps.
*  Or like, where do we stop talking?
*  Where do we start talking about a memory?
*  Like at what level?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a very good question.
*  I think that's a, that's a, the answer to that is really complicated.
*  Let me, let me go.
*  Before I get to that, let me go back to this idea of the cells.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  You bet.
*  I like this idea by the way.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So if you think about it, cells were around for billions of years before the nervous system
*  came along.
*  And the question is whether non-neural organisms have memory.
*  And people have, at our meeting, there were people who talked about memory like phenomena
*  and plants and Wade Marshall at UCSF is looking at memory in stentor, which is a unicellular
*  organism.
*  He's shown a bit to a which is memory.
*  I mean, you know, I think that, well, that's another issue.
*  We can go into, but it's memory.
*  And so if single celled organisms, if non-neural organisms can have forms of learning that,
*  you know, we, everyone agrees are learning like, you know, sensitization, habituation
*  and classical conditioning.
*  Well, when the metazoans came along and nervous systems appeared, did they just jettison those
*  ancient mechanisms of memory?
*  That just seems impossible to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I just don't believe that.
*  That's not the way I think evolution works.
*  And so somehow the synaptic mechanisms of memory became integrated with these non-synaptic
*  mechanisms in some way.
*  And the question is how?
*  To me, that's the question.
*  How?
*  And if we knew that, then we would know, we would be a long way towards answering this
*  question you ask is how does the nucleus, you know, how does the nucleus know what's
*  going on at the center?
*  Somehow the synaptic, the nervous system mechanisms of memory, neural mechanisms of memory, if
*  you will, became integrated with the non-neural mechanisms.
*  And I think that that's persisted to this day in us.
*  And so if we knew how that happened, then we could answer a lot of these questions,
*  functional questions about memory.
*  Now, the question you ask about what is memory, that's, that is a really difficult question.
*  And you'll get different answers from different people.
*  So some people will only say it's memory if you can show it, if it's associative and you
*  can show it in a mammal.
*  And then other people will say it's like a crease in a piece of paper is memory, you
*  know, it's a persistence.
*  So other people-
*  Molecules in a rock are memory.
*  Yeah, right, right.
*  So, you know, to me, to answer that question, I guess I would say if it's functionally related
*  to a form of learning, then I would say it's memory.
*  Well, then you have to ask what learning is also.
*  Well, okay.
*  So with learning, I'm pretty much of a classicist.
*  So I look at, you know, the standard ideas about learning.
*  So, you know, evituation, sensitization, classical conditioning, it's Gnarian conditioning,
*  and then other forms of declarative memory, which, you know, that's, those are quite
*  complicated, obviously.
*  Well, going back to the idea of the, you know, a single cell as a unit of cognition,
*  and, you know, I leapt and said, oh, I really like that idea, which I do.
*  However, I think that's true.
*  And it's also not true at a different level, right?
*  So my whole organism, my brain and whole organism learns to play baseball and can
*  remember how to swing a bat in my single cell doesn't know anything about it.
*  Right.
*  So that's a different level of organization and memory, which so to, I don't know,
*  just sometimes when I'm reading the literature, we all do this use words like learning and
*  intelligence and things like that.
*  Sure.
*  So that's a unit of cognition, right?
*  But so am I, right?
*  Some sort of unit of cognitions and how to reconcile those two things while using the
*  same term.
*  Well, you have to understand when you say a single cell doesn't know how to hit a baseball,
*  that's true, but you don't know what role the single cell has in hitting a baseball.
*  And that's because there's a lot that your consciousness is not aware of that's going
*  on.
*  Yeah.
*  And so, you know, these days I have to say that I think the idea that there is a person
*  with a unique personality with coherent behavior called David Glansman, I think that's a kind
*  of useful fiction that my brain tells my body in order to get coherent behavior.
*  So I really think you're basically a colony of billions of little conscious units.
*  Yeah.
*  And somehow that produces coherent behavior.
*  And I would not have said that 10 years ago.
*  So that's another way in which my worldview has changed.
*  Do you know-
*  Somebody after I said, I made this statement at this meeting we just had pushing the
*  boundaries.
*  And two people came up to me afterwards and said, you know, that's what the Buddhists
*  believe.
*  The Buddhists believe the same thing.
*  And I'm going off, I didn't know that because, you know, I never paid any attention to
*  religion.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Everyone who studies consciousness ends up in Buddhism, apparently.
*  Yeah, I guess so.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess even if you're not aware that you're ending up in Buddhism.
*  Right.
*  Well, I mean, you said consciousness, which is, let's not go off on that tangent, I guess.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Right.
*  Do you know who William B. Miller is?
*  He's a-
*  No, I don't.
*  But he has the same view of like the, he really elevates the status of the cell as an
*  individual unit that has lots of intelligence.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And I think it's-
*  I'm going to look at his stuff because that's exactly the-
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  That's exactly the viewpoint I'm moving towards.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's difficult to talk about because we're using these single terms and we're
*  really talking about different levels of organization.
*  Yes.
*  So when I say, so when you say memory, like to me, it means like, you know,
*  lots of, let's say it's encoded in the nucleus, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Like the synaptic structures are encoded in the nucleus, the tags with the IDs.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the memory is not the thing that's encoded.
*  That's like the IDs and like the little things that are required to get the MIP to express
*  the memory.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yes. That does. That makes perfect sense. I mean, in a way, I guess, I mean, you could,
*  couldn't you say that about any mechanistic change?
*  Yes.
*  Couldn't you say the synaptic change, you could say exactly the same thing about,
*  there's nothing special from the viewpoint you're looking at.
*  So the synaptic change and people say, well, there are more dendrites and, you know, it's
*  the same thing. And so the, the memory then you would have to be an outside observer and say,
*  oh, that's that epiphenomenon, that summary of all those tiny,
*  functional mechanistic changes. That's memory, right?
*  I mean, there wouldn't be anything.
*  I mean, I'm trying to think, is there any thing that you could look at and say, oh, that's memory
*  without knowing what the functional product of those changes were?
*  Yeah. I mean, it's all behavior. You always have to express the behavior.
*  I think so.
*  Well, okay. Let's go down this road then. So you've made a conscious decision or a conscious
*  decision, a decision, your trillions of cells made a decision that
*  I would say a professionally somewhat suicidal decision.
*  Well, that's another thing I was going to ask if your favorite poem is
*  what is it? Robert Frost to two paths diverge the road less traveled, right?
*  Is that the poem?
*  Yeah.
*  Yes. Unfortunately, if you want to be a scientist, you have to get funding for your research.
*  How's that going for you?
*  That's going not really well. So, so I, yeah, I know. So I tell this story. I told this story
*  at the meeting. So our paper is, do you know altmetric scores of papers?
*  You know what that is?
*  No, no.
*  Oh, I'm surprised. Okay. So now these altmetric is a way of keeping an index of the social
*  attention that your papers are getting. So it scores tweets, blogs, news articles,
*  and there's some algorithm and it comes up with a score for you, for your paper.
*  Yay.
*  Yeah. So yes. And so you will, I want you to cite my favorite because that's going to boost my
*  altmetric score. But anyway, my art, the altmetric score for that 2018 memory transfer paper is,
*  is it, it, it varies on each given day, but for the last five years, more or less, it's been the
*  number as the number one altmetric score for any paper published in Eden Europe as it's in the top
*  1% of papers published in the field and at that time, and it's in the top 5% of all scientific
*  papers period. Okay. Now you think that that would translate into some kind of funding.
*  One would-
*  Okay. Yeah. Well, that, okay. That's a good point. Yeah.
*  But it absolutely had the opposite effect on my funding. So when I published in 2018,
*  my lab had, I had two RO1s and an NSF and I went from that to zero.
*  I went to zero funding and so eventually I, and this, I have to give NSF credit for this. They
*  have given me a couple of grants to look at RNA and memory and also this memory transfer,
*  and that's to their credit. Cause there's no way I could, it's clear to me that I could not get this
*  funded by NIH. The problem is that NSF grants are smaller than NIH grants. So my lab has contracted
*  quite a bit. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. And this is also the kind of work that you actually need
*  a lot of person hours, et cetera. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I'm totally grateful to NSF. It's just
*  that I couldn't keep the lab that I have going with NSF funding below. So you're going to try
*  to bring your, that metric down, that social media metric. I think you should try to bring it down.
*  I mean, you should try to get canceled, get canceled in social media.
*  They can't be related though, right? But there must be like,
*  No, no, no, it's not related. No, no, no. There are plenty of people who have,
*  whose papers have high altmetric scores that are well funded. It's just, it's just kind of,
*  I just consider it somewhat ironic that a lot of people consider this paper to be important.
*  And NIH just doesn't consider it to be important at all. So no, not important enough to put money
*  into it. What are your current thoughts? So I was going to ask you this later. I'm going to,
*  I'm going to ask you now, like then since we're on the topic.
*  But I want to say something about this because there's, I don't know if you're familiar with
*  this, but there was a paper that came out in nature in January and it plotted the
*  ratio of so-called disruptive scientific publications. These are publications that
*  eventually changed the field and they use a metric, an algorithm to decide whether paper is disruptive
*  and typically it's disruptive if it starts out with a very low citation rate and then gradually
*  gets stronger and stronger. The ratio of that over the last 50 years has declined dramatically.
*  The ratio of that to non-disruptive.
*  Yes.
*  But is it normalized by just the sheer volume of publications as well?
*  Well, that's the point. So it turns out the number of disruptive papers has more or less remained,
*  the absolute numbers remain constant in a field, but the ratio as a percentage of the publication
*  has declined dramatically. Also the number of new patents has declined dramatically in various fields.
*  One way to interpret that is that there's too much money being put into science.
*  Yeah, that's one way to interpret it. The other way to interpret it is say, well, look,
*  there's a fixed number of creative people in the world and those drive the field and there's a whole
*  bunch of other people who are doing stuff that's just really unnecessary in the field. The fields
*  can remain healthy as long as you have this fixed number of creative people. So some people have
*  said, well, there's no problem here. There's always going to be new ideas coming along, but
*  a lot of people think it really is a problem. And part of this, and of course, people are trying
*  to figure out what's the reason for this, but to me it's almost certainly the case that some of it
*  is due to the funding mechanisms that are available for science. You can't do science without money.
*  And the peer review system is a fantastic system. It's resulted in America becoming
*  the greatest scientific enterprise in the world, but it's not very good at supporting
*  radically new ideas. In a sense, you can think, well, if you have a radically new idea in a field,
*  you don't have any peers anymore. You're outside your peers. And so peer review is going to fail
*  at that point. Are you worried that you're going to become a starving artist?
*  I started out as a starving artist. That's what I am right now.
*  And I may end up as a starving artist. When I was a young man, I lived in a tenement,
*  literally a tenement apartment on the Lower East Side in New York. And I was working as a messenger
*  boy for a film company. I paid $66 a month rent for my apartment. And it probably wasn't even
*  worse, $66 a month. I don't know. Maybe the rats thought so.
*  Yeah. Well, the cockroaches did and I even had bed bugs.
*  Oh. But seriously, does this worry you about continuing a lab moving forward?
*  It will continue in a lab definitely. But you also have to understand that I'm in a
*  kind of privileged position. I'm a full professor at a major research university and
*  I have tenure. And so at least I'll be able to go to work every day. But I do, yes, it bothers me a
*  lot. The frank answer to that is yes, it bothers me a lot.
*  I mean, there's the other issue of just momentum in science, because if you don't get funding,
*  right, things kind of come to a slowdown and then you kind of lose the thread of what you're doing
*  and it's hard to restart, right? Well, it's not only that. I mean, people,
*  one of the metrics that people use when they're deciding whether or not to fund you is your rate
*  of publication. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. You got to start writing a bunch of opinion pieces.
*  Yeah. Well, sorry to hear that the funding is not going up. Do you have advice then for,
*  you know, I've often had people, I remember like Paul Cizek saying, you know, because he's a
*  cognitive science person, neuroscience person, and he's kind of going off in this tangent in his
*  career about how following the path, reverse engineering evolutionary stages to help us
*  understand cognition and what brain areas we're doing and how they led to what we're doing now,
*  etc. And he's super interested in it, but he gave a word of warning, you know, to like, well,
*  you can't go too far off the beaten path because you need feedback from your cohorts, and then you
*  might not make it back, right? But in your case, this is the path. This is the, and you feel
*  confident about it. Yeah, I feel confident. And the other thing is that there are people out there
*  who are moving in the same direction. Yeah. So Sam Gershman, you know, Randy Gallisdell,
*  he doesn't have a lab as far as I know, but he's still, you know, still very active.
*  And Colleen Murphy is working on memory transfer. Yeah, Jeannette inherited memory,
*  but she also showed, she also showed lateral transfer of memory in C. elegans,
*  you know, that she showed by RNA. So there are people moving in this direction. And so that
*  excites me. So I don't feel like I'm this person who's shouting in the wilderness. It's just that
*  I have new colleagues now. So that's, you know, I don't, you know, I just have different colleagues.
*  And it's not as big a number, obviously, because there aren't a lot of people in this,
*  moving in this direction. But the idea that there's learning in single cells,
*  Wade Marshall's work and the people who are looking at learning, Audrey Dussuteur, who's French,
*  works on learning and slime mold, she's shown really quite clearly that slime molds obituate.
*  So, you know, there are people who are in this area. And to me, that's really exciting. So what
*  I'm trying to do is, is promote that area as much as possible. It'll come around again, right?
*  It always does. Yeah, that's it always does. A moment ago, you mentioned how
*  when you're doing when you're off on your own doing something or when it's a radical new idea,
*  right? But this is not and then before that, you mentioned that this there's historical precedent
*  for this. And that it got replaced quote unquote, by the synaptic plasticity hypothesis. Why? And
*  you mentioned that in textbooks, you know, they maybe mentioned that and say, well, this was the
*  wrong idea. This was the wrong path. And I don't remember, I don't even remember this, when I was
*  learning about learning and memory. And maybe maybe there was something like that. But there
*  are so many ideas that seem to come back when, like you said, the technology is available for
*  actually studying it and in a reasonable, intractable manner. Why aren't ideas like
*  that presented as alternatives in the beginning to students who are because we're just taught dogma
*  most frequently, right? Yeah. But why isn't it given some sort of, at least in the path of ideas,
*  and given some historical context that the story has not always been just synaptic plasticity,
*  right? Yeah, that's, I think that's a difficult question to answer. You know, there's a there's
*  a saying I heard once that the problem with having to open a mind is that your brains might fall out.
*  Good.
*  You know, I think scientists are very keyed in to figuring out the truth. And so, in order to do
*  that, you have to discard a lot of non-ideas that you think are non-truth. And I don't think it's,
*  I don't think you can have to open a mind when you're trying to push a field forward. You know,
*  scientists don't generally say, oh, I think it's this, but you know, it could be this,
*  or it could be that, or it could be that. You know, that's not the way scientific papers are
*  written. And to a large extent, that's not the way textbooks are written. Although there, you know,
*  you have a certain amount of freedom to speculate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the, you
*  know, I think that's the, you know, do you know, if not, some advice, you know who he was?
*  You jog my memory. If I'm not, maybe not. Yeah.
*  Ignat Semmelweis was obstetrician at the major hospital in Vienna during the 1850s. And at that
*  time, women died a lot of childbirth, a fever infection during childbirth. And somehow,
*  Semmelweis came up with the idea that this was caused by putrefaction that was under the
*  fingernails of surgeons because they would dissect corpses and then they would go up and deliver baby.
*  I do know who this is. I know the name. I know the story.
*  And he noticed that his fingers smelled badly when he finished dissecting the corpse. So he
*  experimented with solutions that would get rid of that smell. And what he came up with was a weak
*  solution of carbolic acid. So thereafter, whenever he did dissections, before he delivered babies,
*  he would wash his hands. And he insisted that all the other surgeons on obstetricians on his ward
*  do the same thing. And the rate of death of women on his maternity ward decreased to almost zero.
*  So Semmelweis presented his findings to the Viennese Medical Society, and
*  they were outraged because he was claiming that they were killing their patient.
*  So they basically didn't renew his contract. He had to go back to his hometown of Budapest,
*  and he continued to document the effect of simply washing your hands. Now, the problem was this was
*  before the germ theory. So nobody had a mechanism. All he had was data. So in order to convince people,
*  he published a monograph, and it was semi-hysterical. And he basically
*  accused all the doctors in Europe of being murdered.
*  Well, there's a political aspect to this.
*  Yeah. So this didn't make him popular. And his wife, who was a socialite,
*  was very unhappy with him. And she thought he was exhibiting unstable behavior, which he probably
*  was. And so she tricked him into going to a psychiatric institute. And when he realized
*  that he was in a psychiatric institute, he tried to get out, and he was beaten by the warders,
*  and he died. He was effectively beaten to death. And then, of course, 20 years later, Liston
*  Lister, a passenger, came along, and they came up with a mechanism for what he had found. But
*  there's no question that the scientist was right, absolutely right. So whenever I think about my
*  situation, I was thinking, well, it could be worse. It could be somewhat.
*  I know. The headline would be, Dr. Glansman dies trying to escape the asylum after claiming
*  all synaptic plasticity hypothesis advocates are murderers.
*  Thought murderers.
*  Thought murderers. Oh, that's good. I hope it doesn't come to that, of course.
*  I still have so much to ask you. I want to get back. Let's get back a little bit to the
*  science of it all. And thinking about the scale. So you, on purpose, you chose
*  simple organisms to study. And this has been the dominant organism type, simple, quote unquote,
*  with brains or nervous systems that are comprised of less than billions of neurons, for instance.
*  Well, thinking about the scale of what this would apply to, what it would imply with regards to
*  higher cognitive organisms. I have a buddy who loves Tolstoy. I love Dostoevsky. We slit our
*  arms and became blood brothers, and I still don't know Tolstoy. So what am I doing wrong,
*  is the question. But seriously, these behaviors in these organisms that get transferred,
*  which we're calling memory, are fairly sensitive, are fairly simple behaviors, sensitization,
*  reflexes, et cetera. Do you see this scaling up? What is your vision for how?
*  Okay. Yeah. So people have asked me that, and they say, okay, look, I'm willing to buy that
*  maybe habituation, sensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning can be
*  encoded molecular. I'm willing to buy that. But I'm not willing to buy that my memory of Shakespeare's
*  plays or my memory of the gift I got for my 10th birthday is encoded as a molecule. I'm just not
*  willing to buy that. And I think that's fair enough because I personally cannot imagine
*  how that kind of memory could be encoded molecularly. Having said that, I think that's
*  it. I don't see how it can be ruled out. I mean, just because I can't imagine it
*  doesn't mean that you can rule it out. If the capacity, if molecules can indeed encode
*  the complex information, then I don't think you can rule it out. Now,
*  I frankly, I personally don't spend a lot of time thinking about complex cognition. I mean,
*  I've always been a reductionist in my approach. So I'm not a reductionist in terms of the
*  application of my knowledge. So what I learn about simple organisms, I mean, so I'm very
*  focused on trying to figure out memory and so-called simple organisms. But it's important,
*  and this is something that people, I don't think in the field sufficiently grasp, is we do not have
*  a satisfactory neurobiological explanation for any form of memory in any organism. Now think about
*  that. Think about that. Okay. We cannot say how C. elegans habituates. I mean, we know a lot about
*  it, but there's a lot we don't know.
*  Lukas Hockenbach Famously, we know its entire connectome.
*  Dr. John F. Leary Yes. And that's why this connectome enterprise,
*  which is getting tons of money and attention.
*  Lukas Hockenbach Murderers.
*  Dr. John F. Leary Just kidding.
*  Dr. John F. Leary No. It's not to say that it's not important. I mean, one of the most important
*  advantages of Aplesia was we had a primitive sort of connectome of the nervous system. We didn't
*  know everything, but we knew enough. It's important, but I think many of the people working on that
*  think that the solutions to cognition and memory are going to fall out of knowledge.
*  That's certainly incorrect. That's certainly incorrect. You know, I kind of,
*  you know, this will get me in a lot of trouble, but I sometimes think the people who work on
*  connectomes are really smart people who do that in lieu of coming up with really creative,
*  profound ideas about how nervous systems work. Now that's going to get me in a lot of trouble.
*  But so if you realize that, then for me, it seems that the driving
*  ambition should be to try to figure out how a form of memory works in some organism.
*  And once you know that, then you can try to build your way up. So that's the way in which I'm a
*  reduction. It's not to say that I think that the mechanism that we find for a bit to Asian C.
*  elegans is going to be, you know, important for all forms of cognition and, you know,
*  declared of memory in humans. I don't believe that at all. It's just, if you take what I'm
*  saying seriously, then you realize how little we truly understand about the brain.
*  Yeah, it's a depressing thing.
*  I mean, if we can't figure out how to learn, if we not, we can figure it out, I'm convinced,
*  but if we don't know how learning works in C. elegans, an animal that has 325 neurons
*  and it's central nervous system, we don't know that, you know, how long is it going to take
*  before we understand cognition in humans? Just how long? Just, you know, just try to figure it out.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I'm preparing a job talk for tomorrow, actually. And it's the same old story, right? You
*  you think, oh gosh, we know nothing about the brain still and cognition. But then you look back
*  at your, I'm preparing this talk and having to go through and prepare figures, what I've done,
*  and I've done so much and I still, and you learn, you learn so much. And then mostly what you learn
*  is how much we don't know. I mean, it's just this catch 22. It keeps going.
*  When I was in my twenties, I completely, I was convinced that synaptic plasticity explained
*  learn. And I thought, okay, look, this is not going to be hard. I'm just going to figure out
*  everything there is to know about synaptic plasticity. And then I'm going to understand
*  learning. And I thought I would finish that by the certainly by the time I was 50.
*  Yeah. But what was it? Was it, was it Nader's work that what was it that sparked the change,
*  the beginning of the cream thinking about cream Nader's work really, really was the thing that,
*  I mean, it didn't cream Nader's work didn't make me think that synaptic plasticity wasn't the
*  answer, but it drove me down the path to doing the experiments that led me to where I am now.
*  Okay. Offline, before we started talking, I asked if you had any thoughts about artificial
*  intelligence, because the memory mechanisms that you're interested in are far, far different than
*  neural networks. Yes. And I think that, you know, deep learning is, is going to is,
*  it's not, it's not a bad way to teach machines. And obviously, they will learn and they will learn
*  pretty interesting things. But that's not the way the brain learns. Okay, I'm convinced of that.
*  And that's not the way the brain encodes memory. I mean, I always say, if you could show me a
*  computer that's as cognitively sophisticated as my snail, I'll be impressed. And so far,
*  there is no computer that's as sophisticated cognitively as my snail. In other words,
*  if you put a deep learning computer out in the ocean and it had, you know, let's say you
*  kept it from rusting and it had to do, deal with all the things a snail deals with,
*  a marine, it couldn't survive. It could not survive. So, until we understand
*  the real mechanisms of encoding memory, that we're not, you know, people, everybody gets all excited
*  about, you know, chat, GPT, and generative AI. And I just say, look, this is not the way humans
*  learn. This is not the way they remember. If this is not the way they remember,
*  it's unlikely it's going to replace us anytime soon.
*  Well, there's the replacing aspect, right? Which I, it's just silly to me, but it is interesting to
*  see how many people are worried about it. But then there's the, what is it, you know, it is impressive
*  as a tool and a, so what does that say about our, about our, or what does it say about what we
*  deem to be cognitively awesome, like chess and like language? I mean, does that reef configure
*  how we should be thinking about intelligence and cognition?
*  I honestly don't think so because I don't think that that's the way we do. I mean, I would,
*  rather than, look, there, there's a, a functional value to generative AI that's undeniable.
*  I mean, it's going to be able to increase our capacities enormously. But if you really want to
*  figure out how humans think and remember, this is not how they think and remember. This is just not
*  how, in my opinion, this is not how they do it. It's a very artificial system. And the kinds of
*  things it can do are increasingly sophisticated, but they're still fairly artificial,
*  in my opinion. You're, you probably are too young, but in the eighties, I think, or maybe nineties,
*  when Deep Blue beat- I think it was 97, right? Maybe?
*  Yeah. Okay. So yeah. Beat Gary Kasparov in chess. You know, everybody said, okay, well,
*  now computers are smarter than people. Yeah. Okay. So then, I think it was Nike came out with an ad
*  where they, a series of ads where they had Deep Blue in a gym playing against David Robinson.
*  And David Robinson was dunking over Deep Blue and he was stealing the ball. You know, Deep Blue was
*  just a boss in the gym. And you kids out there, David Robinson was one of the best basketball
*  players in that area. In the Deep Blue area. Yeah. Professional basketball player. The admiral.
*  They interviewed David Robinson, you know, after he played the, what do you think? And he goes,
*  well, I think he's got to work on his ball control. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. So that's what I think of,
*  what I think of generative AI. Yeah. It can do things and increasingly impressive things that
*  are not so rigid. You know, the, the, the formal demands are not as rigid as chess. They're much
*  more flexible. And so it's getting more impressive, but you know, I just simply don't believe that
*  that's how organisms learn. Well, so you turn one of those off and you can, everything stays
*  unchanged, right? The weights stay unchanged and everything's stored quote unquote in the synapses.
*  You turn it on a year later and it performs the exact same. Is the, is it just a matter of adding
*  some sort of nucleus to the units, you know, some sort of internal storage mechanism that tags
*  the connection strengths and possibly, you know, and then you can, then you can sever things and
*  it'd be okay. Yeah. I guess that is true. But then you, then I think you have to get to the big,
*  bigger question. The one that you alluded to is how do you get all these independent units to
*  cooperate? How do they cooperate? How do they know? All right. Now you might think, oh,
*  well that's easy. They're connected to each other. So it's synapse, but it turns out that neurons
*  have ways of communicating with each other non-synaptically. So I don't know if you're aware of
*  the recent findings of Jason Shepard and Vivian Budnick, but they looked at a well-known synaptic
*  protein called ARK. And ARK has been known to be involved in synaptic plasticity for 20 years and
*  it regulates AMPA receptor trafficking and it maintains synaptic strengthening. That's one of
*  things it does. Well, what Jason and Vivian Budnick found is that the ARK protein is a capsid,
*  just like HIV. Like a virus.
*  And it contains, like a virus, and it contains RNA and it shuttled between neurons non-synaptically.
*  But is it at the synapse or is it actually extra synaptically? It's from non-synaptic sites?
*  It's, that I don't know. It is at the synapse, but it can, I'm pretty sure it can be released
*  at non-synaptic sites. It seems like an efficient transfer would be at the synapse.
*  So yeah, but it's not, it's taken up by the receiving cell by endocytosis.
*  So it's released. It doesn't have anything to do with the action potential is what you're saying.
*  No, it does have something, the release does have something to do with action potentials. Whether
*  or not it can be released without action potentials, I don't know if that's clear.
*  Yeah, I meant like the synaptic strengthening and weakening at the,
*  like the pre and post synaptic mechanisms, right, that are purported to strengthen and weaken.
*  Is that what you're, it's more like just, here's some information going, the idea is like,
*  it's just a messenger kind of. Yeah. Okay. That's true, but it's RNA.
*  Yeah. Right. Right. Think about that. So it's RNA. And what if that RNA gets transported back to the
*  nucleus? And how many of these proteins does the nervous system have? And if ARC is released
*  extracellularly, then that means in principle, it can go out into the extracellular medium and
*  into the blood. So now you have activity dependent release of RNA that's getting outside the neuron
*  itself and in principle outside the brain. So what's the function of that? What's the cognitive
*  function of that? Open question.
*  Yeah. So, but going back to single cells, if single cells existed at one point, why isn't,
*  why aren't, why wouldn't RNA be a mechanism of communication among single cells? And why
*  couldn't that be used to coordinate their behavior? And the answer is there's no reason
*  why it couldn't. And it probably is, and it may well be the primitive, before there were
*  neural networks, there may be functional networks of individual cells whose behavior is coordinated
*  by release of RNA and probably other molecules as well. Yeah. All right. Sticking with the single
*  cell for a moment. So the classic textbook story is DNA encodes life, right? DNA encodes RNA,
*  encodes proteins, and that's the central dogma, which we know is there are lots of different
*  ways that can go. But my question is, so still the central story in evolution as well is that DNA
*  controls who we are and controls the cell, right? But I think I really, I love these inversions,
*  these thought experiments that are inversions. One could say that it could inverse that and say
*  it's the cell that's actually controlling the cell as a cognitive unit, let's say, that's using the
*  DNA, that's controlling the DNA. Is that a healthy way to look at it from your vantage point? So,
*  you know, this goes back to evolution. So, you know, some of the, a couple of speakers at the,
*  again, this Pushing the Boundaries meeting talked about the interaction of the environment on DNA
*  and how the changes in DNA weren't random, weren't really random. They were guided
*  by some of these mechanisms. By environmental mechanisms?
*  Yes, by environmental mechanisms. And so, that suggests that it's actually more interactive.
*  So, the DNA isn't this master switch. The DNA is acted upon by other factors. And so, I think
*  that's a more realistic view. Kind of a circular causality.
*  Yeah, right. Exactly. Yes.
*  David, in the last few minutes, I just have a couple extra questions for you, if you have time
*  for them. Sure. We've talked about your struggles walking this lonely, solitary...
*  It's not so lonely or solitary. Well, okay. Yeah, I mean, it's not exactly...
*  Okay. Instead of 10,000 friends, you have 50 in the field, something like that, right?
*  That's right. That's right. That's supposed to be.
*  What are some of the benefits, though? Do you feel... Oh, I don't want to put words in your
*  mouth. So, what is it that you gain from doing that? The benefit is I'm meeting a whole new group
*  of people and I'm very excited about their ideas. And this keeps my juices flowing.
*  Is it fun to go against the grain also? Or is that part of the fun?
*  For me, this is something I have to discuss with my therapist. But
*  it's always been difficult for me to take orders from people.
*  Yeah, me too. And so, there's probably something in me that is... There are some people who
*  just want to know where everybody else is going. They want to do the same thing, but just maybe be
*  at the front of the line, but they want to keep doing the same thing. I don't like lines.
*  Yeah. I've never been that kind of person. So, there probably is something... I'm almost certain
*  there's something about my personality that would mean that I'm the kind of person who would go this
*  way. And also, it takes a certain amount of self-confidence, which I have that as well.
*  But I just... Let's set aside the funding issue because for me, that is a serious issue because
*  I'm a laboratory scientist, so I'd like to have a lab. But I just find I'm really grateful that
*  I am going in this direction because for me, it's endlessly exciting. And I'm learning stuff
*  that I didn't know. I mean, this is kind of embarrassing, but I never took molecular biology
*  in college because I was a psychology major and I thought, what are molecules going to tell you
*  about thought? I'm going to study psychology. And so, everything comes back to bite you in the end.
*  But I'm learning all this really interesting stuff. And for me, it's really satisfying.
*  Speaking of grants, when yours gets funded, what's your vision for the future? What are
*  the next steps for you once you can go into overdrive?
*  I think it's pretty obvious. What I'm going to try to do is figure out the role of RNA and learning
*  memory. And I want to figure out is it... Is memory encoded epigenetically? Is it encoded also partly
*  genetically? What role does RNA play in nuclear encoding of memory? And how does the changes in
*  the nucleus, how does that structure the synaptic changes and keep them maintained?
*  And for me, that's what I'm interested in right now.
*  Or reconstitute them when they're not maintained.
*  Or reconstitute them when they get destroyed. I mean, we showed that when we had
*  reconsolidation blockade and we eliminated the memory, supposedly, we were able to bring it back
*  with this truncated training, well, the synapses came back too. So, that means that the synaptic
*  structure can be reconstituted. And by the way, that would give me hope if I were working on
*  Alzheimer's because in principle, if you understood that process, you could reconstruct the synapses
*  that are destroyed during memory, during Alzheimer's and retrieve the memory, get the memory back.
*  Now, of course, when the cell dies, that's it. When the neurons die, that's the end of the story.
*  But certainly for years, I think the major problem people have with memory is that the
*  synapse, there's synaptic loss. But if you could reconstruct the appropriate synapses,
*  you should be able to get the memory back. So, the memory should still be there. So,
*  for me, that's part of the future. All right, David, I'm sorry to hear that
*  you're going senile, but I've really enjoyed my time here with you. I'm joking. Sorry,
*  I had to throw it in there. No, no, no, that's totally fine.
*  No, I really appreciate it. It's a really fun conversation and I wish you the best in funding
*  and of course, keep up the good work. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I've
*  enjoyed this conversation immensely as well. Thank you for your questions. A really thoughtful,
*  very thoughtful question.
*  Thank you.
