# BI 118 Johannes JÃ¤ger: Beyond Networks
**Brain Inspired:** [November 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdQMwctgMNI)
*  They're presented as an explanation of what's going on.
*  While they don't really explain anything, right, that was one of my problems.
*  They just show that a system is complicated, basically.
*  I wouldn't even call it complex.
*  And so I became frustrated with this.
*  If you're really a process thinker, and I think that's really important here, you need
*  to let go of those fixed structures.
*  Because we can only study small aspects of development and evolution using dynamical
*  systems theory, but we cannot capture the agency of the organism.
*  It was so successful that we've just completely forgotten all the other stuff that we've thrown
*  out to make it work in the first place.
*  And it's time to get back to that because a lot of the problems we have right now are
*  in understanding our situation in the world and in understanding truly complex systems
*  that have agents in them.
*  And of course, neurosciences are completely included in that.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hello, it's Paul.
*  On the episode today, I have a chat with Johannes Jaeger, who also goes by Yogi, which is what
*  I call him during the episode.
*  On his website, Yogi bills himself as a freelance philosopher, a researcher, and an educator.
*  And he's actually done a lot of empirical research in systems science and evolutionary
*  biology, and a range of interdisciplinary topics as well.
*  The reason he's on the podcast is because I recently took his online YouTube course
*  called Beyond Networks, The Evolution of Living Systems.
*  So the course covers a lot of ground, but is roughly about how, because of the complexity
*  of us as biological organisms functioning in a highly interactive and complex environment,
*  we need to rethink evolutionary theory.
*  And Yogi makes an argument that we need to add a new perspective to evolutionary theory
*  that accommodates a role for agency as biological organisms.
*  And the course has the title Beyond Networks, because within this agential perspective,
*  we need to somehow move beyond the dynamical and mechanistic explanations that we currently
*  use to study things like gene regulatory systems, which are traditionally thought of as networks
*  of interacting genes and products of those genes, and so on.
*  So I wanted to have him on because, first of all, I really enjoyed his course, as you'll
*  hear, but also because his argument applies equally well to explaining brains, which are
*  in the same complexity realm as organisms, obviously.
*  And given that on this podcast, we often talk about using networks like deep learning networks
*  to explain intelligence, I think that Yogi's is an important message to consider.
*  So I highly recommend the course.
*  Note the term highly recommend, because fair warning, if you do watch the videos, your
*  reading list will exponentially increase with all the books and papers that he quote unquote
*  highly recommends throughout.
*  We also have a guest question from Kevin Mitchell today, who was on the podcast recently on
*  episode 111.
*  A link to Yogi's blog and website and to the course that we discuss in the show notes at

*  If you find the podcast valuable, consider supporting it on Patreon.
*  We just had our first zoom presentation and discussion group through the Discord server
*  that I run for Patreon supporters.
*  This one was about the landscape of cognitive science and it was a lot of fun.
*  So I look forward to having more of those in the future.
*  To support the show, just click the Patreon button at braininspired.co.
*  All right.
*  It was a pleasure having Yogi on and I hope that you enjoy the discussion as much as I
*  did.
*  I came on to you and in fact, we're going to talk about your online course on YouTube
*  called Beyond Networks, the Evolution of Living Systems.
*  And I'd like to say I came on to you through academic means, but I think YouTube figured
*  out that I was looking for biological autonomy topics because I had read Alvaro Moreno and
*  Matteo Masio's book on biological autonomy and I was either searching for it or YouTube
*  knew that I wanted to search for it.
*  And then that's how I came across your course, which I just want to say is I really love
*  this course and I'll probably recommend it in the introduction, but I just want to reiterate
*  that I recommend it to all my listeners to check this course out.
*  But before we talk about that, I would love for you so that I don't botch it to introduce
*  yourself and talk a little bit about your background and the empirical research that
*  you've done and then how you've sort of transitioned in your trajectory to your current thinking.
*  Well, thank you very much.
*  First of all, it's really nice to hear that the lectures are sort of reaching beyond their
*  initially intended target audience, which it was sort of accidental.
*  And that's really nice to hear.
*  I'm an evolutionary biologist, systems biologist.
*  I had for years been a researcher in the lab myself and then had an empirical, was the
*  head of an empirical lab at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Spain.
*  And I was looking at the evolution of gene regulatory networks that are involved in the
*  early development of especially flies, dipteran insects.
*  The aim was to sort of learn general principles of network evolution.
*  And I was using dynamical systems theory for my work.
*  And I guess it's I've always been a bit of a philosopher.
*  So I was reading philosophy as a high school student.
*  I was interested in the philosophy of science while I was a student.
*  And I read beyond the classes that I took about the philosophy of science.
*  But it was at that time when I was a sort of a PhD student still really that I noticed
*  that we had a really hard time publishing our work at the time.
*  The field was very hostile to the sort of modeling studies.
*  And I often realized that the reviewers didn't sort of criticize the methods that we were
*  using, but they didn't get the questions that we were asking.
*  And so I took this step back and I was wondering about what kind of questions do scientists
*  ask? And this set me on a trajectory that got me into becoming the director of a small
*  institute for the philosophy of science, which is called the Conrad Lorenz Institute for
*  Evolution and Cognition Science just outside Vienna a few years back.
*  I didn't stay there for very long for various reasons, but since then, I've continued on
*  this philosophical trajectory.
*  And during my time at that institute, I could make some really fantastic connections.
*  Scientists don't usually get in touch with philosophers of science, but I had all these
*  people that I was working with.
*  And there are some really good people out there that know a lot about not just the science
*  that we're doing, but also how we do it.
*  And it's a pleasure to be working with several of them now in collaboration.
*  So my work has taken a philosophical turn, but I'm still doing biology.
*  I would call it philosophical biology.
*  It's a type of theoretical biology that I would put famous people like Conrad Howell
*  Waddington into that has been on the back burner for the last 50 years or so.
*  And I think it's high time to revive it.
*  Can I ask? So you said that you were studying or reading philosophy in high school and
*  interested in it. And I did, too.
*  But I really didn't understand.
*  Looking back, I really didn't understand it.
*  I didn't have the same grasp on it that I believe I do now.
*  Of course, that's probably not true also.
*  But do you feel that same way?
*  Or did you get it back then?
*  No, absolutely not.
*  And you also read the kind of Nietzsche.
*  Yes, of course.
*  It's great.
*  Yeah.
*  Saratostra.
*  I still like that book.
*  But as you said, I mean, the context matters a lot.
*  And I am definitely reading very different things right now.
*  This was not a sort of a planned trajectory.
*  I meandered through a lot of this.
*  And as you explore, this is something I use in my work on academia as a system as well,
*  is that we have to have space to explore.
*  And a lot of it is serendipity.
*  When you give yourself the space and the time to explore, which is very important in my
*  own trajectory.
*  What would you say right now is the balance between your philosophical work output, let's
*  say, and empirical?
*  Because I know you're working on multiple philosophy manuscripts.
*  I've completely left empirical science.
*  My lab shut down in 2015.
*  I'm still carrying on some of the specialized work in evolutionary development and evolutionary
*  systems biology through our work on concepts of process homology, modularity, dynamical
*  modularity, and so on and so forth.
*  But I would say I've moved on, especially in my scientific work, what I call philosophical
*  biology. I'm interested in the concept of agency and its role in evolution, which is
*  probably something we'll talk about today.
*  So I've taken a turn, an irreversible turn away from empirical science, I would say.
*  OK, so let's talk about, yeah, you mentioned agency and its role in evolution.
*  And that's kind of the focal point and end point of your course Beyond Networks.
*  One of the things that I found interesting that sort of lit me up was I just see this
*  parallel between what you're talking about in tying together genotypes and phenotypes
*  and how to understand evolution in the complex systems that we have and how development
*  plays a role in that process and using dynamical systems to model that.
*  I just see this massive parallel with what's going on in modern neuroscience as well.
*  So that's why I thought immediately, oh, I've got to have you on because I wanted to
*  explore this. And I haven't thought deeply about making super close ties and exploring
*  what it means for neuroscience.
*  But this is something that I want to pursue further.
*  So I don't know if you so I don't know how familiar you are with the modern landscape
*  of neuroscience or at least one one facet of it that we talk a lot about on the podcast.
*  But maybe maybe what you could do is just give a really broad overview of this of the
*  course and and then we can go from there in two or three sentences.
*  Right. In two or three sentences, of course.
*  By the way, I should say this thing is 12.
*  It's like 48, you know, 30 to 40 minute videos.
*  So it's and it's super rich with historical perspectives, quotes, philosophical
*  perspectives and the modern science of evolution and genetics.
*  So, yeah, take it away.
*  So here's the executive summary of this.
*  I was aware I'm superficially aware of what's going on in neuroscience through
*  colleagues that are engaged and work there.
*  And I am, of course, aware that a lot of the arguments I'm making in my lecture apply
*  as well. It's not that I've published in the field.
*  But the central point, I guess, is that I was interested in the limits of
*  limitations of dynamical systems modeling, because I was always claiming that I am a
*  process thinker, that, you know, everything explanations have to be more focused on
*  processes and biology. And this has become really important in the field of genetics,
*  genomics, but also neuroscience because of this increasing pervasiveness of networks
*  that you see everywhere and they pop up everywhere.
*  And often they're just, you know, you have some sort of, you know, hairball graft, they're
*  called in systems biology with lots of nodes and connections.
*  And it's they're put in front on a slide and, you know, they're presented as an
*  explanation of what's going on.
*  While they don't really explain anything, right, that was one of my problems.
*  They just show that the system is complicated, basically.
*  I wouldn't even call it complex.
*  And so I became frustrated with this and that brought me into contact with people very
*  early on through my master supervisor, Brian Goodwin, and then my PhD supervisor, John
*  Reines was pioneering this approach of using dynamical systems model with data to
*  describe the actual dynamics, function and evolution of gene regulatory networks.
*  And this combination of empirical and theoretical work really appealed to me.
*  It was really new. This was before systems biology was called systems biology.
*  People called it functional genomics, what we were doing at the time.
*  And I claimed I went around and said, we're really looking at this in terms of process.
*  But I soon became aware that the methods we were using are also still very much rooted in this
*  network view of living organisms.
*  And if you if you look at living organisms, what they do is they change their structure
*  constantly. So we capture a specific structure in a dynamical system model.
*  And from that point of view, it's still static, right?
*  You have the equations that describe the interactions and those interactions are fixed.
*  So I became interested in I went back to work I did during my master's thesis,
*  where I got in touch with the work by Maturana and Varela and read a lot of Varela.
*  I did a master's in holistic science in the southwest of England in a little hippie college
*  called Schumacher College and read a lot of Varela and got in touch with embodied cognition
*  and activism. And so it's a funny twist. I basically took those ideas that came from
*  from neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience into the field of
*  genetics. So it's come full circle.
*  And through that, I became aware and through my employment in this philosophy of science institute,
*  the KLI, I got to know Alvaro Moreno and Matteo Masio who are doing work on agency and
*  organizational accounts of organisms and their theory is very much rooted in Varela's work.
*  And shows that the essence of biological organization is in the constantly change
*  in structure of the organism. It's the self making autoprietic aspect is that
*  it never stays the same. It's like the Red Queen and Alice, which which has to run to stay the
*  same. It changes all the time. And so there is this old argument going back to theoretical
*  biologist Robert Rosen that you cannot actually model this sort of organization.
*  And it's very controversial. And I became interested in these sort of questions.
*  Because if you're really a process thinker, and I think that's really important here,
*  you need to get let go of those those fixed structures. I mean, we can only study small
*  aspects of development and evolution using dynamical systems theory, but we cannot capture
*  the agency of the organism. And therefore, I think that's crucial for neurobiology. If you
*  come back to that, it's you need a dynamic approach, basically, but a dynamic approach
*  that is radically dynamic, not like dynamical systems, right?
*  Well, I mean, you know, as I was saying, I see the parallels between how you've used dynamical
*  systems theory within this limited approach to, you know, model the developmental process, etc.
*  And so in neuroscience, dynamical systems theory is all the rage right now to take a whole population
*  of neurons and figure out what they are doing through their like a trajectory through these
*  lower dimensional spaces and map that on to eventually to behavior. So that was kind of the
*  parallel that I saw. I wonder if I should, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to interrupt
*  our conversation because since we've talked about dynamical systems theory, so I'm going to play
*  you a question from a guest before we move on. So I had Kevin Mitchell on, we didn't talk too much
*  about his book, innate, but in the book innate, it's all about how development has had, you know,
*  gotten the short shrift in the story of our genotypes and how that leads to our behaviors,
*  our phenotypes and our behaviors. Anyway, so I thought he would be a good person to ask to
*  come on and ask you a question. So I'm going to play his question for you and then we'll continue
*  our conversation. Hi, Yogi, Kevin Mitchell here. I'm a big fan of the holistic non-reductive
*  approach that you and your colleagues bring to biological questions, which feels very rooted
*  in principles of process philosophy and system thinking that were popular for a while at various
*  stages in the 20th century, but which were then replaced with a very mechanistic and
*  reductionistic outlook. It feels to me like holistic dynamic approaches are gaining traction
*  again, probably because we now have experimental and computational tools to generate and deal with
*  dynamical data sets. And I wonder if you feel the same way in the reception your own work is getting.
*  Yes, thank you, Kevin. Yes, I do feel that way. And as I just said before, dynamic, even going
*  beyond dynamical systems, beyond fixed structures, this is extremely important. And I think there is
*  a big revolution coming at some point. It's a little frustrating to see how slowly it's catching on.
*  A lot of the empiricists have problems seeing the practical use of these things because
*  they're, you know, these ideas are still very theoretical and a big challenge is to bring them
*  to the bench basically. And that's, you know, even though I work theoretically now, exclusively,
*  that's one of my big aims is to work towards getting those theories in the range of empirical
*  tractability. I think that's extremely crucial. Now, I think Kevin is a very optimistic person,
*  and I like that. And also, it's nice to see that this work is seen among those people that really
*  matter. But I wouldn't say it's gotten a lot of traction in the mainstream of genetics or
*  of genetics or developmental genetics. And it's a bit sad to see how theoretical work is
*  massively undervalued in those fields. I think one of the reasons is that technological progress
*  has been so fast and the temptation to just produce data sets and resources has been
*  overwhelming to a lot of people. So we've forgotten a little bit about what I earlier called
*  philosophical biology. And I think it's very important to get back to those conceptual questions
*  now. And I've been trying to get people to sort of notice and get interested in it,
*  but it's really hard. I think it's also has a social dimension and everybody's under a lot
*  of pressure to just produce stuff. And these sort of questions are not very conducive to, you know,
*  career, basically, in today's academic system, I have to say.
*  Well, thanks, Kevin, for the question. So sorry to interrupt us, because I wanted you to continue
*  talking about the big ideas from the course. Before you do that, though, I am going to interrupt
*  us again, because a big thing that you talk about is process-based philosophy, a process
*  metaphysics, a process approach. And I love process metaphysics. I still find substance
*  metaphysics, the idea of things is so ingrained and so trained into me that I still have a whole
*  lot of trouble thinking of things in processes. And I'm wondering if that gets easier if you think
*  of everything in processes, or if you still struggle and think of things as think of processes
*  as things, right? So yes, that's a very good question. I mean, you don't, right? I mean,
*  so basically, there's a beautiful work by Johnson and Laker, for example, that look at the metaphors
*  we live by is the book, where they describe something that they call the containment doctrine,
*  which they can show that very early in your childhood, you form this vision of the world,
*  this is, you know, basically, I call it the Tupperware model of reality, it's basically
*  boxes within boxes, containers within containers. And so that's very, very deeply ingrained.
*  And what is important here is to say that for a lot of questions and topics, you don't need
*  a process-based explanations, a process-based approach, because it is very hard. There's,
*  you know, I think Quine was the first philosopher who brought up the absurdity of it all. He said,
*  you know, you'd have to sort of change language, for example, right? Subject, object, sort of,
*  he used the sentence, cat is the white cat is bristling towards the dog. It's catting widely,
*  bristling dog-worthy, you know, and so that's taking it at absurd. And also, Borges has a
*  beautiful argument about this in his short story, Glenn Orbestercius, it's called, it's a beautiful
*  story. And so you don't have to get rid of your language of thinking, but you have to realize
*  that sometimes, this very deeply ingrained pattern of thinking is hiding aspects of phenomena,
*  of questions, you know, it's preventing you to ask questions that just don't occur to you if you think
*  like this. For me, in genetics, it's very strong because you have this idea that you can explain
*  processes, developmental processes, behavior in terms of genes, which are things.
*  Genes are things, yeah.
*  Yeah, so they're like pearls on a string, right? And so you have a huge gap between, you know,
*  how is that thing causing any sort of behavior or phenotype? And that's been neglected for a long
*  time because we are happy with saying, you know, this gene does that, what does that even mean,
*  right? And these are quite obvious questions that are also beautifully treated in Kevin's work,
*  I have to say, that have often been so obviously in our face that we didn't see them anymore
*  sometimes. And there's a beautiful Whitehead quote from philosopher Whitehead, where he says that
*  often it's exactly those things that are so obvious, obviously not right, that we don't
*  even see them anymore. And these are the things that you have to, that's actually,
*  I used to work thing all the time.
*  It's terrible. So yeah, so it's exactly those aspects of reality that nobody's questioning.
*  If you question one of those and really find something, then that's how really big,
*  deep insights occur, of course, and changes in how we perceive the world. And I think that's very
*  true. So this is one of the challenges here is to see where and when do you use process-oriented
*  thinking process based explanations. And when is it okay? It's okay in many aspects and many areas
*  of life and science to use substance based explanations. That's fine.
*  In science, we're very concerned with definitions, right? So what's the definition of a gene?
*  So on the podcast, we talk a lot about intelligence and natural and artificial intelligence.
*  I feel like when you name something like intelligence, it reifies it and all of a
*  sudden it seems like a thing. And we'll get into this later about what kind of thinking,
*  process thinking or otherwise to apply to these sorts of things. But I feel like the entire
*  world of intelligence, natural, artificial, whatever those words, whatever intelligence means,
*  is really would benefit from a process based approach.
*  Absolutely. I mean, the one thing that got reified and has a really negative impact is
*  information. I mean, these sort of absurd claims that information is just as fundamental as
*  substance or whatever. It's a way of looking at the problem, right? If you use an information
*  based approach, you have a certain way of looking at a problem, but it's not like that the universe,
*  people, some people say the universe is made of information. What does that mean? It's just
*  completely meaningless. And so, yes, I agree with you, we have to think about what do these
*  terms mean? And what kind of work? I mean, one of the really important practical aspects of doing
*  philosophical work in science is to check concepts and to examine what is the work they do. And a lot
*  of the concepts we're using don't do any real work at the moment. So I think that's one of
*  the reasons we have to rethink. That's what I tried to do in the lecture to question a lot of those
*  concepts that we use every day. Or actually, a lot of them are just metaphors. They're
*  not defined beyond the genetic program and so on and so forth. These are metaphors that we use very
*  carelessly without realizing that they're metaphors anymore.
*  All right. Well, I really derailed us. But let's get back to agency and the idea of
*  closure. And well, I'll let you continue about how you think of agency and its role in evolution.
*  So this is actually stuff that came out of making this lecture. The lecture itself has been a process.
*  I've been giving this lecture for years at the University of Vienna to about 15 students before
*  COVID actually forced me to record it. And then I thought, why not put it up on YouTube? So that's
*  what I did. And now it's been viewed by hundreds of people, which is fantastic. Thank you all who
*  have taken the time to do that. So in the lecture, I sort of came to agency very late, just like in
*  my career. And now I'm sort of really interested in the role it plays in evolution. So here's
*  the big historical movement from Darwin. Darwin's theory of evolution was a theory of
*  struggle for survival of the individual of the organism, it was an organism based theory.
*  It had its had very big difficulties, right? It had no mechanism for inheritance, which is what
*  kept Darwin busy. And it had no mechanism for the production of phenotypes either. So this
*  theory was then completely transformed in the 20s and the 30s through the modern synthesis and
*  the rise of population genetics, which bracketed the organism. So it looked below the organism at
*  the genes and it looked above the organism at the population level. And it completely forgot
*  about the organism, the organism just became this sort of interface where population level and
*  genetic level interact, it had no importance. And of course, even Darwin knew that the behavior of
*  organisms actions, choices that organisms make have really important consequences for evolution.
*  But it's become a really big taboo topic, not just because we, you know, the term mechanism,
*  mechanistic explanation is often mistaken nowadays as meaning you have to explain something at the
*  level of molecules, the molecular gene. And I think that's, that's just crazy. I mean,
*  we're dealing in the life and neuroscience is that hierarchical multi level systems that need to be
*  explained at multiple levels. So then there's no scientific reason to focus on only one level,
*  that's just a sort of historical thing that happened, right? So I think I'm interested in
*  these higher levels. And I was thinking, what, what does organization, what role does organization
*  play in evolution? And you need this sort of weird biological organization. So let me, I probably
*  have to talk a little bit about this. So please do this specific notion of closure, organizational
*  closure is an idea that you have to basically account, it goes back to camp, that's a very old
*  idea. It was explicitly formulated by the developmental psychologist, Bia G. And the idea
*  is that you account for all the causally important factors from within the system, basically,
*  everything that you need to continue is has to be produced from within the system. Now,
*  it's very important to make a distinction between that sort of closure and thermodynamic closed
*  system, right? So systems with organizational closure have to be thermodynamically open,
*  they have to have a constant flow of matter, food, and energy through the system, otherwise,
*  they cannot achieve this organizational closure. And what it ultimately amounts to is that you have
*  a life cycle, right? So you have your at the end of the life cycle, you have produced something
*  that looks a little bit like you. And that is one of the fundamental principles of evolution,
*  you need a principle, not just a variation, but you need the right kind of variation.
*  And you have to pay a lot of attention to that. If you want to be truly evolvable. A lot of people
*  have pointed out that very simplistic concepts of evolution, like replicators, you know,
*  reductionist accounts that were pioneered by really smart people like John Maynard Smith,
*  and then others like Richard Dawkins, that you can have a naked replicator that just makes
*  copies of itself. It was pointed out really early on in the 70s, actually,
*  by Eigen and Schuster, that you get something that is called an error catastrophe. So if you
*  have a molecule that replicates itself, you get errors, and the errors are just linearly accumulating.
*  And at some point, if you have exponential, an exponential copying mechanism, you just get errors,
*  I mean, there's no way to maintain a species that could be selected for like that. At the other end,
*  you have self organizations to recalibrate work that is about auto catalytic systems,
*  for example, as a self organizing systems that maintain themselves in a certain state,
*  but they can't vary either. Right? Because as soon as they vary, they're no longer auto catalytic.
*  So they no longer produce themselves by definition. And so you have no variation
*  that you can select. And so this is a really tricky problem. And so I realized thinking about
*  this, that you really need the sort of lifecycle that organisms have. And that lifecycle depends
*  on organizational closure, this specific sort of snake that bites its tail organization of
*  living beings. This is a very superficial description of a very complicated theory here.
*  Now, what you also get with closure is agency. Okay, so what you have to imagine is that if you
*  look at it from a dynamical process oriented point of view, your current state as an organism
*  depends on past states of the environment, you react to your environment, but also on your past
*  states and those of your ancestors. So partially, at least your current state can only be accounted
*  for through previous states that you had internally. So a lot of it depends on causes that come from
*  within. And that's exactly what it means to act to have agency, right? So true, true concept of
*  agency, and I'm not talking about people who want to explain it away by saying it's nothing but
*  information processing, just input output processing. It is not like that. It is something
*  that this, you know, you have agency when some of your actions are caused from within your own
*  system. And that can only happen if you have organizational closure. So if you have that closure,
*  you have a certain basic agency, which is so I'm not talking about making decisions,
*  conscious decisions and all that a bacterium has this type of basic agency. So the bacterium can,
*  in a way decide to swim up the gradient by triggering certain behaviors in a very
*  stochastic way. And it has a very limited repertoire of actions, but still it makes,
*  we don't even have the language to talk about this. It's very dangerous to say it makes decisions.
*  It's not thinking about it. But it's internally generated. And it has a selection of different
*  behaviors that it can, you know, it could do otherwise, basically. Right. And it can only
*  do that because it has closure. So basically, what we've connected here is a principle of
*  systems that are evolvable, have to have this closed lifecycle, but these systems have to have
*  this particular type of organization, which automatically comes with agency, a certain
*  kind of autonomy from the environment. And so basically, agency and evolvability go hand in
*  hand. So the claim in my most recent work is that you cannot even get evolvable systems that are not
*  natural agents. And so then it becomes really important to ask what does that degree of freedom
*  entail for evolutionary theory? I mean, it has a really big consequences. Think about
*  niche building, like humans altering the environment instead of altering themselves.
*  So we adapt through changing our environment completely, more or less nowadays, this may not
*  work out very well in the end. But so all these sort of additional dimensions are completely
*  excluded if you look at just the genetic level. And that's something that a lot of critics of
*  reductionist evolutionary theory are saying, but here we have a specific perspective that I
*  call an agential perspective. So it's not just a process perspective, but it's a specific type
*  of process perspective on evolution, which allows us to ask different questions to make
*  these questions also legitimate to ask because there's a big taboo about asking, you know,
*  what does what the organism wants? What kind of role does that play in evolution? You know,
*  you're immediately dismissed as some sort of mystical teleologist, but that's not the point.
*  That's exactly not the point, right? It's taking the phenomena serious and trying to come up with
*  a scientific explanation. But this explanation may not be mechanistic, for reasons that I explain
*  in the lecture series again, because these sort of behaviors are not necessarily explainable in
*  mechanistic terms. So it's not unscientific. I repeat that it's not mysterious or anything,
*  but it's not what we consider a traditional mechanistic explanation, which is just taking
*  the system from state A through some causal chain to state B, okay, because it has this sort
*  of snake bites its own tail causal structure, which is very convoluted. It's not obvious how
*  to deal with it in mechanistic terms, basically. But in your lecture series, you talk a lot about
*  complex systems and how difficult they are to understand. And that's why a multi-perspectival
*  approach is beneficial. One of the things you talk about is near decomposability from Herbert
*  Simon, right? And where everything is connected and everything is affecting each other, but some
*  things are way more important and some things are less important. And I'm wondering if you had to
*  speculate this agential perspective in evolution, how important will it end up being to the process
*  of evolution or as among the multiple explanations of evolution? Will the agential perspective be
*  just a tiny thing? Will it become the main driver of explanations for evolution?
*  I have no idea. So the thing is, we haven't asked, we haven't looked, right? This is my problem.
*  I'm not, so here, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying, look, this agency is crucial for evolution.
*  I'm just saying I can make an argument that systems that are evolvable have agency.
*  That's the coincide. So if you have an agent, it's evolvable. If it's evolvable, it's an agent.
*  So it's worth looking at that. And this has not been looked at. These questions have not been asked.
*  So we don't know the answer. It may well turn out that it's completely unimportant. But I'm saying,
*  you can't just say that. A lot of reductionist geneticists just say, I know it's not important.
*  Macro evolution is just an extrapolation of population level, allele frequency shifts,
*  and that's just made up. There is no argument, scientific argument behind that. That's just a
*  simple extrapolation, linear extrapolation, and nobody ever has done any serious work on this.
*  So that's what I'm saying. It would be worth exploring. In the end, it may as well, you know,
*  near decomposability is nicely illustrated by astrology, right? I mean, astrologists have a
*  point when they say the planets do influence your relationship. Not sure. But I mean, you know,
*  the people who you have the relationship with, they're probably much more important
*  for your relationship than the- What's your sign, Yogi?
*  Oh, what is it? Pisces. Yes. I knew it. I could tell. I could tell.
*  Yeah. Yeah. No. So, you know, everything is connected to everything. But a lot of this stuff
*  is really these interactions are really not important for, you know, whatever question you
*  have. This is the basic principle of perspectival realism is that you're going at reality with a
*  certain angle and you have a certain question. And in that context, some perspectives are better
*  than others. So perspectivism is not relativism. Like, you know, some postmodern thinkers say
*  everything is just a discourse. All kinds of knowledge are the same. It- perspectivism is not
*  that. It says that for certain contexts, certain perspectives are better than others. They yield
*  more sound or robust trustworthy knowledge, but you cannot extrapolate that across all circumstances
*  ever, you know? And that's basically my favorite definition of a complex system is a system that
*  will show ever new properties in new contexts, right? So you basically can never list all the
*  possible properties of a complex system in advance. That's an argument that Stuart Kaufman
*  is strongly making. And so you get true radical emergence in evolution, true innovation, and it's
*  fundamentally unpredictable, which I think is a great thing. It's- I would really not like to live
*  in a clockwork sort of Laplacian demon universe where everything is determined. And so this is a
*  beautiful view of the process oriented, open-ended view of the world that is again going back to
*  Alfred North Whitehead and what he called theory of organism, which was a view of the metaphysical
*  system that viewed the world, the universe as more like an evolving process, an evolving organism
*  than a mechanism. I think that's- there's nothing dodgy or mysterious or unscientific about that.
*  We can have a science that's compatible with that and it would be much better to study evolution
*  using that sort of science than the traditional mechanistic approach.
*  You argue also that this agential perspective is in line with this open-endedness, what you're
*  calling radical emergence, through its interactions with the environment because it changes the
*  environment and that environment changes the agent and that- and there's this interaction
*  where the adjacent possible that Stuart Kaufman preaches about is this dynamic,
*  ongoing, open-ended process. That's right, preaching is right. But he's got the point,
*  right? I mean, so- Yeah. I really like the argument that philosopher Bill Wimsatt is making.
*  He has a book that's called Re-engineering Philosophy for Limited Beings and in the first
*  chapter he's sort of taking- it's called The Myth of Laplacian Omniscience and basically he says
*  a lot of the theory of knowledge and science through the ages has been made for an unlimited
*  being. The Laplacian demon who knows everything about the universe and its future and its past
*  is God. It's not a being that's in- a limited being that's in the universe and any limited
*  intelligence needs a different kind of approach to epistemology, to the theory of knowledge and
*  he builds that perspectival approach out of this argument. I think this is very powerful and you
*  end up- a bit ironically you end up with a much more realistic theory of knowledge than if you
*  base it on sort of dreams of the final theory. It's a very Laplacian sort of thing to do.
*  Yeah. There's so many different ways we can go here. I'm just- I'm itching to bring up the
*  AI work that you're working on with Stuart but I want to ask because you talked about how a
*  bacterium is an agent and how we are agents but to be an agent you don't need any consciousness,
*  you don't need any awareness. Where do you see a role for brains and or minds if you do see a role
*  in this agential open-ended evolution perspective?
*  So I see the zone between agency, basic agency and cognition, cognitive agency as a sort of a
*  gradient. I think nervous systems evolved on this sort of foundation of basic agency. One reason for
*  it is to enrich the repertoire of actions that you can select from. Of course, you have- if
*  you're mobile and you have a nervous system you have a lot more choices than if you're a bacterium
*  or a plant and that created its own sort of dynamic of evolution in that sense. So I think-
*  and this is why it's so important to build a vocabulary for agency without consciousness because
*  the problem is if we model the two then we get to panpsychism and stuff like that. Let's just
*  say that I'm not sympathetic to panpsychism. Okay, very good. Leave it at that. That's all I have
*  to say about that. So I think that's precisely an example of where we mistake- we're used to think
*  about phenomena that come out of agency in the context of consciousness because that's how we
*  work. It's really hard to abstract this away to organisms that don't have consciousness or
*  cognition. There's a field called bacterial cognition and I think it's bizarre.
*  Misnomer, perhaps?
*  I don't think it's- yeah. I think it's- if anything then it's not helpful. It's
*  really not helping because it models discussions that we have to have about
*  consciousness, about free will. These are really hard. I don't know what consciousness is. I don't
*  have a particular opinion about that.
*  It's a thing, of course.
*  Of course it's a thing. I would like to understand basic agency before we move on to
*  consciousness and there I'm very careful. Just that's a personal choice because I think
*  the questions that we ask about consciousness are not necessarily about the human being.
*  The questions that we ask about consciousness are not really well posed and I think we are now at a
*  stage in history, a time in history where we can start to ask well posed questions about agency.
*  But we lack the vocabulary. All the vocabulary we have about making decisions, selecting
*  behaviors, all of that is based on what we do as conscious beings, of course. It models the
*  waters. It makes it sound more hokey pokey than it is and often you confuse people because you
*  seem to be making the claim that everything has consciousness which I definitely don't agree with.
*  Let's talk about AI then because- so you and Stuart Kaufman are co-writing this manuscript
*  where you sound the alarms about how artificial intelligence is going to take over the world and
*  kill us all. Is that right? Do I have that right?
*  More or less. We're discussing at the moment and also I want to mention Andrea Roli, an AI researcher
*  from Italy who's involved in our conversations. It's a three-way conversation and we'd like to
*  have this discussion in a publication, of course. Here's the thing about
*  organizational closure. This weird organization gives you agencies. Basically, you could
*  formulate it in different terms. It allows you to want things. Again, we don't have the right
*  word. Bacterium doesn't want things in a conscious way. We want things but it still goes for the food.
*  It's a truly goal-oriented behavior and the argument is basically simply to say that
*  you cannot make an algorithm want things. In AI, this translates to the question about
*  the cost function choice to begin with or even to choose or not whether you want to optimize
*  the cost function or not. The argument is that in AI, first of all, all agents, as an AI
*  researcher would call them, are simply algorithms, input-output processing procedures.
*  And the argument of the organizational account of organisms is that organisms are exactly
*  not like that. They are more than that. So because they can cause actions from within the system,
*  they have a degree of freedom. Somebody, I forgot the name of the authors of the paper, called it
*  a freedom from immediacy. Organisms don't have to respond to the environment from a circle.
*  Golden Shadlin, I believe.
*  Richard Levy Oh, yes. That's right. You're right.
*  So freedom from immediacy, you don't have to. It's basically an argument about you could have
*  done otherwise. Again, it's not the argument about free will. Free will is something more
*  evolved and involves consciousness. Could the bacterium have behaved in a different way?
*  The answer, if you believe in what I would call a strong concept of agency is yes.
*  There is a degree of freedom. And so I think that's very important. Now the argument that
*  we're trying to make is that this degree of freedom is not algorithmic because it is not
*  formalizable 100%. And there are several arguments that have been made in the past about this. One
*  of them by Robert Rosen, the first one, who is often misunderstood as saying that you cannot
*  model an organism. And it's been conclusively shown that you can make a simulation of an
*  organism that behaves like an organism. You have to use recursive functional programming paradigms
*  to do this. It's complicated. You can't just do traditional dynamical systems theory, but you can
*  do it. But Rosen's argument wasn't about that. He said it's not formalizable completely. So it's
*  an incompleteness argument analogous to GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem in math.
*  Now GÃ¶del's showing that number theory is incomplete doesn't mean you can't use number
*  theory. It just means that it doesn't capture all possible statements about numbers. And this is the
*  same argument. So basically, you can make a model of the organism, but the organism can always
*  surprise you because it has this degree of freedom to act in a way that it's never done before
*  because its action right now, its state right now depends on its entire history, evolutionary
*  history in the end. And so its behavior is fundamentally unpredictable unless you know
*  this entire history, which is impossible. So that's one argument. The other argument
*  that Stuart Kaufman presents is complementary to that. And he says he cannot simply predict
*  all the possible functions of a complex system. So he takes a screwdriver as an example.
*  It's been designed to tighten bolts, but you can also use it for all kinds of other
*  purposes. You can pry a door open with it, you can pick your nose, I think the same as well.
*  Yeah, whatever. And exactly. And so the because the context of its use is always different than
*  ever evolving into the future. It's never the same. This is a radically context dependent property
*  function, the function of the screwdriver. And so as soon as a thing, a thing, you see,
*  an organism, a process has a function, you cannot predict all the possible functions
*  anymore. And so that brings you this sort of adjacent possible view of, you know, radical
*  innovation, radical emergence, but that you simply cannot predict a specific context before it
*  actually happens. There's another beautiful book that I recommend by process philosopher,
*  Nicholas Rescher, which is called unknowability, where he makes the same argument in the context
*  of discovery of science, where he says, if you could predict a specific discovery in the future,
*  then you would have already made it. So there's a logical paradox there. So specific discoveries
*  in the future are facts that are fundamentally unknowable. You just can't know them. Because if
*  you do, then you've already made it and then this is not a future discovery anymore. So I really like
*  this sort of view. So we're tying together these arguments to say, okay, so we cannot have this
*  sort of open endedness, this this sort of surprise element in the behavior and the evolution of
*  organisms in an algorithmic system. And since all our AI agents are algorithmic, they cannot
*  actually do that. So the argument is basically, maybe you can call it a strong and a weak sense
*  of agency, the weak sense of agencies is simply algorithmic information processing. And you can
*  make an argument that the what makes biological agents, true agents goes beyond that. And therefore,
*  you cannot have this sort of artificial general intelligence, think Skynet, that suddenly wants
*  to exterminate humanity, it's not going to do that. Why would it want to exterminate humanity?
*  And how do you program it? It will always be limited in some way by the way in which you've
*  set up the AI system in the first place, while living systems are not. They are also constrained,
*  but they can break through those constraints eventually, through evolution, while an AI
*  simply can't do that. Because it's algorithmic.
*  What if you create like someone like Ken Stanley, and lots of people working on evolvable systems?
*  So these systems are always evolvable in a limited way. I mean, this has also I mean,
*  the failure of artificial life, you know, that the sort of is this why why do these evolutionary
*  simulations always get stuck? It's my strong suspicion that it is because these agents,
*  again, that's a bit of a misnomer, I always scare quote, the term in this context,
*  are not true agents. And so I heavily suspect, of course, I'm biased here, that it would be
*  interesting to look at the role of agency in evolution, because I don't think you can get
*  this sort of open ended evolution without agents. And this is what I talked about when I use the
*  term evolvability here, it's a very specific sense, a very strong sense of the term of
*  all the buildings of true innovations that are not just, you know, and dress Wagner is making
*  the argument that that evolution is just sampling from a huge platonic space of ideal forms, which
*  is bizarre. And I think Kaufman's argument is, is, is directly opposite this sort of view. And I
*  like it much better because it's process oriented, and we don't have this pre existing space of
*  possibilities, we cannot formulate it. Is there room for good enough,
*  AGI or good enough AI that we would be satisfied? I don't really even know what the goal of AGI is.
*  So you asked different people, and they have different answers. But, you know, will we be
*  satisfied that we've created something good enough using something like, you know, reinforcement
*  learning algorithms, right, where you you are, you know, you're still externally giving the
*  objective function as it's as it's as the agents scare quotes motivation, right? You know, a lot,
*  you know, a lot of people are talking about reinforcement learning being enough to get to
*  AGI. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, the question is, what do you want? As you say, it's not clear to me. I
*  mean, you can, you know, what is it Eliza passed the Turing test for a few minutes, you know, with
*  lots of people. So that's, so I think it depends on how you set the bar. And also, if you want,
*  I mean, often, we're happy with imitations. So AI can produce a lot of imitations of creativity and
*  true life. And we are very convinced by that, because it's very good at doing that. And so
*  the question again, is what, why would we want to do this? It's just, I think, for me, this discussion
*  is important. Because if you read around in rationalist circles, and all that a lot of them,
*  there's a beautiful book called the precipice, which is listing all the different existential
*  risks to humanity right now. And always near the top of the list is this generally AI sort of
*  replacing us. And what will kill us is Facebook, you know, watch the social dilemma, don't fret
*  about Skynet. It already is. Yes. So that's much more immediate and much more dangerous than Skynet.
*  Don't worry about Skynet. Skynet is not going to happen anytime soon. You may actually have to
*  evolve synthetic life to get that, you know, a sort of an AI implemented in a synthetic life
*  form to get that, you know, but now we're talking about science fiction. Well, right, well, right.
*  Yeah, I was gonna ask you about that. I mean, you know, so is life a necessary precursor to
*  intelligence? Or do we need to reconceptualize what we mean by the thing we call intelligence?
*  Do we, I don't even know what the hell we're talking about, to be honest.
*  Exactly. Yeah. It's very, I mean, there are arguments back and forth, whether you could
*  implement the, so the principles of organization of a living organism are not necessarily dependent
*  on the material substrate. But of course, the material substrate needs to have certain
*  characteristics. And the argument has been made by Alvaro Moreno and Arantia Eterreia, among other
*  people, that you need an organic substrate to get that. You can't implement that mechanically. It's
*  just not feasible. But I wouldn't venture too much out on that limb. You know, maybe we develop
*  some kind of, you know, grey goo technology soon that can do it. I don't know. What we're arguing
*  with Stuart and Andrea here is that you need a completely different architecture of your AI.
*  And at the moment, with our current technologies, I would say the only thing that can do it is a
*  living cell, a living organism. What do you think, if you had to, again, speculate,
*  how far into the future do we need to go until we can artificially create it with materials and
*  new architectures? So that depends on what you could call strong synthetic biology, right? I mean,
*  at the moment, what we're doing is we're doing, we're playing some electrical engineering equivalent
*  in organisms. And then we try to predict what the circuits that we build into the organisms do. And
*  then mostly we're wrong. So the true aim of such a synthetic biology would, of course, be to
*  synthesize a living organization from scratch. Because, you know, these kinds of sort of
*  publicity stunts that Venter, for example, did that saying, oh, you know, we've synthesized the
*  genome and then put it in a cell and it lived. They cheated in two ways. First of all, the genome
*  was based on existing genes from an evolved organism. And of course, the cell they transplanted into
*  was a living thing, you know, same thing again, I shouldn't, but a living organism. So that's not
*  creating life at all. So it would be to synthetically produce an organization with closure that shows
*  all kinds of signs of life and has agency in this strong sense that I was trying to convey
*  in my lecture and in my recent work. So I think that is something that current AI certainly cannot,
*  I mean, if we talk about what we're doing right now, this is impossible to do. But I don't want
*  to speculate. Whenever you say it's impossible to do something technologically, someone comes along
*  and does it. So whether we'll have in the near future such artificial organizations,
*  lifelike organizations is a very open question. It's a nice challenge for engineers and synthetic
*  biologists out there. It is a bit Frankensteinian, so it would have to be regulated quite a bit,
*  in my opinion. And we'd have to proceed with extreme caution also not to release this kind
*  of stuff into the environment. I know you're not a neuroscientist or an AI practitioner,
*  but a lot of the people I have on the podcast use deep learning networks, which is a large part of
*  current AI to study what's going on in brains and make a story about how the network and its
*  dynamics are similar to brain dynamics. Do you have thoughts on that kind of approach? Or do
*  you see it as fundamentally limited in the same way? So I see it as fundamentally limited. It's a
*  huge step forward to just sort of looking for certain circuits in the brain and say,
*  this circuit does this, this circuit does that. Because the circuit doesn't do anything. You can
*  run different processes on the same circuit and so on and so forth. So in that sense,
*  it's a huge step forward. And the other hand, it's again, it's just a very fixed, traditional
*  sort of dynamical systems approach that will not give you true autonomy of cognitive processes,
*  because it's just algorithmic. It's limited in that way. It'll allow you to simulate probably
*  a lot of the aspects of cognitive processes. So I have to say, and this is very important, that
*  a large part of an organism, a large part of our brain works in mechanistic ways. So we can get
*  a long way by studying these systems with dynamical systems approaches. So I think we
*  can definitely make pragmatic progress, even great progress with these sort of approaches,
*  but they will not in the end, give us a complete ever give us a complete picture of a deep
*  understanding of how brains work. Because they're intrinsically limited to mechanism to algorithm.
*  And for me, I mean, if we can show that even a simple bacterium, as agency that is not algorithmic,
*  then we don't have to discuss whether the brain is a Turing machine anymore. You know, some of the
*  processes that run in the brain may be like computation and Turing sense, but the whole
*  brain, the whole organism is why should it be captured by this limited technological metaphor
*  that we're using here, right? I mean, it makes no sense. We have to prove that for something.
*  I think the burden of proof is simply from the people that claim that to be true. And they often
*  say it's evident, but it's not. I don't think it is at all. I've never seen a convincing argument
*  for it. I mean, there are people like Mark Bickert, who kind of rail against computationalism,
*  right? The computational approach to understanding, but you have to admit that it has been one hell of
*  a successful perspective on advancing our understanding of at least certain aspects,
*  those aspects that you're talking about that you can understand in mechanistic terms.
*  I have colleagues in evolutionary biology who go against molecular biology and molecular
*  reductionist approach is saying, we're against that. That's absurd. Okay. So this is a very
*  successful science and it's brought us a lot of really interesting and important insights.
*  And the trick is to realize its limitations, just like computationalism and cognitive science,
*  right? It's a very useful approach, but just like any perspective, if you're a perspectiveist,
*  you realize that this is just one perspective you can take and it's useful in certain contexts,
*  and it's not useful in others. And what's happening in both neuroscience and the life sciences is that
*  this sort of genetic paradigms, these metaphors like genetic program, all of that, and then
*  program metaphors also in the neurosciences have been taken massively out of context and used to
*  explain phenomena beyond their boundaries. So basically we've inverted the argument. If it
*  doesn't fit our paradigm, then it's not real. And this you see in the literature about agency
*  all over the place. So this sort of trying to explain it away rather than to explain it,
*  because then we can save mechanistic approach instead of saving the phenomena and taking them
*  serious. And I think that's just upside down. If you're a true empiricist, you're taking those
*  phenomena serious and you're not just dismissing them because they don't fit in your preconceived
*  paradigm of how you should do science. Right. So one of the things that Moreno and Malsio talk
*  about in their book on biological autonomy, so thinking about your perspective on the agent as
*  an autonomous organization with organizational closure, closure of constraints. They talk about
*  this also in their book, but they also sketch out an argument and admit that it's an incomplete
*  argument that they believe that our brains and minds have the same kind of organizational closure
*  autonomous from the rest of our organism. Right. So there are different China dolls or Russian
*  dolls of autonomy or something. Right. Do you buy this perspective or do you think that we need,
*  I mean, I know that there are multiple valid perspectives, but do you buy the organizational
*  closure of minds? I'm not sure. I think it's definitely not clearly distinct. It's a different
*  type of organization. They have a really nice argument I have to say in their book about what
*  is really basic closure. So metabolic closure, basically just keeping yourself alive, and then
*  regulatory layer on top of that, which allows you to adapt. So they call this adaptive agency and
*  say it's just one level above basic agency. Basic agency is just sort of having a metabolism that
*  maintains itself and maintains if you buy into the autopoiesis perspective, also the boundaries
*  of the organism. And then you have through those boundaries interactions with the environment,
*  and you get through regulation, you get an adaptive type of agency where the organism is able to react
*  to influences from the environment. And you can make a really convincing argument that in some ways,
*  these are different layers of complexity in a living system. So you could make a similar
*  by extrapolation, as far as I understand, they make the argument that through evolution,
*  nervous systems have autonomized themselves in this way. And I do buy that general argument
*  as plausible. Of course, it's just a scenario at this point. It's hard to actually prove that,
*  but it's a plausible scenario. But I wouldn't call it completely. So the danger is always to
*  near decompose ability means that we can distinguish different aspects of an organism
*  without having to separate them. And so this is very important and is often overlooked,
*  because you don't have to be able to separate processes to be able to distinguish them and
*  treat them in different ways. And again, prospectivism helps you understand that
*  as a very powerful way of understanding why that is.
*  One of the things that you repeatedly bring up in your course, and I have to admit,
*  I have not read Reengineering Philosophy for Limited Beings yet, but I have used the same images
*  inspired by, you know, just I just basically copied you from Bill Wimsat. And I'm specifically
*  thinking about the one where the causal structure at our level of organization in this world,
*  in the biopsychological thicket, you repeatedly point to this and say, you know, you wouldn't
*  expect to be able to have a purely reductionist explanation. And we need this is why perspective
*  perspectives are good, because each perspective is a cut through this causal biopsychological thicket.
*  That's a long winded introduction to my question, which is, do you see?
*  So what I've kind of been thinking about is like, how are the brain sciences, brain and mind sciences
*  in the same predicament as the biological life, evolution and genetic sciences? Or are there
*  important differences? Because I just see so many parallels between what's happening and what you
*  describe that's happening in your world. That predicament is definitely the same,
*  it gets increasingly worse. I mean, Wimsat makes some really nice arguments saying that,
*  um, well, if you have these perspectives, they have to cut the phenomena in, you know,
*  the thicket in ways that make sense. And as you get to ever more complex layers in the social
*  sciences, especially, but also cognitive science, you get to bigger and bigger challenges there.
*  Because, as I said, in our discussion about consciousness, we have a really big problem.
*  And that is nobody knows what we're talking about, really.
*  Uh oh, you're gonna get in trouble.
*  I know, I just said that on air. Yeah. Let the hate mail come. But I think that's
*  a problem. I mean, you can make some really, there are some really, don't get me wrong,
*  there's some really interesting arguments there. But I think it's really hard to cut that thicket
*  in the right way. And I'm saying, as we slowly cut our way through, agency only has become amenable
*  to these kinds of questions very recently. And it's even possible now to maybe have an empirical
*  study of how this organization of natural agents works. But this is also very dependent on the
*  technology we have to the kind of other knowledge we have very complex dependent itself, it's an
*  evolution of knowledge. And so I think we can we can cut our way through the thicket. But one of
*  the basic insights from arguments about incompleteness in this area is that you will
*  never have, you know, how was it count said you will never have a Newton of a blade of grass,
*  you will never have a general theory like in physics. And, of course, count was a big cop out
*  he said, Oh, you know, you should treat organisms as if there were mechanisms, but even if they're
*  not called this teleomechanism, and we still have that, for example, in the writing of Dan Bennett,
*  he has something called the intentional stance, like he says, Oh, organisms are mechanisms.
*  But it makes sense to treat them as if they were not because they behave as if they were not. And
*  then I'm wondering, what are we doing here? I mean, I mean, why don't we take this phenomenon
*  of agency serious, and maybe we learn something instead of just trying to explain it away that
*  way. And saying, Oh, we're just pretending here that something has agency, because it makes it
*  easier for us to think about it, which is an inconsequential, it's not consistent, as for me,
*  it doesn't work. It's sort of, it's a bit half assed, really, to be quite frank. So I think so
*  what I really like about Wimsad is really hard to read. But what I really like about Wimsad is that
*  he takes this idea of having to have different level explanations really serious and makes a
*  very convincing argument for that. So he has a chapter where he describes the uses of reductionism.
*  And again, he has this very sophisticated stance where he says reductionism is good for a lot of
*  things. And I just don't want to come across here saying, Okay, we shouldn't do this. I'm just saying
*  we have to recognize its limitations. And what we're doing right now is not that we're going
*  way beyond its limitations. And it causes all kinds of problems, for example, our arrogant attitude
*  towards nature as controllable and predictable is one is one very big societal consequences that
*  sort of failure to recognize our limitations in this sense. So this the mechanistic approach
*  is very limited. And it doesn't apply to most things that truly interest us. If you think about
*  it, a gentle systems are involved in all kinds of real, you know, the things that really truly
*  interest us and that are important for our survival ecosystems, the economy, social networks that are
*  disintegrating, and so on and so forth. So I think a science of a gentle system is just
*  absolutely fundamental. And we do not have it yet. I mean, complexity science as it is right now,
*  it's just dynamical systems, because it has this non notion of agency. It's just computation. And
*  that's just not working for us. Even dynamical systems is hard to intuit, right. So one of the
*  appeals of the mechanistic approach is because it's intuitively appealing, thinking about the
*  entities and their their parts and activities to explain the phenomenon at hand. And when you start
*  talking about bifurcations and dynamical landscapes and trajectories, all of a sudden it gets slippery.
*  And then so I don't know, is the agential perspective going to be even worse?
*  Yes, it's going to be a lot worse than that. Well, actually, yeah, you end your course,
*  it's aspirational. And you say, Oh, I'm going to have to go learn a lot more math now,
*  you know, because it's a real project. I think one of the interesting things is to
*  explore the limitations explicitly. So to push things till they break. And this has, for example,
*  not been done enough in terms of taking recursive functional programming to its limits. These are
*  programming approaches that allow you to operate not only on, you know, the state of the system or
*  the parameters, but on the on the very structure of the system, the operators and the system itself.
*  So you have basically a program that rewrites itself. And that's already a pretty good
*  approximation to what an organism is. But again, it remains algorithmic. So at some point, it'll
*  break and we'll get stuff that happens that is not captured by this formalism. The question is,
*  where does that happen? And again, does it happen often enough for it to be relevant, important for
*  our understanding of evolution, other systems that involve agents, you know, cultural evolution,
*  the economy? I think it might intuition would be that this of course plays a huge role in social
*  systems, and probably a somewhat lesser role in evolution, but I still think it plays, it probably
*  plays a really important role. And as you say, I mean, it's comfortable to be used as modern people,
*  enlightened people that go into science. We think of anything that is not mechanistic is not scientific.
*  I mean, I want to come back to that point. And that's just not right. You know, I mean, there
*  is no reason. My friend, philosopher Dennis Walsh, he's making a really convincing argument that
*  certain types of teleological explanations are completely scientific and are okay, but only certain
*  types, for example, the teleological explanation that an organism acts in a certain way, because
*  it wants something. He has a very strong argument that this doesn't, you know, violate any of the
*  sort of claims against teleological explanation that you have causation from the future, etc,
*  etc. That's not a problem. But of course, other people trying to convince us that evolution has
*  an ultimate goal or something like that is completely illegitimate. So the line cannot simply
*  be drawn at mechanism and then say anything that's not a mechanistic explanation is not
*  scientific. That's taking a very narrow stance on what a scientific explanation is. And that's a
*  pretty recent thing, you know, going back at the most of the scientific revolution, because
*  Aristotelian views of the world were much richer in terms of what kind of quest answers to the
*  question why you can, you can provide and have to provide to understand something. And I think we've
*  lost something there, you know, and if we don't get past that limitation and recognize it in the
*  first place, that's, that's the thing. I mean, we don't we are so embedded in it, that we don't see
*  its limitations anymore. It's like, you know, does the fish have knowledge of the water around it,
*  you know, it's like, it's like the water we're swimming in. And we've completely forgotten about
*  that we've actually constructed this approach to the world pretty recently. And it was so successful
*  that we've just completely forgotten all the other stuff that we've thrown out
*  to make it work in the first place. And it's time to get back to that because a lot of the problems
*  we have right now are in understanding our situation in the world and in understanding
*  truly complex systems that have agents in them is has to do with these philosophical questions that
*  we've been discussing. And of course, neurosciences are completely included in that.
*  This cry for theory that there we have so much data, we don't know what to do with it. And we
*  need theory. This is prevalent in the neurosciences and the sciences of the mind. But watching your
*  course, and is it just a mirage due to your scholarship that you bring in so much biological
*  theory that it looks to be a golden age of theory in the biological sciences? Is that a mirage because
*  you highlight so many efforts? So here's again, the real world. It's a beautiful picture. I think
*  there's lots of good theory to be produced in neuroscience and life sciences at the moment.
*  The problem is that I think a lot of what again, the scientific system is set up that you have to
*  shout to the world, here I am, here I am. It's me, it's me, it's me all the time. And so people
*  produce a theory that is self serving at the moment. It's not targeted at a deeper understanding
*  of a phenomenon, but just at the self promotion. And I think our fields are flooded with this type
*  of theory, which gives theory again, a bad name. So we have this sort of self serving, I would call
*  it shallow theory, technical term used by philosopher Harry Frankfurt is bullshit.
*  And that is increasingly prevalent for the reason that you have to produce it to be seen and heard
*  at the moment. And I think that's a real problem. So we're sort of flooded by this. And this will
*  certainly be counterproductive. I'm gearing up to write a paper about the pernicious role of shallow
*  theory, which is for two reasons. First of all, it floods everything with bad theories, theory gets a
*  bad reputation. But the other thing is, it creates an illusion of understanding where there is none.
*  And I have to say that some aspects of the discussions about consciousness are of that
*  type, but also theory in evolutionary biology and are completely missing the target. And again,
*  as I said before, if you have concepts, you have to analyze them and see what kind of work they do.
*  And often we introduce new concepts and so called frameworks that do no work at the moment. And so
*  I think that's a real problem because it makes it really hard for people to recognize the important
*  questions. Again, Wimsat has beautiful arguments about this, how we really don't realize often
*  that we're talking past each other and are just shouting past each other. And he talks about these
*  pseudo debates that happen, especially in that thicket, causal thicket, where it's really hard
*  to see the forest for the trees. That's the nature of the game. It's hard to do biology,
*  it's hard to do neuroscience, it's definitely hard to do social sciences.
*  Lennon Well, it's hard to keep a career as well. And that's a motivator, I think.
*  Wimsat Right. So we cut through, we just raise the thicket completely,
*  burn it down. And that's not a good way to go about it.
*  Lennon Well, speaking of theory, you were about to start talking about something I definitely
*  wanted to talk about because one of the things that your course has done, and my other reading
*  as well, I don't want to give you all the credit, of course, but is the idea that synthesis is not
*  the goal. So growing up scientifically, synthesis is always the goal, you need to synthesize.
*  And that's how you understand, that's how you explain things. But one of the things that a
*  perspectival approach leaves room for is that synthesis is not necessarily the end goal. And
*  in the course, you talk about the modern synthesis and the extended evolutionary synthesis,
*  and these attempts to, quote unquote, synthesize and come up with a grand unified theory of
*  evolution. And there are a lot of people talking about grand unified theories and neuroscience and
*  the brain, etc. And there's a lot of plenty of pushback to and I, you know, you would be among
*  those pushing back on the idea of needing a grand unified theory in this causal thicket. So I just
*  wanted to cue you and ask you, why is synthesis so bad, Yogi?
*  Yogi So here you have this process evolution
*  that creates its only function, I would say it's the dangerous word is to create diversity. And
*  we have some unifying principles like natural selection, although we know even population
*  geneticists know very well that a lot of evolutionary process don't involve natural selection, but you
*  have this sort of principle, but think about the complementary aspect of evolution, the processes
*  that create new phenotypes, sometimes entirely new levels of organization, and these are called
*  nature transitions of evolution, eukaryotic cells, and of course, the evolution of consciousness in
*  the end, we always end up there. Can be seen as something like that, a new level of organization,
*  a new degree of freedom, as we said before, I think that makes a lot of sense. So you wonder
*  can you have a general account of those processes that create what is actually being selected? And
*  I don't think you can because they are of this of this nature that is constantly reinventing
*  remaking itself. So they whenever you have, you think you have the final theory, it will surprise
*  you again. So for that reason, it's bizarre. So the modern synthesis that has been argued very
*  convincingly by different people, my friend and colleague Arlen Stoltzfus, among others, and Ron
*  Amundsen, philosopher of science, that the synthesis was really more of a restriction,
*  it was a form of scientific gatekeeping, which was very important at the time, to define a field
*  that was new at the time. And it excluded more that it synthesized, to be honest, because
*  all these aspects, these constructive aspects were excluded. And this movement, the extended synthesis
*  is rightly claiming so they're going in the right direction there, that they're claiming back these
*  these sort of neglected aspects of these constructive aspects of evolution, as evolutionary
*  biology, that the mistake is, or you know, where there's just not, it's just a slogan, really,
*  is the synthesis part, because there is no synthesis, that the striking thing about this
*  extended synthesis is it's just a bunch of disconnected phenomena that niche construction,
*  phenotypic plasticity are thrown together, you see these diagrams and slides where these concepts are
*  somehow, you know, put in circles around each other, but that makes no sense. It's just a bunch
*  of things, right, that are partially already part of traditional evolutionary theory. If you go back
*  to Darwin, niche construction was in Darwin's books, he knew that earthworms make earth,
*  that is their habitat, he has an illustration on that in a book. And so it's like, and then it's
*  sort of vague, right? I mean, sort of it's throwing around concepts. But if you do theory,
*  the theory needs to do work, you know. So I'm not saying there are lots of excellent people in this
*  movement that do excellent empirical and theoretical work on their specific problems that they're
*  working on, I'm saying the framework, and this general idea of that there is a well definable
*  modern synthesis that needs to be extended is, well, can I call it bullshit? And I think it's
*  just a tool, a political tool, gatekeeping tool, a tribal tool, and people are having this is a
*  fierce debate between if you're between those camps, if you're neither on the anti ES side or
*  on the pro ES side, you feel it, I can tell you, especially if you're a young, untenured researcher,
*  and it's a pseudo debate that brings the field nowhere. And that's, I've been sitting
*  in that crack between those two for a while now. And it's not pleasant, but it's very important
*  work to do to say, look, I mean, this is a, you know, a soccer game where I want both teams to lose,
*  you know. So it's like, I don't think this is a productive debate, because I don't think that the
*  conceptual frameworks that are presented are anything else but tools for politics, academic
*  politics, not theoretical tools for insight. And I think we need to talk about this, but it's very
*  difficult because you immediately get shouted at. And that's not a healthy sort of way, you know,
*  I'm a big provocative in this, of course, and so I don't mind getting shouted at. But I think I do
*  think that we need a productive discussion where people try to understand the actual problems. And
*  I think the underlying problem is exactly that the synthetic approach is completely wrong in an area
*  where you're looking at a thicket, causal thicket, plus a thicket that is creating constant novelty
*  as the nature of the game, you just need a perspectival approach. And this has been
*  recognized by a few people, of course, I mean, again, Bill Wimstead is the go to for that. And
*  he actually did his PhD as a philosopher in the lab of Richard Lewington, very good evolutionary
*  biologist, who's often named as one of the core modern synthesis proponents, who is one of the
*  best thinkers about dialectics in evolution, and is often maligned because he was a Marxist. And so
*  you know, it's like, it's not like a serious communist. It's actually, it has dialectics in
*  it. But that's it. And that's not, you know, I'm not a communist, but I like his work. And
*  the people distance themselves often just because of that. And that's, I mean, these kind of
*  ideologies that intrude at the moment are a sign of a high pressure environment with little funding
*  and lots of infighting, more than they are of a productive theoretical discussion. That's basically
*  summing it up. And I think it's time to move beyond synthesis, because historian of science,
*  Betty Smokowitis has made a really convincing argument that this synthesis is a sort of a
*  positivist remnant. It's a remnant of an old philosophy of science that saw everything as
*  sort of the aim of science is producing large scale theories from which we reduce everything else.
*  And that's just not going to work in modern biology, because we're dealing with a cause of
*  effect. It's basically that and a novelty generating process, evolution, you know,
*  and cultural evolution, economy, that's the same. So these fields need a completely different
*  perspective approach, because we're dealing with truly complex systems.
*  Then in the last few moments here, I just want to ask you zoom out and ask you some kind of career
*  questions, if you'll indulge me. Absolutely one, I, you know, your path has been unique,
*  as everyone everyone says that their own trajectory is unique. But, you know, I look at yours and it
*  truly is. If you had to go back, if you thought back, would you do anything differently? Would
*  you tell yourself anything or try to convince your younger self to do anything differently?
*  Yes, I mean, the one thing I wouldn't do is sort of worry about things that are five years in the
*  future, because anything that I worried about five years in the future never happened. And
*  this is, I was always somewhere completely different than I had thought in those five years.
*  And so this is what would be advised to young scientists. The other thing is, if you go into
*  science right now, I think I've managed to do this to a certain degree, but not enough is really do
*  what you care about your passionate about. And I've often managed to do this, there were a few
*  occasions where I mean, there are sort of two things. One is I wouldn't work on certain topics
*  anymore, just because I think they these happened very early in my career, where I just thought,
*  Okay, this is going to be good for my career. And I wouldn't do that anymore. But I didn't do that.
*  I pretty early on decided not to do that. The second thing is don't work for people who have
*  the wrong attitudes towards doing science and are sort of bad instructors, mentors, and sometimes
*  just sort of have a hidden agenda or something or playing games, academic games. And that's becoming
*  more and more pervasive. This is this academic politics is a game that I've decided not to play.
*  And this is also why I'm out of academic traditional academic career path. I don't even want to get back
*  into that even if I wouldn't still get a job at an academic institution. That's my life's too short
*  for that. What if you could be the head of a department though? Even worse, wouldn't it?
*  Yes, no, no, no, no. I've been the head of an institute and as beautiful as that work was,
*  and it was very good. It was also for a limited amount of time. Fortunately, I have to say,
*  it wouldn't have been good for me long. I'm not I am an explorer. I want to do academic research.
*  And I've read this in the Times Higher Education supplement. There was this article that was
*  entitled, if you like research, academia may not be for you. Because it was a survey of Dutch
*  scientists and they said, on average, they spend 11% of their time on research. And so the article
*  basically said, if you do theoretical research, why not get a 50% job somewhere? So I'm trying to
*  get a business model to work where I teach courses, I do retreats about the academic system for young
*  scientists. And I'm trying to start something called meta modern mentoring for people about,
*  you know, the sort of dimension of learning that we often neglect today, which is personal growth
*  in various directions, that is never assessed in those metrics that we have, it's just factual
*  knowledge and your usefulness to fit in an economic system that is not right. So it's sort of,
*  I'm trying to earn money with that sort of activity on a freelance basis and then use the
*  rest of the time for research instead of going through that head of department. I mean, head of
*  department job has always worked under so many head of departments. And it's been a nightmare.
*  If I saw my future in that it was like, Oh my god, no, I don't want to do that.
*  No, thank you. Hopefully the heads of departments aren't listening right now.
*  I mean, I admire them and I pity them. And a lot of them do a really important and good job, but
*  I'm not cut out to do this. That's not a judgment. I'm not saying they're all bad or whatever.
*  It's just no, I don't want to do that. Don't worry. I'll edit out the admiration comment. So
*  my last question. So one of the reasons that I got out of academia is because one of the reasons is
*  that I felt like I was becoming more and more specialized and my skills were becoming deeper,
*  of course. And I was learning a lot more in that respect. But I was, you know, losing the
*  forest for the trees, for instance, there is important work that was just adjacent to what
*  I was doing that I wasn't even really aware of or didn't even appreciate because I was so focused
*  on what I was doing. And it seems like your path has been of the opposite direction where you
*  either have fought to maintain a broad picture and think about what's important or spent extra time
*  doing that or somehow magically, because I know you've done a lot of hard, deep work modeling
*  these systems that we've talked a little bit about today. But has that been,
*  can you paint that picture for me? Has that been a struggle because it's kind of
*  going against the grain, you know? Yeah. So I arrived at this point after 20 years of studying
*  these genes and Drosophila and other flies called the gap genes. I never want to hear,
*  you know, do anything with this anymore. But your favorite organism is Drosophila
*  melanogaster, right? Yeah, and different flies, they were really, I mean, this was a very rewarding
*  work. So I decided, I knew my strength was in theory very early on in my career, but I decided
*  to learn the empirical work in the lab and then became a group leader, exactly for the reason that
*  I wanted to have an empirical contribution and not just sit around and have theories
*  about other people's work. And I think that that's been paying off really well, always with the
*  thought in the background. So I was privileged to do this crazy master's under Brian Goodwin,
*  a master's degree in holistic science. And it was amazingly path changing for me and life changing
*  because it focused me. I mean, I was busy. I went to Brian because I had read his book,
*  How the Leopard Changed Its Spots at the time as a student, and also Stuart Kaufman's books
*  at that time. They were tremendously influential and a bunch of other people who worked in the
*  complexity sciences, they're back and these kind of people. But I really wanted to keep that in
*  mind. And then I got that priming there during that one year master's course of really thinking
*  about phenomenology, master of process thinking and all that really started. And I think I never
*  lost it. I did keep it. And through also a very decade long collaboration with my friend,
*  Nick Monk, who's a bio mathematician and process thinker. And we always kept on doing that and
*  publish these papers and relatively obscure journals. But when people ask me what are the
*  most important papers that you've written, I often put those papers first, because they were
*  intellectually the most sort of the guiding, you know, we did some really nice empirical stuff,
*  and the people who were involved in doing that work, I cannot tell you how great they were and
*  how rewarding it was to work with such people. But in the end, the big picture stuff is always
*  what I wanted to focus on. It's very difficult to do that. So you have to do evening work
*  during your normal scientific career, you have to compromise to survive if you want to survive,
*  or then you have to decide that you will do research outside the traditional academic system,
*  which is something that will become increasingly, we have to find ways to do that still, but it will
*  become increasingly the way to go for conceptual innovation, because the academic system, I'm sorry,
*  is not cutting it anymore. That's quite a place to end it. All right, Yogi. So I was excited,
*  I've been excited to have this conversation with you for a long time, because I love the course.
*  And I'm so glad that you agreed to come on and talk with me. It's been a real joy. So I'm really
