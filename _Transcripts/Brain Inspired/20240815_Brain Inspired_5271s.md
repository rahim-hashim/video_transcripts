Damian Kelty-Stephen is an experimental psychologist at State University of New York at New Paltz. Last episode with Luis Favela, we discussed many of the ideas from ecological psychology, and how Louie is trying to reconcile those principles with those of neuroscience. In this episode, Damian and I in some ways continue that discussion, because Damian is also interested in unifying principles of ecological psychology and neuroscience. However, he is approaching it from a different perspective that Louie. What drew me originally to Damian was a paper he put together with a bunch of authors offering their own alternatives to the computer metaphor of the brain, which has come to dominate neuroscience. And we discuss that some, and I'll link to the paper in the show notes. But mostly we discuss Damian's work studying the fractal structure of our behaviors, connecting that structure across scales, and linking it to how our brains and bodies interact to produce our behaviors. Along the way, we talk about his interests in cascades dynamics and turbulence to also explain our intelligence and behaviors. So, I hope you enjoy this alternative slice into thinking about how we think and move in our bodies and in the world.

# BI 191 Damian Kelty-Stephen Fractal Turbulent Cascading Intelligence
**Brain Inspired:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wI9goWxfvA)
*  We have fractal structure in the brain and I think that's not a coincidence and I think
*  that forks directly into all the other fractal stuff happening across the body.
*  Sometimes we're white noise, sometimes we're fractal, sometimes we can be all these things
*  and it might matter to help us understand what sort of perception action system we're
*  being.
*  Epistemological monism might require epistemological dualism or something.
*  I don't, I mean, it's a mess, but I try not to go back to the Big Bang.
*  Welcome to Brain Inspired.
*  Hi everyone, I'm Paul.
*  Damien Kelty-Steven is an experimental psychologist at State University of New York at New Pulse.
*  Last episode with Luis Favela, we discussed many of the ideas from ecological psychology
*  and how Luis is trying to reconcile those principles with those of neuroscience.
*  In this episode, Damien and I in some ways continue that discussion because Damien is
*  also interested in unifying principles of ecological psychology, ecological, ecological,
*  I don't know how to say it, of ecological psychology and neuroscience.
*  However, he is approaching it from a different perspective than Luis.
*  What drew me originally to Damien's work was a paper that he put together with a bunch
*  of authors from various fields offering their own alternatives to the computer metaphor
*  of the brain, which has become the dominant metaphor in neuroscience.
*  So we discussed that some and I'll link to the paper in the show notes, but mostly we
*  discussed Damien's work studying the fractal structure of our behaviors, connecting that
*  structure across scales and linking it to how our brains and bodies interact to produce
*  our behaviors.
*  Along the way, we talk about his interest in cascade dynamics and turbulence to also
*  explain our intelligence and behaviors.
*  So I hope you enjoy this alternative slice into thinking about how we think and move
*  in our bodies and in the world.

*  Thank you so much for being here.
*  Thank you for your support.
*  I hope you enjoy Damien.
*  So I had recently on and I'm not sure if your episode will come out before or after his.
*  I had Luis Favella on the podcast talking about his book and he's all about trying
*  to reconcile or at least that's what his book is about.
*  Trying to reconcile ecological psychology and neuroscience.
*  And so you're an experimental psychologist, correct?
*  Yes.
*  And I know that you have a background interest in ecological.
*  Is it ecological or ecological?
*  Okay.
*  The one's fine.
*  Psychology.
*  How did you get interested in that?
*  And I'll just start off by saying one of the reasons that I find your work interesting.
*  There's lots of reasons, but one of the things that you don't.
*  Care to throw out is is kind of a computational list perspective of how brains operate.
*  However, you know, you like many other ecological psych psychologist type people also want to
*  kind of resituate where the mind is, how like what we think of as the mind.
*  And so anyway, there's lots of interesting things that we'll get into.
*  But how did you were you always interested in ecological psychology or how did it?
*  It seems like people eventually fall into that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So I had never I did and I counsel students now I did all the wrong things going to grad
*  school like to make make my application the best and do the best interview.
*  Like I had no idea what I was doing and I'm very lucky and I keep thanking the people
*  who were very kind and generous at a time when I was not doing my share.
*  But so my I was introduced to my thesis advisor through my undergrad advisor who used to be
*  a coworker.
*  So Jay Dixon used to be at the College of William & Mary and my undergrad advisor saw
*  my my my work ethic and was like you would like Jay.
*  And so he sent he sort of said you should email Jay.
*  He was in the developmental division.
*  I had not done developmental psychology.
*  I did some infant research over the summer after I graduated to sort of brush up and
*  get some cred.
*  And I showed up to to grad school and some of the first things Jay shared with me to
*  read were the card 2004 the dynamic emergence of representation and Gottlieb.
*  So he started saying like basically here's the problem.
*  Like you start out as like a single cell and then you get all this stuff.
*  That's the problem.
*  I mean that's the problem.
*  And you know he was sort of you know there are other problems too but just sort of like
*  so from his developmental psychology perspective he said you know somehow things things come
*  out and the big question is how.
*  And so he wanted me to sort of read those those sources as sort of a leaping off point.
*  And then he said I don't know what they're doing but sort of in the neighboring division
*  in that department we have ecological psychology.
*  I was like what's that.
*  You know I should have done my homework.
*  He was like they want to explain lots of psychology stuff without referring to memory.
*  And I was like that sounds crazy.
*  And then I so I hung around with them.
*  I looked at the reading lists and then I was like you know I want to do the do the whole
*  thing I want to see what it's like.
*  And so I guess I you know converted myself and then I switched over while maintaining
*  the same advisor.
*  Some people think I work for Turvey and I didn't.
*  I was sort of like the stone and Turvey shoe while I was working for someone else.
*  It was sort of bureaucratically was a nightmare to pull off but everyone is very kind and
*  supportive.
*  So then Jay Jay is now director of CESPA and so he's sort of taken on that role.
*  So I did sort of bring him in.
*  But he did sort of like point them out to me saying like they're doing some interesting
*  stuff I don't understand it.
*  And he but so so to the point he had research with embodied cognition where he was looking
*  at the gear system problem which we published on a long time ago.
*  I had actually participated in the study as an undergrad when he was at the other place.
*  So but so he was very interested in this idea because he kept finding that what predicted
*  strategy changes aha moments from sort of tracing the gears to an alternating sequence
*  to eventually counting parity sort of progressively more abstract ways of thinking about the gear
*  system problem.
*  So Dixon was unsatisfied with the sort of the representational change because he was
*  like I bet it is but how and where and I don't see it like how are we just not restating
*  the problem.
*  And so what he sort of what what he and I were thinking about sort of like those people
*  over in CESPA do motor coordination and we're talking about motor coordination of a gear
*  system strategy and how does that work and what sort of indicators could we pull out
*  and then we start doing recurrence analysis we looked at entropy we started looking at
*  fractal stuff and then so you know that's where the fractal stuff came in because everything's
*  fractals these days to you right.
*  Sure.
*  A lot.
*  Yes.
*  And so but so I think it did come from this idea that you know sort of an outsider looking
*  in that was sort of hearing people say Gibson seems to say that like information is built
*  out of these bodily interactions that we have.
*  So what are the shape of those bodily interactions then.
*  And then but it did sort of crucially start with this very cognitive representation hungry
*  issue of sort of insight problems aha moments that kind of thing.
*  So I've never really wanted to trade up on it like I've always wanted to make sure we're
*  we're all talking about the same issues.
*  I don't I don't sometimes what I don't like about some ecological stuff is it becomes
*  a sort of thing.
*  Well you do your thing and we'll do our thing and we're just not going to talk about certain
*  issues.
*  I don't think that's not how I want to do it at least.
*  So that's an interesting perspective because I often think that people who have different
*  opinions are just talking past each other talking about different things.
*  So this idea of like you know kind of re situating where the target of explanation is.
*  I don't I don't know.
*  Are we all just talking about different things like like what do you what do you think about
*  brains for example.
*  I like them a lot.
*  So I think that they and what I say to my students sometimes is the same thing I say
*  to them about genes.
*  They do more and less than we think.
*  I think that there's you know there's undeniable participation of the brain.
*  The brain has specific structures and elements that do specific things.
*  But it's also you know what has this wild neural reuse capacity that Michael Anderson
*  is talking about sort of like it has all this flexibility.
*  So I have no problem with there being a brain and I actually have brain data you know working
*  on actually publishing one day someday soon we hope this summer.
*  But and so I think it's a wonderful example of how we have you know we have fractal structure
*  in the brain and I think that's not a coincidence and I think that forks directly into all the
*  other fractal stuff happening across the body.
*  So like I think that's I mean I think it's part of the part of the whole system.
*  I think so what I found compelling is that it's you know the nervous system is very flexible
*  and where it's traded in.
*  So it's got its flexibility and it paid for it with speed.
*  And so it's a slow system.
*  And so when you look at stuff the work from in the 80s with Tuller and Fowler and Kelso
*  and and and that that Teokis Bateson I can never remember the whole pronunciation of
*  that name.
*  But when they were looking at perturbations of speech sounds there were corrections and
*  these sort of these autonomous seeming synergies that seemed to complete the job faster than
*  neural transmission even within the head.
*  So like I think that the brain is definitely important and I think that but the body is
*  important too in a way that it's not it's not just sort of like a meat puppet that the
*  brain holds.
*  And so I think that there's stuff that the body can do that the brain maybe can't at
*  speeds that it sometimes can't.
*  But I think they mean when you start getting into the connective tissue and the tensegrity
*  stuff that Tervian Fonseca and other folks have gotten into it sort of like they're working
*  out the out sort of a way for these things to like collaborate and not be like antithetical
*  like so not be independent one could say.
*  Sure.
*  Right.
*  So when Don Ingber was early on or at least long before Tervian Fonseca got into it when
*  he was talking about tensegrity structures in systems bio he came up with a psychology
*  example.
*  He talked about a hair cell and hair cells in the ears have this wonderful sort of specificity.
*  You have specific hair cells for specific frequencies and he said that's you know like
*  this is one of the I mean I think that's one of the coolest examples and I think it shows
*  that sort of like one of these synthetic a priori is when we go like sound of Fourier
*  transform inside the ear like it's amazing.
*  And yet what Ingber was saying is if it's not situated in the right and I'm sort of
*  brushing here the the the basho like goo that the the the the extracellular matrix if it's
*  not situated in that that's going to keep it taught enough to fire nothing doing it
*  doesn't matter how much specific it looks like it does the situation of it in the sort
*  of the embodiment the housing the context for its activity is actually you know the premise
*  for that that specific independent activity of that single hair cell.
*  So that's sort of I think the brain is sort of just like a bigger story of that with lots
*  of different hair cell like activities that's you know looks independent and it is at some
*  scale of observation but then the bigger picture is that it's it's resting in collaboration with
*  this bigger the task in the body much like Randy Beer was talking about long ago.
*  So you're not a brain in a vat or an organoid brain organoid kind of kind of a person.
*  No.
*  So do neuroscientists have it all wrong or are they just looking at a time you know so
*  so in your view right the brain doesn't have the privileged position of being the seat of the mind
*  right. I'm curious like how you view neuroscientists because let me back up because like the way that I
*  see ecological psychology is like they eschew the brain right but you know like it's almost like a
*  behaviorism sort of outlook in that sense but I but my sense of you is that you do appreciate
*  the brain but I'm curious if you think that neuroscientists just have it all backwards or
*  wrong or just misplaced. I so I think and sometimes it's even it's not even like some
*  ecological psychologists I would say even at some specific people many of them maybe who are saying
*  things in certain contexts and there's a lot of like politicking that goes into making a scientific
*  movement and I would say and it goes on both sides I don't think it's just echo and I don't think it's
*  just neuro but I think that that folks have when when put on the spot said very like snotty things
*  and so and I think I mean many people in many camps and many different scholarly disciplines
*  have done that but I think that some people have said well we don't need the brain so let's forget
*  it and that I disagree with that last part. Isn't that crazy? It is. That's just a crazy thought.
*  I think it is so they will cite sort of lots of interesting sort of reflex activity in decapitated
*  or de-seraprated animals but that doesn't like we still have our brain attached and so I haven't
*  ever gotten on board with that so the and and I think when you actually sit and talk with some
*  of those sort of extreme sounding folks they do actually have a nuanced view and they understand
*  that yeah that was a heated moment and that's it's hard to pick through all those little
*  encounters. Neuroscientists I don't think they're doing some like I don't think it is
*  a wholesale wrong field. I think they're doing what many different
*  sort of scientists do. You have a model system, you mine it, you come up with insights from it
*  and sometimes you bump up again and this is true for ecological psychologists as it is for
*  neuroscientists and that like you know so there's sort of there's points where you bump up against
*  the boundaries of your model system and you sort of have a choice well am I going to go
*  learn something new and like very often this is what I hear it's not so sort of like I have a
*  theoretical you know limitation or objection it's like no I just I'm you know I have these
*  I have limited time to do a certain set of things for an academic job and I can't learn new things
*  and like I totally get it and I have not felt sort of like I mean some people will sort of say
*  well your stuff sounds weird but I don't necessarily feel like well that's wrong and I cannot I'm not
*  on board with this. So yeah like I don't so I think that I think there's a lot of sort of
*  there are a lot of false dichotomies that get thrown around like if I will say sometimes
*  that like you know I like embodiment I want to sort of think not just about how the brain is
*  controlling things but how the physics of the body move and then the the sort of bad faith things
*  on the other side that that gets said is that well we can't reduce with all the particle physics
*  it's like well that's there's a very far distance between let's not just do that and particle
*  physics and I think that there's I think I think there's like people understand that things need
*  to change and things are siloed and sometimes people just don't know what to do and I think
*  they'll just say well here's my thing and like I get it I don't really I'm not worried about
*  like the course of science or something like that. So what is your thing? My thing? Yeah.
*  The thing I am trying to focus on and the thing I'm trying to sort of run through as many different
*  model systems so I guess so if you took your sort of like I mean the thing I'm trying to do is sort
*  of make a ladder that goes all the way up and down these scales all the way from across different
*  model systems across different species and look to see is this fractal stuff have any leverage
*  in sort of addressing the structure and having any sort of entailment for what for what someone
*  else who doesn't care about fractals would say it's doing. So I don't like the proliferation
*  of sort of like oh here's this thing it's fractal oh here's this thing it's fractal like that
*  strikes me like I like fractal things and I know yeah for people listening he has was it Mendelbrot?
*  Mendelbrot. Yes Mendelbrot probably Mendelbrot he was french but yeah that's the Mendelbrot set so
*  like I like this stuff. So people watching can see a fractal behind you but I get you know just for
*  just for clarity what is a fractal why is a fractal interesting and why do you see fractal
*  structure everywhere? So you will see fractal structures okay so it is a kind of scale
*  invariant process where as you zoom in you will see progressively more texture. It was first we
*  sort of first had a glimmer that it was something that we needed to worry about when people were so
*  the the founder of numerical weather forecasting was starting to ask pesky questions about whether
*  or not there was a there was such a thing as velocity of wind and he said like I know
*  like he wrote in the paper like I know this sounds silly but just wait like you know that's the
*  modern version but he was like saying you know when you look at an average you can calculate one
*  but the actual theoretical definition of an average means that as you get to smaller and smaller
*  scales that you're going to get stability and that we don't get that and so as you zoom in you get
*  more you get a very slow diminishing of variability you get more than you would expect from
*  sort of a scale dependent model where you just expect okay here's my scale here's the behavior
*  fractal systems are ones that that have a rapid growth of variability as you scale out and a very
*  sort of a persistent slow growth of them as you zoom in because you keep on seeing more
*  new structure so sometimes it's called hyper diffusive and so the the wind particles that
*  that Richardson studied were you know hyper diffusive in in the sense in the sort of the
*  garden variety sort of physics sense of like a particle spreading through space and so his
*  views of diffusion were actually different from Carl Pearson's and Einstein's idea in 1905 about
*  ordinary diffusion and sort of ordinary diffusion was sort of the particle moves randomly in
*  independent directions at each time step what Richardson was finding around the same time was
*  like oh no actually things things are clumpy and move together in clumps and then sort of there's
*  there's a lot of correlation across space and time so things can sort of accumulate things aren't
*  just sort of like completely homogeneously random so that so there are so the clumpiness
*  of a structure of a movement of a process that that's sort of hard like when you when you make
*  a geometrical model of that and Richardson once tried to sort of make a model of like a peat field
*  because he was supposed to sort of figure out what like where it should be cut to to get the
*  most efficient drainage and he realized that like you can't do a Euclidean model of this that's
*  accurate if you could you could he said but it wouldn't it would take so long you like everything
*  would be dead and over by the time you were done and so so and so what he was noticing was that you
*  get sort of like in the coastline of Britain as he he he's sort of helped point out later you get
*  these nooks and crannies and it's really hard to sort of like make a perfect sketch with lines
*  planes solids and stuff like that like like from the Euclidean geometry and so instead what you have
*  rather than so so so you sort of have to take stock if you care about this stuff and want to
*  get into it you have to take stock of how dimension in the Euclidean sense is really about diffusion
*  it's about how many different ways or directions a thing is spreading out so a point isn't spreading
*  out at all a line is spreading out in one one direction a plane has two directions of extent
*  and so so really dimension is about diffusion and so Richardson and Mandelbrot were sort of saying
*  yeah and diffusion could actually go between the cracks it could it could be non-integer you could
*  have you could have lines that are craggy enough to be almost planes so and so that and so so so
*  fractal modeling really really doesn't have to be anything spooky and new it sort of goes back to
*  that old problem that Pearson was was working on and you know people like the solution there and
*  it's much more popular the idea that standard deviation grew according to a square root of time
*  fractal stuff is like well yeah it can but it can also grow according to other rates of time
*  depending on how viscous your circumstances are like there's so it's it's a more continuous
*  range of possibilities and so yeah so that's that's all very interesting for those who care
*  but I sort of quickly realized that many people were sort of like trying to generate these results
*  and then they're like and it's fractal and like I'd say eight eighty seven ninety ninety five percent
*  of the audience doesn't care because they don't know what it means and so and so I so what I'm
*  trying to do is I'm trying to say okay what do people care about what I mean like and I wanted
*  my own sort of pre-SESPA questions answered about how does perception work when I come up with a
*  judgment when I come up with an interpretation I choose a path like well how can I predict those
*  things after so what I what I sort of do is sort of I look at sort of the standard explanation
*  account of a perceptual judgment cognitive response and I try to like dig into the task
*  look for all the usual suspects and say okay here here the usual suspects and then I'm also going to
*  measure the fractal structure of different parts of the body as they they engage in the task and
*  then I've started slowly getting into like okay now I'm going to actually start manipulating the
*  fractal structure of things within that task or the stimulation that I give to them and and all
*  these things it's like I haven't been able to so I so at every turn and maybe this is my own bias
*  and maybe I'm just seeing things but it seems that the fractal structure does matter to how
*  people use the existing task structures or constraints that that everyone knows and everyone
*  agrees on so the usual suspects matter but then what are the usual suspects oh well just yeah so
*  I'm just like for instance in so in ecological psychology they have perceived length as a function
*  of the inertial moments of a handheld object that's just sort of like that's a that's a real
*  simple version where sort of like we understand when you wield an object that it has an inertia
*  tensor to it that that that you know as you as you hold that object and wield it around
*  you know according to the ecological folks like that this information is invariantly specifying
*  the response when when you average those responses as it turns out but there's all
*  sorts of reasons for so so they also found that well some people have different impressions of
*  the these these um the some different conclusions about perceived length you can give feedback and
*  you can change how people use those same inertial quantities and so that's sort of so so helping them
*  figure out which it which inertial properties matter is attunement and figure out how to scale
*  those properties to an eventual judgment is calibration and then and so feedback can help
*  all that stuff and that's I mean sort of that's like a psychophysical learning study I don't think
*  there's anything unusual about that but sort of within that scale that's sort of all the things
*  I named those those inertial properties the presence or absence of feedback the number of
*  blocks in the sequence those would be the usual suspects and so you sort of so I I would do
*  sort of shotgun models full factorial like let's let it all interact like just sort of
*  control for all the different factors how they might it interact across many trials in this study
*  and then I would add the the fractal parameter that I would have estimated off of each person's
*  movement on each single trial the ecological psychologists when I first did this were like
*  this isn't going to work this is bonkers so like and I was like why it's like because were they
*  against it in principle or were they just just thinking I mean it wouldn't work so the thing one
*  thing that I'm that I'm struggling with in that on that end is this whole idea of the ecological
*  or behavioral scale or scales and then so it's this idea and it comes in with sort of how we
*  talk about affordance and how we talk about action-based variables I like the idea that
*  intention is real I like the idea that intention feeds feeds into it but ecological scale is a
*  that's that suggests a bandwidth below which and above which we will not go and if you read if you
*  read gibson 79 in the opening pages he sort of says some pretty brash things about it we don't need
*  small stuff we don't need big stuff like and then and so anyway so regards so he said other things
*  and it's like quoting the bible honestly you can find various things in there um yeah but he had
*  this idea he also changed his mind god forbid like you know you're we're allowed to change our mind
*  and so so he so basically this idea that dynamic touches like a a wielding experience that you do
*  intentionally to extract and to detect information you're going to use for a purpose
*  that's led people to say well or that did lead people to say um like I don't think this will work
*  because the the the fractal stuff is scale invariant and the tiny stuff doesn't that's not at
*  the ecological scale um so there's I'm I'm uh worried that we're losing people with some of
*  the terminology like um already but no no that's okay because you mentioned cascades and I wanted
*  to jump on that but just sticking with fractals for a moment um so you see multi-fractal structure
*  across scales right and you know you can do this in many tasks uh an example that you often give
*  is walking right so your body movements while you're walking um have a fractal can be described or
*  modeled as fractal in nature just simply the movements right within your environment um
*  sorry this is gonna be a naive question but is fractality in that case or in all of this is it
*  causal or is it descriptive of what's happening no I think that's not that is the question and
*  that's sort of the thing I've been trying to sort of get at okay um where because sort of like people
*  will say so I think in a lot like there was a heyday in the 80s where fractal structure became
*  sort of sort of latched on to self-organized criticality and some people say that's fractal
*  must be self-organized and they they have this model where they have the word self-organized
*  in it and it's about self-organized criticality and that's actually a very limited model it's a
*  it is a cascade it's really it has two scales to my what is a cascade sorry I'm gonna yeah that's
*  fine so what is what is a cascade a cascade is anytime so you can think about it as like an
*  actual waterfall you have sort of the stream toppling off the edge and it breaks into
*  successively smaller strings so mathematically you can think about that big current as like a
*  uniform probability distribution one big bin and then as you let it unfold it it it breaks
*  and it break and this so it's sort of like it's like like a cookie you know as you break parts of
*  the cookie you sort of inevitably their asymmetries and those asymmetries stay as you break those
*  asymmetrical parts into further smaller parts you can also get you know aggregations but so so like
*  it's sort of like branchings of a tree so you'll often hear about branching but so but so anytime
*  you have this sort of like splaying out or sort of siphoning in that that's so what what you have
*  when you do that is if you if you're measuring downstream what you're seeing is this the the
*  product of many successive breakings apart okay rather than so the opposite or a different thing
*  not necessarily the opposite but one is like white noise which is independent independently sampled
*  items across a sequence each independently selected from the same distribution repeatedly
*  and though and white noise can be can be treated as it's it's producible as the sum of oscillations
*  at many different frequencies okay so that so sometimes people will say well if everything's
*  fractal it doesn't that mean nothing's fractal and doesn't mean we can't yeah that would be my yeah
*  right so white no but some my response to that is white noise was like that like before you know
*  pesky people brought up pink noise or fractal noise and all these things it was all white noise
*  and there wasn't a problem like it's it's not so it was all white noise and we still survived and
*  we still made progress and learned things white noise was just sort of the background premise for
*  the linear model that lets us fit these and test these deterministic components there's no there's
*  no big problem the question is what's your background what sort of what background framing
*  assumptions are there for your modeling that you do later so the cascade idea is that there are
*  that you can't just assume identically independently distributed noise that's just a sum of all the
*  things that you haven't looked at um so i'm not sure if this is i mean you know our conversation
*  can go anywhere but one of the um one of the pieces of uh writing that you participated in
*  and i guess led was this um list of alternative metaphors for the brain um and and your alternative
*  metaphor was cascade the brain as cascade instability um can you can you just describe that um yeah well
*  so i mean sorry the background is that um the computer metaphor for the brain is is tired and
*  old now you know and and that whatever modern technology is around we always liken the brain
*  to whatever fancy best technology we have and in fact in fact a couple days ago i was participating
*  in a day-long retreat for the part of the program that i'm a part of at my university and in one of
*  the panels um you know someone someone kind of nonchalantly said the brain is a computer uh you
*  know just definitively without any irony without you know any consideration of anything else and
*  you know i almost screamed out no it's not but that would have been the wrong thing to scream out
*  yes um i said it's not i should have said well it's not only a computer and then but that i didn't
*  want to derail us or whatever so that that's kind of the background is that everyone likens the brain
*  to a computer these days and i know you're a fan of touring as well yes yeah so so what is it yeah
*  go ahead well so i didn't i didn't follow so i think i can sort of weave in what i didn't answer
*  about your earlier question was sort of is fractal a descriptor is it is it is it a is it causal i
*  think it's it is it's a it's a it's an observation you can make about current sets of affairs that
*  can can actually entail something farther ahead so to to get to a cascade one of the big cascades in
*  the room is evolution and evolution being much bigger than just sort of neo darwinist
*  sort of selection of genotype and you know at least selection of phenotype anyway but so that
*  so evolution you can look at those like trees of sort of speciation and and actually you you can
*  find an imprint of so and that's like that's a cascade so you can find an imprint of that cascade
*  in the multifractal structure of the genetic code which sounds weird 1995 when i was in you know
*  academic diapers i someone else was looking at the multifractal structure of genetic sequences
*  across multiple different species and they're able to use that to do cluster analysis of sort of like
*  the different phyla and so you can you can predict using yeah basically but that doesn't mean that
*  it's causal right well what's so what's causal is the the i mean so it's it's as much it's an
*  operation of a cause in which the causes are these non-linear interactions through a cascade
*  so i so i the the the difference between cause and operationalization we've all got it on all
*  sides of this where the the brain is just a storehouse of operationalizations there are things
*  happening and and it's so we all got our operationalizations i'm not so i'm not so
*  worried about that but the so what i'm saying is the the underlying construct here is the the
*  cascade process that we are engaged in currently and that ultimately like has has a ragged edge
*  where at some point it does kind of matter what you had for breakfast not in a way that like is
*  sort of easily dis so sort of compartmentalized as as we might like in a linear model but if we've
*  got a cascade generating all these species we've got this this evolutionary cascade made a brain
*  made a body made all these other species you may have helped sort of shape this in
*  um whole environment and so i mean like where you exactly so like experimentally you can
*  jump in and inject a manipulation that has multifractal structure and show that when
*  you manipulate that multifractal structure you can get a difference in response so so that's
*  that's not sort of like proof positive and we'll never get proof positive of many of these manipulations
*  ever but you so something about cascade structures speaks to the construction of a cognitive
*  perceptual response and so i suspect that i mean though i cannot latch hold of all the different
*  cascades going into our conversation right now i we can do the same experimental framework where
*  we can we can grab hold of some of them change them and measure the response so it's at least
*  falsifiable and it so the numbers themselves aren't positive they are they are currently
*  the best possible way to to describe the cascade that is under the curtain basically and so so it's
*  the best way for me to say it's it's gotlib again and gotlib what gotlib said is true and is also
*  it's also it's falsifiable it's not a theory of everything as some people think when they see the
*  gotlib it looks like everything is everything i know it but so now we can be clear about okay so if
*  if something like this is true and it means something then we can actually quantify that
*  whether it's in an experimental manipulation or in obs of observable covariates and we can put that
*  into our model and it can live right right alongside all the other independent factors
*  that we also think matter so so the the metaphor replacement is cascade instability what is the
*  where does the instability come in oh cascades are always instability it's just sort of it's a
*  i mean you can actually that but that's not true you can have perfectly regular cascades
*  but we are so so so so you can do a perfectly deterministic cascade where you always take
*  one quarter and one and three quarters out of the stream at each step you could do that very rare i
*  don't think that's but self-organized systems that would i mean you with the recurrence and
*  non-linearities that's that just falls apart immediately yeah i would say i would say okay
*  so okay so yeah so the the so an active actually right now um we currently my colleague and i uh
*  mongolam um he and i have a bunch of cascade simulations trying to figure out sort of like
*  how many different kinds of noise can you pipe into the cascade to get you know what sort of
*  diversity of responses because like you know we've we have a long history of sort of empirically
*  saying okay this seems to matter correlationally we have some experiments we'd like to sort of
*  look at these metrics and sort of have some more theoretical expectations about what kind of cascade
*  can you think of the cascade as sort of like so can can can you start making a model as paul
*  bogdan i'm not sure how to pronounce that name b-o-g-d-a-n um has has been sort of showing like
*  it's it's it could be useful to understand physiological systems by having like a network
*  of multifractal observables and could you look at how how each of those those nodes
*  multifractal contribution spreads how contagious is this and so so how so so think about sort of like
*  linking a bunch of actual waterfalls to each other and and you make some sort of like rub gold work
*  of sort of you know massively interactive fluid dynamical systems and so we've got cascade
*  simulations where we're sort of starting to ask exactly that question like if you run so if you
*  have at each generation if you are fragmenting according to a multifractal noise signal what
*  are you going to see at the at the bottom of the waterfall and then how does that correspond to
*  what we see in our measures interestingly one thing we've been doing and so is sort of also
*  modeling cascades where rather than a non-linearity will inject generations of
*  additivity as if to sort of like a sort of to sort of begin simulating what it's like to sort of
*  jam in independent constraints which we have to if we're going to do clinical interventions or
*  experimental manipulations we we pride ourselves on those being independent so like so we were
*  and so interestingly some of the most realistic looking series to our eyes comes from that when
*  you sort of have this sort of compromise in in the mathematics between interactivity and these sort
*  of add-on constraints just just backing up a little bit we didn't talk about this up front but
*  your world view so i've come to really appreciate process philosophy and viewing everything as a
*  flow and you know modern neuroscience yes dynamical systems theory is used more and more to
*  explain the activity of massive populations of neurons and and yet the language and i think the
*  world view of most neuroscientists is still all about sort of states and it's much more a static
*  thing and you know when you're talking about cascades i just i imagine you you have that same
*  everything is a flow world view is that right um maybe i like that you're recognizing that but
*  i'm more of a patian and i try to cite him often where he is at least and i don't know how far he
*  got with this um he's been very kind when i've asked him if if i made a mistake saying certain
*  things with his his his work um he hasn't said anything negative he's been been is he still
*  active he's my understanding is he's he's retired and he's he said he was reading things that he
*  never made time for before and i don't want to trouble that this is howard pete howard pete
*  yes so suny binghamton i believe but um and so he he says that you can't just have flows and you
*  can't just have constraints and that we need some sort of complementing of that and like i like that
*  idea and i can't not like that idea as i and like it sounds much mouth and it sounds sort of like
*  well i guess every i guess like it's another everything matters kind of thing but i think
*  yeah that's how i actually feel about when i fit those sort of experimental constraints
*  and then i look at how the body is flowing within that so like my statistical models i think are at
*  least sort of trying to do that sort of thing where i'm acknowledging i don't i don't want to
*  like i don't want to say you don't need a brain i don't want to say that it doesn't matter like
*  you know when i do single word recognition studies or like i'm looking at i'm using
*  word frequency like i'm looking at the corpora that the psycholinguists have like those are real
*  things and they matter and they're they're fit like for the purposes of the study they're fixed
*  so they may as well i mean they're constraints and so i think those are a process philosopher
*  would just call constraints and while you were talking about constraints i was thinking oh man
*  are fractals just constraints but a process philosopher would say well a constraint is just
*  a slower flow than the thing that it's constraining right yeah yeah and i yeah so okay so in that sense
*  i i could i might be a process philosopher and i admit entirely that that's entirely frustrating
*  because then it's a question of when scale happened and i have a colleague david farrokh
*  who will continually ask me sort of like what what came first and and and so that's back up but what
*  do you mean it's it's frustrating because it's a problem because because then you're just saying
*  yeah because it's because because okay so that there are parts where pete says so he was one of
*  these two i guess that the constraints are built so maybe he wasn't saying they really are flows
*  but he was saying they're built from flows at another scale right i like that idea because
*  it's at least not it's at least not sort of saying well i just told you it's a thing and it's actually
*  just the other thing again um so but i think i think that we really something i'm really struggling
*  with is sort of how we ourselves with our measurement circumstance and our experimental
*  paradigm we put ourselves into the into the behavior we when we're when we're deciding what
*  to study we do set like and within that frame there are these like whether or not they were
*  flows once or they become constraints and that's part of our description and we sort of can't get
*  away from that i think and so and that's that's the sense the sense in which i think i would still
*  call a constraint a constraint um without without blinking and then sure so like people but like
*  when you look at sort of like so the the boiling point of water people have said well that's that's
*  fixed that's scale scale dependent i was like right but if you like change the shape of the pan
*  and you go up a mountain like you're gonna get different like it's actually like and and that's
*  that's that that right there is processing i guess but it's also acknowledging that yes given given
*  the circumstances that you've set up this is fixed and gravity is 9.8 like though we're not
*  changing that right now um so like it's i do struggle with i one one time i i think i told
*  david froak like maybe maybe what did i say ontological monism might have might
*  might require epistemological dualism or something i don't i mean it's a mess but i try not to go
*  back to the big bang and like what what was the first like i that's that isn't my my qualifications
*  and that's not where i fell in love with the psychological content so i sort of don't i'm not
*  an expert on there is probably wildly inconsistent as you go back to the big bang and i don't know
*  what to say let's not do that yeah okay yeah which may or may not have happened it turns out right
*  the other thing that's the other thing right so yeah i lost track of where we were we were
*  talking about cascade instability and relating to the process yeah yeah well yeah i interrupted and
*  and and you were saying it's more pati like your yeah i think so and so i think that i think it's
*  really so i i i was i was looking at your questions and you had stuff about sort of like ai and what
*  is ai missing and like i think i mean i think so dennis waters who's a who's a student of patis
*  wrote in his recent book that like you know that much of the problem is that it's all constraints
*  so it's all symbolic logic i mean like you're just doing math and what is what oh the problem
*  with ai the the what ai is missing yeah oh okay yeah so so it's missing constraints is that what
*  you're no no no no it's missing it's missing flows or it flows it's actually not acknowledging the
*  flows like right but see that's the thing is like are our flow is that important then because ai is
*  awesome right it's doing cool stuff yeah yeah and it's doing the some i mean you know connectionist
*  static version of computing essentially and it's not acknowledging flows but maybe we don't need
*  flows then um i think so we only we have so the thing is our computers have flows in them we only
*  notice them when our computer breaks and then we're sort of like where it's like oh crap yeah now i
*  have to think about the material embodiment like we sort of build these things to do a job and they
*  do them really well um but i still think we're dealing with the same old problems with computer
*  mod like it's the same moment like the like i remember reading stuff about like you know
*  how we solve the frame problem it's like the the the gbt powered you know diagnostic programs don't
*  understand that people have to leave to go to the bathroom like right and then so there's just
*  stuff like and that's like maybe a pain in the butt kind of complaint but it's like it's showing
*  we like these programs are great at what they do in a narrow task space they don't have context
*  and they are not and so like they're fine they're really cool models i i i'm fascinated by them
*  i am not convinced that's like all of it like we're not but but what maybe it's all of quote
*  unquote intelligence so you know i'm curious about your views on like even what intelligence is like
*  if ai uh you know can perfectly answer all of our questions and will ask us if we want to go to the
*  bathroom every whatever hour or two um my own views of like thinking well you know i think
*  ai is awesome also i think it's i think it's missing flows also but i'm not i can't articulate
*  why i find that to be important except for more of x paradox right which is like
*  playing chess is easy grabbing a cup is hard the things that we think are easy are actually hard
*  to implement in ai and vice versa it turns out i mean so it does i think i mean i go back to the
*  whole development perspective where i started from where it's sort of like where did it come from
*  and like how does it get there like i think it's it's a very cool device we've made we made very
*  smart software but it's still just doing math but is that what intelligence is no i don't i don't i
*  think intelligence is not just math um i think intelligence has i mean it's it has it seeks it
*  that's agency though right so is agent if that's what if i'm reading right i think agents i think
*  agency is i i i have a difficult time thinking about an inert intelligence that is incurious and
*  it just has all of what it has you need to go find what you're interested in and you fight the way we
*  understand i mean intelligence whatever people report it's not sort of i mean like so what chat
*  gbt can it can it was really good at the psych ap exam really early on which i i find amusing
*  but it can you know it can answer these it can answer very narrowly constrained questions it
*  could be it's a very useful tool as people are ideating and sort of mocking up you know scripts
*  that they're going to use somewhere you know like um it's not i don't see it i guess intelligence
*  for me has more of uh has more of the emotionality and the interest and the bias that we sort of have
*  in our what we recognize as intelligent like intelligence for us isn't sort of just having a
*  base of facts you can like dump out like that's somehow not still we we are impressed by people
*  who can do that but that isn't i don't think that is clearly what we think of as intelligent
*  i worry that my own view is evolving in such a way that i am in my mind sort of equating
*  intelligence with life processes but what i want to be able to do is just let go and say okay maybe
*  intelligence is just not is a is a thing that we can call and maybe i'm not as interested as
*  as i thought i was in intelligence maybe i'm actually more interested in the life processes
*  right that seem super quote unquote intelligence but then it's just oh how can that thing exist
*  that's pretty damn intelligent right so you know then i i just wonder oh am i just collapsing back
*  to your worry that everything is everything and yeah well so i i remember my students so i was
*  teaching a seminar in ecological psychology to my master's students here last semester and like
*  they they had just heard some of them had just heard about like ant robots i forgot what
*  michael levin came out with some some really cool i forgot the proper name but they were self-building
*  wet robots that like learned to solve a maze i don't have all the details i'm sorry michael if
*  you're seeing this but um but yeah but and so the students were terrified they're like wait
*  so there aren't any past experiences here to look like there was like all the stuff they thought
*  about learning and like oh you train this train this model give it this experiences and i was
*  like right sometimes like i wouldn't i'm not smart enough to have built what he built but i'm like
*  right sometimes the output doesn't look like whatever generating process that that gave you
*  like learning is not just mimicry you can't you can't that's not so so train the model on a on a
*  on a set you can get some really phenomenal stuff i think we have other cases where you're getting
*  you know intelligent as it seems to me intelligent like behaviors solving problems
*  coordinating with a social group making decisions like there's there's stuff that does that seems
*  to fall out of this um paradigm of sort of have the model tested on the heap and then see what
*  comes out um so yeah so and i think some of it comes down to what what turing said about how like
*  you know it'd be cool and he was spitballing and potentially just sort of like kind of be funny but
*  like it'd be cool if you could have this like these these nodes sort of walk through the countryside
*  and build up like a set of experiences like this would never work because that's not how like actual
*  humans work either so so yeah so like i just i feel like there's there's embodiment that
*  when when when mar and all of them started talking about multiple realizability it was sort of like
*  hey folks you you have flows you have the electrons running through that's always working
*  you know the housing you always need something to make it but like that actually doesn't matter
*  we're just going to work strictly in terms of constraints that can be built however you like
*  and that's where it's sort of like i think that like we're able to make constraints do a lot of
*  cool stuff but like we built that and like that and that's and we we did that not because not
*  because we are a set of constraints but you know there's a lot of exploration and a lot of inquiry
*  and agency if if that's what it it is and if that's a different thing that's a different thing but
*  sort of like there's the the housing matters in a way that i think um doesn't always come out in the
*  in the telling i don't i'm fairly certain i could not pass an ap psychology test right now
*  oh okay i'm sure i couldn't right now so if you were going to build ai um you would you would
*  start with turbulence i well so that that would be cool i think and actually robert wood and harvard
*  actually has what like he has had he was sort of working on actually um turning instability reaction
*  diffusion spiders that were sort of like given a plastic mesh i think it's really i mean i think
*  it's really cool i think i i think potentially a lot of these robots actually have turbulence
*  in them and they can't help it i'm just sorry i'm going to interrupt you and yeah because this is
*  the first time i've mentioned turbulence um and uh so so why is turbulence interesting uh to you
*  um turbulence is fractal um and so there it is again yeah everything's fractal well so turbulence
*  is was recognized as sort of this this strange case where suddenly laminar flow which does happen
*  so laminar flow does happen and but when you push a fluid beyond the bounds of what the container
*  and the fluid can maintain it'll generate these coils and that's sort of you start to see it with
*  a rolling boil in a boiling pot of water for instance and so turbulence is this case where
*  the the the world start to contain worlds and vortices and you can get these sort of these
*  these structures blinking in and out of existence so you can get thing and so the thing that we've
*  got sort of terrifying i think for people when they realize like oh we can model these eddies
*  that sort of weren't didn't exist before and we can model them as their particles sort of like the
*  giant red spot on on jupiter sort of like that's not a dot that's a fluid vortex that's just sort
*  of very self-sustaining and so so yeah so i think that so when people started developing the so i
*  recently had this i'll just fast forward i recently had this very exciting conversation with uh
*  scholar works on network models i don't know much about what the framework was or what the
*  background was but he is having these models talk to the talk to each other and then he's looking
*  to see what they do and i think that's really exciting to see what the how these things
*  interact with each other and i kept when i was at at harvard med school i would sort of talk to these
*  folks who are making these robots and i'd say you are you know you're coming up with really exciting
*  machines here that we don't know what they're going to do and that's sort of cool because you
*  know we're taking away all the control and the rodney brooks idea of just sort of letting
*  solutions emerge like you have some robots here and where it'd be cool to like measure what they're
*  doing and if they like it'd be cool to see if they like successful intelligent performance
*  aligned with any of the stuff that i've got and they're like i yeah they didn't just say go away
*  get away from me they didn't quite say go away but but i just sort of like i feel like there
*  there is already i mean without without needing to like stick these robots into a pot and boil
*  them or something there's already this we're seeing you know robots with fluidity of movement
*  and and randomness and in such a way that i think there's already stuff in there and i think that's
*  probably would help models and sort of help understand like oh and that that's that's the
*  run and when it toppled over oh and that's when it hit the hit the target like i think that like
*  i think i'm really excited with how flexible and adaptive a i and robotics has gotten and i just
*  think that like now we as soon as we're building in that noise it's like oh i have some ideas about
*  what sort of noise might actually contribute to this and so it's you know whether i ever get to
*  test that i don't i don't know but yeah yeah well that's okay so this is interesting like how do you
*  so you can you i think of fractality and scale-freeness as something that emerges from
*  you know the the interacting self-organized interacting parts right yes but and so i haven't
*  thought i mean so would you build fractality in using the right kind of noise or or is is it
*  something that emerges and also contributes right there's the causal loop right i so it's sort of
*  like i was saying like i think that you will get so as you let a bunch of pieces fall fall into
*  a circumstance things it's it's i think that you will get interactions that will proceed across
*  scales and what that means for a system you can't know really with without modeling the fractal
*  structure of those behaviors so in that sense like it's i think it goes back to your earlier
*  question like is it a description or is it cause i think it's a description of the causes that in
*  of a class that we haven't haven't talked about when we look at individual pieces and what they do
*  right so so okay so you wouldn't build fractality and you'd build the cause of the fractalness
*  into it yes and and but honestly like in order to do be a polite scientist and understand that
*  and also out of bare curiosity i'd want to build in the manipulations to actually
*  manipulate like explicitly build in fractal structure into different energy
*  uh energy sources and textures like that would be i i would expect that we would want that
*  experimental control to say oh yes this matter do that do whatever cultivated or allow to happen
*  whatever cultivated that pattern before we experimentally manipulated because that's
*  going to give you this class of fractal structure and we'll know that thereby not because of the
*  fractal structure but we'll know because the fractal structure is is indicative of what what
*  it operationalizes these these pattern of patterns of cascade so when we're doing the
*  simulations we're trying to figure out what kind of interactions are give you this that or the
*  other kind of response um and so i think that you want to do both in the same way that like we sort
*  of we we do this in neuroscience too where we have the chemical that we that we think runs through
*  this pathway and we have the chemical that you know you're genetically disposed to have more or
*  less or this or that pathway for and like we'd like people to be born with the happy effective
*  flows of of specific neurotransmitters and that might predict all sorts of happy
*  intellectual cognitive developmental outcomes but then we want to know how how can you get in there
*  and how can you enter into that what's what sort of what what language is are those causes speaking
*  in and they're speaking to us in terms of how we find them in fractal structure and so we can enter
*  into them and we sort of have a handshake with them in fractal structure as well so if you you're
*  measuring a an artificial intelligence system and you don't find fractal structure like it is is
*  fractality like a necessary marker of uh whatever we consider intelligence right so you don't find
*  it can it be can it can you even fathom that something would be could act intelligently in
*  the world without fractal structure does that make sense i know it's an unfair question yeah
*  no no that's fine um so i think so when okay so the whole motivation for multi-fractality is that
*  there isn't just one so i want to sort of preface that yeah talk about multi-fractality like what it
*  is also so right so so it's sort of not so so when you when you take so the coastline of britain or
*  that coastline right there you can you you can estimate one one one dimension for the whole
*  thing the whole coastline the whole mandelbrot set you can sort of sketch out exactly how craggy
*  it is and how how craggy it remains as you unpack it if you measure different places
*  within that coastline and and the coastline of britain you will get different variations you
*  will get higher and lower than that sort of one dimension to rule them all and so so so and that
*  that variability like it's not just so a linear modeler would say oh that's just unsystematic
*  error you have small samples and you're getting wobble in that and it turns so you can test that
*  and very often it's not that very often what you get are variations in the fractal dimension
*  across that based on these non-linear correlations so you would get an excess often of the variation
*  beyond what so so linear models can generate multi-fractal noise and so and there's there's
*  a heated debate whether anyone cares but i think the reason people care is because lots of folks
*  don't care about multi-factuals and they only say i'm pretty happy doing my linear model why are you
*  troubling me with this and like and that's very honest i think and also even if it is just small
*  samples we got small samples all the time and we want to know that this is not that well also
*  linear linear models are interpretable right and so and so even even if you're using them as
*  knowing that they're incorrect because all models are wrong but some are useful but it's it's sort
*  of an estimate or a maybe a bird's eye view of what's going on right and so yeah which is so
*  let's let's put a pin in that point because i want to get back to that okay but so but so so yeah so
*  i think that when so if i so so when i was first coming out with the fractal analysis of behavior
*  and seeing how that changed with cognitive or perceptual changes the thing i i haven't sort of
*  like you know i the thing i suspect the thing i have seen repeatedly is as people get get sort of
*  into a groove into the constraints of the task as the rule stabilizes they get less fractal so
*  they're so they start looking more like white noise and and that is in some sense a blessing
*  depending on the task like when they're performing well when they're engaged like in a flow state or
*  something yes yes and so and so it sort of it gets sort of swept off the table very often because
*  so for instance if you think about it in terms of temporal estimation so wallet and kuznetsov 2011
*  did a wonderful study that said exactly or was exemplifying what i wanted people to see is that
*  actually no like fractal isn't always good fractal it means a thing it means and so when you have
*  temporal estimation and you give people feedback to say okay so no you're you're a little long
*  you're a little short but but but but and so you're giving people information they are wherever
*  however scooping their error into a more acceptable range and so they're letting their overestimations
*  and their underestimations they're raining that in and they're not letting that sort of spill across
*  the the the the next 10 20 second estimations so fractals default and expertise overcomes
*  fractality it can depending on the test so if the task needs you to to rein in your error and not let
*  it slip and slide across the the sort of the the terrain then yes and so when people are standing
*  still with their eyes closed more multi-fract so more variety and fractality is actually correlated
*  with more more multi-factality is correlated with more standard deviation of center of posture
*  and so you're getting less stable sway you're getting wobbly or sway with more multi and when
*  you open your eyes and you're looking ahead at a point on the wall you're suddenly doing a different
*  thing and fractal structure the the same multi-factality actually goes in the reverse
*  direction when you change the task and someone is using their visual system to latch on to to
*  this to something out in the world then multi-fractality actually stabilizes sway so like
*  wait so wait what sorry so so so wait what distinguish multi-fractality from what would be the
*  opposite of that unit fractality monofractal okay yeah yeah so i think you mentioned it briefly but
*  it's different levels but could yeah could you just describe it for the listeners so
*  monofractality is sort of is exactly what i was saying before about how you have one cosine and
*  you estimate a dimension for the whole thing yeah multi-fractality is saying well let's look at all
*  these different regions here here here here here here and here and we're going to get slightly
*  different ones and and so the debate a debate not a very heated or exciting debate for a lot of folks
*  but is our is the variation that you get in those is that a normal distribution like you would expect
*  from the linear model saying yeah just sort of unsystematic noise or is that variety suggestive
*  of non-linear interactions and so so so if we just take if we just sort of scoot aside from that and
*  say the variety is due to non-linear interactions and you get this this sort of variety in how
*  fractal you are at all at in all of your behaviors so okay so this is an important reason to care
*  when behavior goes from monofractal like giva and ordan liked to non-fractal just 0.5 hearst uncorrelated
*  that was that was the first 10 years of my argument trying to like get people to understand
*  like okay you're not just one thing there's variation and that's and so and so that's the
*  first way to understand multi-fractality your capacity to vary is potentially very important
*  and it's not just all fractal or all white noise it's like it's a it's a big it's it's a more
*  patterned landscape and then that's what you consider a swarm
*  or am i am i bringing that in at the wrong time because because you i would say a swarm is a kind
*  of cascade process where you have the i mean actually pearson when he was coming up with it
*  what so the the story i've heard is that he was he was actually trying to understand mosquito swarms
*  and he framed it in terms of the drunkard walk instead to talk about the independent
*  direction changes so the swarm i i think that's so so that for me would be a case where you have
*  this aggregation that can spread apart and and coalesce in interesting ways i should i shouldn't
*  have thrown that that wrench in there getting a soft topic but yeah you were saying that there's
*  that the debate the current debate that you think no one is interested oh no let's talk about that
*  right no less um no so so i was just actually scooting that aside and saying we have oh we have
*  sort of this idea that you can get different fractal dimensions on different parts of that
*  coastline okay and so what i was saying is like let's sort of so so that there's there's an
*  honest question about like does anyone need to care about that and and and so and so inside that one
*  inside that question was me for the first 10 years of my fractal work i would say on average saying
*  look we can be fractal we could be pink noise we could be white noise we can do all of these
*  things there's sort of we can contain many many many variations of this it's not a one or another
*  thing let's not that so okay so and so when people engaged in sort of card sort task gear system task
*  temporal estimation task they they they would show as they're doing more sort of like exploratory
*  kind of freewheel and stuff and learning the task more fractality was helpful as they grasp the task
*  so they're hyperly diffusing through the task space perhaps i mean these are all sort of like
*  schematic ways of thinking about but then as people latch down on the rules and figure out mastery and
*  figure and sort of get good they actually can scoop their their error into what looks more like
*  white noise what looks uncorrelated and so the very my my first sort of like step into multifractality
*  was like me trying to say no it's not like the sky has not fallen sometimes we're white noise
*  sometimes we're fractals sometimes like we can be all these things and it might matter to help
*  us understand what sort of perception action system we're being so there's a capacity for
*  fractality and as we move through the world we are also exploring that space and it may
*  help us in certain contexts and hinder us in others yeah so in the postural so so when i was
*  talking about the postural case i was saying like you can just look at a center of pressure time
*  series some of the most boring research out there i know but standing still is not like you can't
*  stand still you wobble and the wobble has structure and and one of one so in terms of like linear
*  description the thing you need for linear models like clear description is ergodicity
*  and so for you got to find that you got to find that term i know that's fine so in order to have
*  so standing still seems like the most simple stable thing that you could imagine linear models
*  require just that they require all of their variables all of the dvs to have an ergodicity
*  to them they have to have stable averages in some sense it's the same point about the wind having a
*  velocity you have to have some sort of representativity across the it's you know the problem of like
*  generalizability actually how how can you can you say that this sample as you as you measure a system
*  can you say that this sample that you've taken of this single system is can you take an average of
*  that is it stable enough to that that average is then important and then can be pooled with other
*  averages from other people and then god forbid could you take all those sample averages and then
*  predict to another person not in the sample like that's the clinical diagnosis problem
*  and then it's the whole generalizability problem like what does the individual person mean to in
*  light of any of this work that we do in the linear model the linear model requires that all these
*  averages are kosher they are stable that these these they that the mean can represent pun intended
*  pun intended can represent
*  the ongoing process and so the lit so the linear model needs that
*  even when you're standing still back to that boring example when it seems like you should be the
*  simplest case of ergodic measures you should be able to take center of pressure and we're not
*  going anywhere so it seems intuitively that should be like the simplest most stable thing and we can't
*  even like it's not so the models of raw postural sway you linear models would be nice you can't
*  put them on you can't train them on that without something better something good and you can't make
*  a predictor and put it inside your linear model and say i want to know how much like what what the
*  unique effect of that is that unique effect that you estimate with your interpretable linear model
*  that hinges on it being a representative sample of that predictor that you put in there
*  and if and so so so in in a sense i mean the sort of all the old challenges with sort of the computer
*  model all stand as far as i know but the new one that i like bringing up is this idea that like
*  take the simplest most stable behavior you think we have that like you know you want to have an
*  internal model of how upright am i you're like you want you cannot have a system that is operating
*  on that raw variation that's just not it's either the internal model isn't linear or the models we
*  make shouldn't be linear i mean there's a there's a there's a there's an incapacity of linear models
*  to to represent what isn't actually statistically mathematically ergodic but does that mean
*  that we have less purchase on an explanation if we're using a linear model as a descriptor
*  well it means you have less purchase if you're shoving non-ergodic things into it okay which
*  very often lots of folks are yeah the good news is that i mean so when when so cascades very very
*  non-ergodic the good news is that when you use these geometries that are made for cascades those
*  estimates are actually ergodic you can make the ergodic description and so in a sense it sort of
*  inoculates the linear model against all the problems originally and so i would you know there's
*  nothing i the linear model i mean in terms of like understanding how stuff works having discourse
*  linear model is is here to stay we're we're using it to discuss we have to know how to fit it and
*  we just need to know like how can we how can we generalize so so i i take heart in the fact that
*  you know one beyond any sort of theoretical thing like at least it's these multifactual
*  estimates are behaving there are ways of describing ergodicity breaking parts of us
*  and they're describing them in ergodic ways that submit to puzzle modeling in the in the old
*  traditional linear framework so so so so what they're describing is this what what these things
*  can describe or the is the variation in fractal dimensions so the that that capacity to vary from
*  pink noise to white noise so it's a so as so if you give the modeled information about how much
*  can this vary then that is actually less troubling because of ergodicity and it's potentially
*  predicting outcome i mean so one of the big problems with ecological psychology and a body
*  cognition is like the the body is contributing and i don't there's not a whole lot of purchase
*  for saying how like what part of movement and like what what do you mean wait what yeah what do you
*  describe that more well so when when you when you so okay so so the take ecological psychology
*  there is there when when when you talk about perception action they're talking about the
*  detection of information and it's invariantly specified so don't worry just just go with the
*  flow you don't have to look i mean in some sense you don't have to learn you don't have to learn
*  anything and and so that's why it's been strange for people to talk and interesting i like it
*  strange for for people to talk about direct learning the detection of non-specifying variables
*  and then just sort of also ways of thinking about affordance and information that's more
*  like transactionalist and less sort of like dispositional it's like
*  tervey would have said that the information is out there and for me that just sort of turns the
*  whole problem inside out instead of like an intelligence executive you made an intelligent
*  universe and you're done but so this so in terms so so so what i'm saying is that the ecological
*  approach has an idea that we do something about our bodily movement we reach out for information
*  and it's never been all that clear how that contributes because everyone's going to reach
*  out in a different way it's all it's going to be non-argotic it's going to be idiosyncratic
*  so what i'm trying to do with multifractal structure is come up with an ergodic description
*  that fits a linear model that sort of aims to say here here are these organisms non-linear
*  interactivities so i think that what what we're doing is we're we're we're trying to
*  quantify and make modelable both the behaviors we're looking to explain on the dv side and we're
*  also coming up with measures that will behave and go in a linear model that that can address how
*  how organisms do behaviors that produce or contribute to new information because this is
*  this is the that that latter part is what i don't see very much of elsewhere like so people will
*  talk embodiment they have they they've heard about that stuff they there's sort of imagery
*  and motor resonance with you know if you see people moving in a certain way your brain will
*  act activate in a certain way as if you were doing that there's all this really cool stuff but there's
*  no like then then it sort of drops off and the body is doing who knows what oh so okay so i'm so
*  with the turbulence and the multifractality i'm trying to sort of say like though the the turbulent
*  stuff that we do with our body in between stimulus to thought that sort of fills in some of those gaps
*  for embodied cognition that's that's what we can capture we can quantify with multi-fractal okay
*  okay so then zooming way out again right so you know fractality the coastline example is always
*  given coastline is not alive the coastline is not intelligent so fractals are everywhere right and
*  i mean not not everywhere everywhere but lots of natural structure that has no agency no intelligence
*  can be described as multifractal probably right sure and so then what is uh this is not a criticism
*  no there's no there is no there's no simple i mean just like there's no simple sort of like fractals
*  good fractals bad there's no simple fractal is intelligent fractal is not intelligent like i
*  don't i've never aimed for for that and i don't encourage it um there is there's sort of the i
*  mean so in i think that where it makes some sense is taking that zooming out as you said
*  you zooming out to the scale of these organisms and these brains came from somewhere
*  where you have an evolutionary process unfolding in a structured terrain of some sort um the
*  gibsonian idea and he wasn't saying all of this in exactly these terms so you sort of have to
*  varnish it and maybe see another glint of light in it but you the all the intelligence that we have
*  is thanks to our participation and our growth from these cascades and those cascades happened
*  in a patterned world and all those ambient arrays um those have structure that we are responding to
*  and i don't i mean i guess my problem has never been sort of like who's the intelligent one
*  which which is the intelligence i just sort of i agree that we are intelligent you and me and all
*  those other humans out there and we're trying to figure out where did that come from and some of
*  it did come from the environment and some of this environment was did have self-organizing systems
*  and some of those self-organizing systems could you know talk and some of that talking was
*  self-organizing too um so i don't i guess i don't think of it as sort of like an ex
*  i'm not looking to exclude someone from a club of intelligence i'm more trying to understand this
*  intelligent thing we're doing how did we get to it and what's if it's self-organizing what is the
*  language of self-organizing systems and can we play it out here it's not to make i mean it's
*  not animism i'm not trying to make you know coastlines live and speak and breathe i wasn't i
*  wasn't trying to pin that on no no i know but but i think it's it's a risk obviously because you can't
*  because you can't make the simple fractal is intelligent like that's and but it but i don't
*  think that's a i wouldn't pursue that at all i would say that when you have it so i would want
*  to i mean so the the arthropods that michael levin made they're not i mean people would debate
*  whether they're alive they were are they fractal i i would love to know it um i i would bet i mean i
*  bet that they i bet that their performance their their growth and their performance rests on
*  cascades that i'm sure we could model and understand sort of different outcomes and
*  different performance using multifactored geometry
*  so yeah so i think that multifractal is not sort of like a halo it's just it is it is a way to talk
*  about these it's a way to operationalize the cascades that we think got us here and that
*  we think are going to take us to the next chosen experimental point in other words you don't feel
*  like your entire career has been a waste just kidding no no no that was a joke it's okay
*  yeah because i mean i wonder man okay uh damian last thing what are you what are you doing right
*  now that's exciting what can we look forward to uh in the near future um so i'm working on
*  some more problem solving some more memory stuff so i've been doing a lot of posture
*  and that's been cool and that's sort of but but i want to sort of get out of it for a little
*  while and get back to some cognitive stuff which i feel like is where what got me into this in the
*  first place so right yeah i just reflect on that for a second like so you said like you were at
*  the very beginning you said you did everything wrong or you messed up when you know getting
*  into grad school or something and and i i didn't know exactly what you meant um and it's hard for
*  me to reflect on my own sort of changing evolving vantage you know viewpoint of what brains do and
*  what they are and what mind is and all that stuff i mean do you have a sense of that that you know
*  so so when i got into neuroscience i was interested in figuring out consciousness you know whatever
*  that means right and then as you uh go further along in your professional life you start to
*  work on very specific smaller problems and then when you work on that quote-unquote smaller problem
*  it gives rise to a bunch of other very specific very small problems right and so you become
*  narrower and narrower and narrower and what you just said is that like that's the reason you got
*  into this in the first place you know because you're interested in the cognition so how do you view
*  your own trajectory i actually feel like i feel like i i get these echoes back from the past when
*  i like read old books or see things that i said to people but like so someone someone saw my
*  turning paper and he pulled me aside and said do you know do you know kabbalah i was like yes i do
*  so for those of you who don't know this is a mystic uh mystic tradition in in judaism and so
*  some of the patterns in the turing patterns were like pentagram like shaped and so he was like you
*  know he hit this this rang rang a bell for him from something else and so way back before i got
*  into any of the stuff i was interested in carl young i was interested in archetypes and i wanted
*  to know where do these patterns come from why do we keep seeing these patterns similarly and so like
*  there's so i sort of dipped my toe into the joseph campbell stuff and like and so i but i wanted to
*  know how do i how do how does this have any leverage like is there anything that physics has about you
*  know self-organization so is is there any reason that this could happen and is there any reason
*  that that sort of suffuses goes through some of our you know psychological cognitive experience so
*  in a sense i feel like i'm still you know i'm doing exactly what i want to be doing
*  and answering very old questions i mean you know for yeah so so that's so i'm pretty pretty happy
*  with how things have turned out i would say um and i hope to keep going good well i hope we didn't
*  confuse uh many of our listeners i i'm sure a lot of people are very confused right now but uh i will
*  go ahead i'm available for contact and clarifying any questions anyone has there you go and yeah i'll
*  point to plenty of your work in the show notes as well so damian thanks for coming on i really
*  have enjoyed the conversation i'm going to see fractals everywhere i go today now so thanks
