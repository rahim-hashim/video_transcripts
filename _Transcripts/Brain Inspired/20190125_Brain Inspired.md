# BI 025 John Krakauer: Understanding Cognition
**Brain Inspired:** [January 25, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm5xmlk0OJE)
*  There just happens to be a techno fetishism that happens when technology is doing impressive
*  things that it becomes the new God.
*  And I think we have to be very cautious about that.
*  I can't open a wine bottle, I can't parallel park, I don't know my left and right, I can't
*  cook.
*  I'm actually a kind of bundle of failures that have led me to actually do this one thing.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hello current and future thought leaders.
*  I am Paul Middlebrooks.
*  Thanks for joining me here.
*  Today my guest is John Krakauer, who, despite what you just heard him say, is talented at
*  many things, including making your world better today by spending so much time talking with
*  me.
*  He is a neuroscientist and a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University, but we get to all
*  of that in just a minute.
*  I actually lucked out and got to have a beer with John in Madrid, New Mexico, of all places,
*  over the holidays recently.
*  He happened to be near Santa Fe, visiting his brother David, who is president of the
*  Santa Fe Institute, where they study the science of complexity.
*  And I happened to be in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
*  And one blizzardy night, I snuck away from my family and joined him at the Mineshaft,
*  the only restaurant slash bar open in Madrid.
*  I was repeatedly warned not to drink the water, as if it were old Mexico there, and so we
*  happily drank the beer instead.
*  Obviously we didn't record the podcast that evening, but a few weeks later.
*  This is a long episode, because John was generous with his time, and it is in keeping with his
*  outlook that science should proceed carefully and thoughtfully.
*  I think this is going to be a real treat for you.
*  We talk about John's perspective paper from last year that pushes the idea that we need
*  to focus more on behavior to understand what our brains are actually doing.
*  That is a very simplified summary, and you'll hear John flesh out his and his co-author's
*  thoughts on this a lot more.
*  But we go way beyond science here, too, and talk about broader topics like philosophy,
*  what it even means to understand something, and John offers tons of useful nuggets that
*  I know you'll appreciate and continue to think about moving forward.
*  I love the direction that this episode takes, and I want to try more episodes like this
*  in the future.
*  There are a ton of show notes in this one, lots of links to the millions of books that
*  John mentions, so be sure to check out the show notes at braininspired.co slash podcast
*  slash 25.
*  If you like this show, please consider supporting it on Patreon.
*  Go to the homepage, braininspired.co, and find the red Patreon button there, and you

*  A teensy tiny amount.
*  Thanks this week to Daniel, Sebastian, and Sean.
*  Thank you guys, and thanks to my other supporters.
*  It makes me eager to keep bringing you excellent people like this guy.
*  John Krakauer, welcome to the show, and thanks for joining me.
*  Thank you for inviting me.
*  So I will have introduced you a bit more before we're talking here, but you are a neurologist
*  and a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University, where among other many things, you run the
*  BLAM lab, the Brain, Learning, Animation, and Movement lab, and you work on all sorts
*  of movement related research like motor control, motor learning, in your neurology work, you
*  work on recovery after stroke, you produce interactive video games of dolphins that people
*  can control, bringing them back to their childhood so that they can help repair their brain regions
*  after a stroke.
*  That might be interesting to talk about if we have time for it.
*  You've recently published a book called Broken Movement, the Neurobiology of Motor Recovery
*  After Stroke, which is an MIT press.
*  But lately, you've been exercising your philosophical bent as well.
*  And I know that you have a new book coming up.
*  And just before we spoke, you said today you're working on that book a little bit.
*  Can you just tell us a little bit about it?
*  Yes.
*  So last February, in 2017, a paper came out that I wrote with colleagues about a sort
*  of a mildly philosophical paper on the role of behavior and understanding in neuroscience,
*  which led to a lot of interest.
*  And some people read it and thought it could be made into a book.
*  I wasn't really interested in sort of just revisiting that topic.
*  But then with my good friend and co-author Asif Ghazanfar, professor of neuroscience
*  at Princeton, he and I had always been interested in writing a book or we are interested in
*  books in general.
*  He's reviewed books for TLS and other places.
*  So we thought why not we could actually do what we've always wanted to do, which is work
*  together, write a book.
*  And here we are being asked to do so.
*  And so we said yes.
*  And you know, it's still in its early stages.
*  The working title right now is What is Neuroscience Thinking?
*  And we are still trying to work out its exact structure and what the core arguments will be.
*  But it's beginning to crystallize.
*  Well, that's good because we're going to talk a lot about that paper, that perspective that
*  you wrote with David.
*  Is it Popple or Popple?
*  Popple, yeah.
*  He was one of the five authors.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah, multiple other authors.
*  So people will have a seed to think about.
*  So when the book comes out, they'll get to go and buy the book and this will be a good
*  reaction, hopefully, for that.
*  Yes, yes.
*  So can we talk just a few minutes about just the act of writing?
*  Because you know, a lot of academics write books and a lot of academics are really busy.
*  Can we talk just about writing in general, the process and juggling, you know, how to
*  juggle it with your academic work and so on?
*  Right.
*  So I think there are a number of issues here.
*  I think, first of all, writing books is not the norm, as you know, as an academic unit
*  in the sciences.
*  In other words, papers are.
*  So yes, scientists can write popular science books and we can get to that in a minute.
*  But in general, unlike in the humanities, where you basically make or break your career
*  based on the books you've written, that's not true in the sciences.
*  Now writing can apply to anything.
*  You can write an abstract for society, for neuroscience, you can write a paper.
*  But I think writing is long form thought.
*  And I think long form thought, the essay, the review article, the book, isn't something
*  that you get trained to do very well in scientific training.
*  And along with a good friend of mine, he's an astrophysicist at Hopkins, Brice Menard.
*  You know, we've talked about how books are sort of multi-scale objects, right?
*  You have the word, the sentence, the paragraph, the page, the chapter, the whole book.
*  So it has multiple scales.
*  And therefore you have to think on multiple scales.
*  So I would say that essays and books change the way you think.
*  They transform your subject in the act of having to write, is my view.
*  I certainly found that to be the case when I wrote the stroke book, that I rediscovered
*  the subject and had a different feel for it in the very act of writing the book and
*  having to synthesize all that information.
*  And in fact, I have friends in the stroke recovery field who said that they noticed
*  a change in the way that I presented the material at meetings that they attributed to what happened
*  to me when I wrote the book.
*  So that's one thing.
*  But as to your other question, can you find the time to write them?
*  Very difficult.
*  In other words, you have to have a kind of setup, whether it's your chair, whether you've
*  managed to do it for yourself to write.
*  I know people who have written, I remember Jack Martin, a neuroscientist in New York,
*  who wrote a neuroanatomy textbook.
*  And he would get up at four in the morning every day to write it.
*  I had two inspirations.
*  Hopkins has a very famous neuro-ophthalmologist called David Zee, who along with his friend
*  John Lee wrote the definitive textbook on the neurology of eye movement, which is now
*  in its fifth edition and is a classic.
*  And so that was a big inspiration.
*  And then Reza Shadman, who is a professor of neuroscience at Hopkins, has also written
*  a couple of books on motor control.
*  I think that it was also an inspiration.
*  But these are not the norm.
*  But I consider both of them intellectuals.
*  And I think that we need a little bit more intellectualism to come back, especially into
*  neuroscience.
*  And one way that maybe it would happen automatically is if people got back to long-form thinking.
*  Both those points.
*  I have something to say.
*  So time-wise, I've been reading this book called, I think it's called Daily Rituals.
*  I'll have to look it up to make sure.
*  But it's just an account of a bunch of different authors, famous writers, artists, musicians,
*  sort of how they spent their day, like when they worked and what they did.
*  And it's really frustrating because so many of them were otherwise unemployed or were
*  benefactors of someone else's money.
*  And just they'd wake up and smoke in bed for three hours without anyone speaking to them.
*  And then they'd go on a five-hour walk.
*  And then they'd go to a pub.
*  And then they'd come back and think for another hour.
*  So it's like they have all of this time and academics don't have that time.
*  So you really have to be disciplined.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, what I find is that in order for me to write, I need to have the whole day free
*  and then find the hour that will jump on me and go, this is the hour.
*  For example, last night I finished writing a paper, which I just couldn't muster the
*  willpower to write.
*  Then suddenly I had the desire to write it at around 11 o'clock at night and it just
*  came out of my fingers.
*  There are so many examples of what you're saying.
*  Emanuel Kant never left Konigsberg and people could set their clocks by the walk that he
*  would take around the city.
*  Darwin, who wrote 20 odd books, basically because of wealth and Chagas disease, lived
*  in the countryside and an incredible wife and wrote and wrote and wrote.
*  So yes, writing and doing things slowly and deeply is out of fashion.
*  There's no time for it.
*  Well, there's no time because we've.
*  Scheduled and PowerPointed our way out of our own thinking, right?
*  In other words, it's.
*  You know, when you count them as thinking fast and slow, it's now it should really be
*  called thinking fast and faster.
*  Nice.
*  Well, the other thing that you said is that the act of writing actually helped you think
*  through things and revisit them in a new light.
*  And a lot of famous authors have suggested that as well in fiction and nonfiction, that
*  you really don't know that writing is an act of thinking and hashing out the way that you
*  think about a subject.
*  So I think that's just interesting that you say that.
*  I agree that it's a super valuable and frustrating endeavor.
*  Yes, yes.
*  And of course, all writers are readers.
*  So in other words, not only do you have to find the time to write yourself, but in
*  preparation and in parallel, you have to read a lot yourself.
*  And I mean, I just don't know how many people find the time to regularly imbibe large
*  chunks of book, you know.
*  Yeah, right.
*  And variety, not just.
*  Yes, yes.
*  And, you know, and again, that final point on that is creative scientists.
*  I mean, Dean Simonton has looked at this tend to be very interested in the arts and
*  they're not just writing, reading science books.
*  They're they're they're reading novels.
*  They're they're reading history.
*  They're reading philosophy.
*  Einstein is a big reader.
*  Niels Bohr was a big reader.
*  So it's it's a lot of time.
*  Yeah, time well spent.
*  Is there any part of you that wishes that you had chosen to be an author or, you know,
*  strictly and gone more down that road than the science road?
*  I know it's really rewarding what you do.
*  I I don't think so in so much that what you write about is about what you've done, but I
*  must admit there's a part of me thinking down the line that I might be more interested in
*  the history and philosophy of science, you know, HPS.
*  Yeah.
*  And it does interest me.
*  And we can talk maybe a little bit more about philosophy and history and how important the
*  art of science later if you want to know you want to bring that up.
*  But yes, it has occurred to me.
*  Well, it's interesting reading just reading your perspective that we're going to get to in a few
*  minutes here and and then going down the rabbit hole and reading some of the references with that
*  are historically philosophical, you know, the philosophy of science and history of science
*  oriented. It's really opened up sort of that philosophical way of thinking to me again that I
*  had kind of lost in my specialization in graduate school and as you know, doing a postdoc.
*  I started off interested in philosophy and that's really what got me into neuroscience.
*  And then you get really specialized and it sort of it can really take you out of the
*  philosophical way of thinking.
*  So but yeah, so we'll get to that.
*  Yeah, because you've actually said the key notions, in other words, people have written about
*  this specialization and philosophical contemplation are in fact in conflict with each other.
*  And that is one of the key reasons to make a case for philosophy is that it's a counterbalance to
*  forced specialization.
*  But we can talk about that.
*  Yeah. Well, OK.
*  So your brother is David Krakauer and he's the president of the Santa Fe Institute where they
*  study complexity science.
*  And a few episodes ago, I interviewed Melanie Mitchell, who's an external faculty.
*  And hopefully I'll get to interview your brother sometime soon.
*  And you guys actually co-authored, I guess you'd say, this nice paper in current biology.
*  And by the way, I just got my most recent manuscript just got rejected from Nature
*  immediately. So now it's in review at Current Biology.
*  Nice little nice little journal.
*  So I think it's my favorite journal, actually, because it's so ecumenical with respect to
*  creatures. It loves all the animals.
*  That's really true. Yeah, that's a good point.
*  Anyway, I hear David's a terrible brother and I'm sorry to hear it.
*  Yes.
*  So you guys you guys seem pretty close.
*  Not all brothers are. So is there any any competitive streak between you?
*  I think we went from indifference towards each other to towards complete sort of friendship and
*  overlap without really much competition in between, I would say.
*  What age was that? What age did that happen?
*  I think I think I can tell you, I think, you know, I was always the good student in school
*  and he was always slightly sort of less interested, you know, the older younger brother syndrome.
*  And then I think what happened is that when I when we sort of stopped, you know, I went to
*  Cambridge and then he a few years later went to University of London and then I moved to the United
*  States and he began to develop his own interests in computer science and evolutionary biology.
*  I think in my absence, he overtook me basically.
*  And yeah, and then and then he and then he finally moved back to the United States.
*  He went to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and then from there he went to
*  the Santa Fe Institute where he basically stayed ever since except a short sojourn
*  at the University of Wisconsin. And I think throughout that time,
*  we kept talking about books in general and about science. And I think in a way,
*  he was the one that made me realize I wanted to be more of a full-time scientist than a physician.
*  I think he was the one through our conversations said, John, you started in science, then you went
*  into medicine, then you went back into research. And I think that's where you belong because you
*  keep asking these kind of questions. And we were just talking the other day, and it's come all the
*  way to the point where he says, John, basically, you're a complexity scientist. Okay.
*  And he actually reminds me of a letter where he wrote to me saying that there were abstract
*  ways of thinking about science that moved above the particular specialty or medium.
*  And I apparently disagreed with him back then. But now I'm in full agreement.
*  So I think we're just now fellow book readers and fellow complexity scientists. It's just that he
*  knows more about complexity than I do. I was going to ask you how much complexity science really
*  has shaped and continues to shape the way that you think and approach your work.
*  So I will talk about that too. I would say increasingly so.
*  Yeah. Yeah, because I talked to David yesterday and he said he's perpetually disappointed with
*  you. I just thought I'd let you know. Did you really talk with him?
*  No, of course not. Okay.
*  I'm trying to rile you guys up though. Maybe I can get you guys in a heated competition.
*  Okay. Well, let's talk about this paper. So this perspective that you wrote with David Popple and
*  a bunch of other co-authors as well called Neuroscience Needs Behavior, Correcting a Reductionist
*  Bias. So John, you son of a bitch, why do you hate neurons and technology so much?
*  Yeah. Well, I don't. I'm not going to fall into that trap. I'm not a Luddite. I mean,
*  as you know, we've developed video games, we have robotics, we do brain stimulation,
*  functional imaging. So I'm far from somebody who shuns technology. Although I do believe that you
*  can do deep things with simple behavioral experiments. In other words, I think amongst
*  my friends who do psychophysics, I think it never ceases to amaze us that you can actually
*  make quite deep discoveries with fairly simple experiments. So and sometimes I've had people
*  say to me, you know, why are you doing it? It looks so sort of late 19th century, early 20th century.
*  But I do think that you can still do interesting experiments without having to have vast outlays
*  in technology. But anyway, I think the question is sort of a deep one. I mean, I do believe that
*  that we are entering an era where sort of the industrialization of science, as some have called
*  it, is happening, where the combination of technology and big data seem to be the new model
*  for how to do science. And I think that it's getting in the way of good old hypothesis based
*  conceptual science. And what you see, for example, with the, you know, the brain project at the NIH
*  is that they literally kind of say that the thinking can come later, will let the theorists
*  get their hands on the data, but let's just collect as much of it as we can. And all I think
*  is going to happen is you're just going to have this mismatch between facts without the ability
*  to turn them into knowledge, because of a theoretical gap. And that is basically, I mean,
*  that's why the paper was sort of got had the bias word in it. It's not that one is sort of trying
*  to simply substitute one thing for another monolithic thing. It's just, there just happens
*  to be a techno fetishism that happens when technology is doing impressive things, that it
*  becomes the new God. And I think we have to be very cautious about that. We'll get deeper into
*  the entirety of the article here, but there is quite a reaction to it. So it's been covered in
*  a lot of places, like, you know, it's been written about in things like Scientific American,
*  in the Atlantic, a bunch of other places. But I know, and those were mostly positive,
*  supportive reactions. And I know that you've had backlash as well. So what reactions have you had
*  from this paper and maybe even continue to have? Yeah, I mean, I have to admit, you know, this
*  paper took about two and a half years to write. It has an interesting history of its own. It all
*  started with the Gordon Conference, where some editors at a journal sort of suggested that I
*  write something based on the style of a talk that I gave. And then at that meeting, David Popple,
*  who I had not known before then, sort of whisked me off in his convertible to have a coffee saying
*  that I was wonderful. And we have to be friends forever, BFFs. And this was the sort of the
*  beginnings of this paper. And we wrote it. And many people read it along the way. And then the
*  week that it came out, I remember it was February the 8th, 2017, was the week that I had to get my
*  manuscript into MIT Press for the Broken Movement book. Otherwise, it would not be out of time for
*  SFN. So I my mind was elsewhere. And then suddenly, my Twitter feed, my email, my Facebook
*  jammed. Yeah, I was just like, it was what was going on. You know, it was a little bit like what
*  happened when the New Yorker profiled me a few years before. No, it was just lots and lots of
*  traffic. And that traffic continued and continued. And I had no, I had not thought that it would
*  generate this degree of interest. I really didn't. So all I can say is I think it came at the right
*  time. It was latent in the zeitgeist. Many people, especially the young, I think grad students and
*  postdocs did feel they were selling a little bit of being sold a bill of goods by their neuroscience
*  departments that, you know, just get a technique, pick an animal model, and just generate data,
*  right, and jump on the conveyor belt and keep your head down and don't think too much. And so I got a
*  lot of very positive responses from the young, like saying, you know, thank God you kind of called
*  that the emperor has no clothes, that you're going against the orthodoxy. So lots of that.
*  And then from many psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, very positive response.
*  And some of the hardcore neuroscientists were not unpleasant, but you know, Tony Zeta sort of had a
*  whole Twitter stream about it. And then it basically boiled down to saying, you know, it's all a matter
*  of taste, and that some people are more interested in mechanism than others, with the word mechanism
*  being synonymous with you've got to be touching, licking, kissing a neuron. And of course, which
*  was exactly what we were refuting in that paper. So I would say that my contemporaries in more
*  reductionist neuroscience were less than pleased, but I never got, I didn't get attacked, they're
*  probably just in their silence or just cursed amongst themselves. But in terms of what I actually
*  received, it was very positive. Yeah, good. Yeah, overall. And there was one, I'm trying to
*  forget, remember his name, he's a scientist at the University of Nottingham in England, and he has a
*  very good blog. And I really like him, actually, I haven't met him. But he wrote a slightly, oh,
*  we've heard all this before. This gets recycled periodically, and was, I think, a little dismissive.
*  So that was published. The Spike, I think it's called, the blog. Oh, Mark Humphries?
*  Mark Humphries. Yeah, he's been on the podcast, a delightful fellow. Yeah, Mark. So he wrote
*  something slightly, and I've always wanted the opportunity to sort of discuss it with him. But
*  his was a little bit smarmy, I thought. Yeah, no, I actually thought about him when I was,
*  just this morning when I was reading some of your work. And so that's interesting. I didn't
*  realize that he had written that piece. Yes, he had. Yeah. Lately, something I've really
*  appreciated interviewing the past couple months is, I just, I think it's wonderful how texts that
*  are 50, 60, 70 years old are being revisited in light of our modern knowledge and technological
*  abilities. And it's like, I can't help but wonder if this is a, like a law of scientific progress,
*  that we always cycle back to this kind of older work. So I interviewed Matt Botvinick, and he
*  bases a lot of his work on experiments done by Harry Harlow in like 1949, in the 40s. I just
*  interviewed Tim Behrens, who, you know, he harkens back to Edward Tolman with the concept of cognitive
*  maps. And then here I'm talking with you. And in your paper, you guys reference Nicholas
*  Tenvergen's work in the 50s and 60s, his work on behavior and ethology and his four questions
*  needed to explain phenomena. It'd be neat to work out the rate and the distribution of how far back
*  we look as we move forward. Maybe there's some sort of power law to describe this relationship.
*  So I'm wondering, it made me think just in a day-to-day basis, how much we've progressed in
*  terms of approaching how we conceive of intelligence and cognition and our own cognitive abilities.
*  Like when a scientist sits down and thinks about human cognition these days, how much does it
*  differ from an analog of that same scientist maybe 100,000 years ago, let's say, not in terms of the
*  knowledge that we've gained about the brain, but in terms of how we feel about what intelligence is,
*  what we think intelligence and cognition and consciousness is. Do you think that's changed
*  much? Does that even make sense? Well, no, it does make sense. I mean, my brother's very
*  interested in this more general notion of intelligence. And Matt Botvinick feels, I think,
*  that what they're trying to do at DeepMind is to understand intelligence. And so they are willing
*  to both think about it in a superhuman way and also, of course, as humans being the best
*  example of it, learn from humans. But they're sort of agnostic about whether humans in their
*  biological form are the only manifestation of intelligence or will always be. So I think
*  intelligence is superordinate over humans in one way. On the other hand, because humans are our
*  best example of it, it's what we mean when we say cognition. In other words, cognitive neuroscience
*  and psychology are really human sciences, right? I think our folk psychological notions
*  have probably not changed. I think it'd be very arrogant to presume that we understand
*  how humans think better than Shakespeare did. Or even the Greeks did, or Jane Austen
*  didn't understand human psychology as well as we did. I think, of course, she did. So
*  from the standpoint of the material that we need to explain scientifically, I don't think
*  the material has changed very much. Yeah, you said folk psychology. That was the term that I was
*  missing in that. So that's exactly what I was talking about. And then, of course, the question
*  is, has folk psychology carved the cognitive space in a way that makes it worthwhile trying to go
*  after its components? Or should we not trust it? Because it's basically the psychological version
*  of phrenology, the division of the wrong, right? So then you get to sort of psychology and cognitive
*  neuroscience, where the idea is that the component processes are more validated. And those are the
*  pieces that we then have to get reductionist on. But overall, I think cognition, emotions,
*  and planning, and thinking, and we all have a sort of folk psychological feel about what those things
*  are. And I don't think it's changed that much. All right. Well, everyone is salivating at the thought
*  these days of ever more precise and sophisticated data being recorded. So the quality of the data,
*  and ever more reams of data being recorded. So the quantity of the data that we can record,
*  just as you were describing a few minutes ago, and the ability to perform these causal manipulations
*  to generate causal type explanations for our behaviors. But the contention of this paper
*  that we're talking about is that data is worthless without understanding the behaviors themselves
*  front. So why is behavior important? Yeah, so there is interesting the reception of this paper.
*  Some people thought the paper's main idea was that you need more naturalistic behaviors,
*  that you have to go and see these animals in the wild, or do your best to get them in the wild,
*  because otherwise, you know, you're going to be trying to eke out a non ecological behavior from
*  them. And it's just not. It's like using an iPhone as a hammer, you can do so. But that's not what it
*  evolved to do. I've done it. Yeah, right. Yeah. So that was one argument that we had. But the real
*  argument that we made was that the best way to sort of have algorithmic and computational level
*  theories about what might be going on is to go at it through behavior. In other words,
*  it was the way to get your component pieces to do theorizing with. Right. So it was much more that,
*  oh, you know, if I want to have, you know, like, for example, reinforcement learning is an entire
*  conceptual apparatus came from animal behavior. Right. I mean, people don't realize that, you know,
*  temporal difference learning and, you know, these computational approaches that are now used
*  all the time at places like deep mind started from animal behavior work. Right. So that was the main
*  point we're trying to make is that you do good behavioral analysis, you are it's going to be
*  theory generating. And then what you do is start looking at the implementation level of the
*  algorithmic computational ideas you have. But the but very much the idea was that you do that first.
*  It's very difficult to sort of reverse engineer or bottom up derive such ideas. I'm very
*  skeptical that something like temporal difference learning would have been derived by recording
*  from the basal ganglia. Right. It was an idea that was already in existence. And it was used
*  to interpret the famous work by Wolfram Schultz. Right. It was because we knew about this theoretical
*  framework that one could look at those data. Oh, that looks like a reward prediction error.
*  Right. So that was the main deep thrust, which is that most of the time, the theoretical conceptual
*  frameworks with which you then do neuroscience on come from the behavioral side, for the most part.
*  Okay, nice. For the most part. So I mean, this might be a good time to bring in
*  David Maher's levels of analysis, just to frame what we're going to talk about, because you have
*  a figure in the paper, it's figure four, for those of you following along at home. And it's
*  essentially shows where we are now with regard to our scientific progress in this arena, and where
*  we want to be. Do you think we should recap David Maher's levels of explanation and frame it that
*  way? Or do you think we should proceed a different way? Well, I mean, I think that I could imagine
*  certain people listening and sort of rolling their eyes, you know, here comes
*  Maher all over again. Yeah, I do think there are many ways that Maher has been
*  understood and misunderstood. I think that Maher very much came from the computational side.
*  Well, that's not true. He came from the lower mechanistic side and then realized the error.
*  Right, right. I'm saying that with his sort of equilibrium state, you know, the Maher we know,
*  right? So I think, you know, it was basically the idea like in that diagram that, you know, you have,
*  you know, the sort of the idea of flight, right, which is quite abstract. And it can apply to bats
*  and it can apply to birds and it can apply to planes. It can apply to flying squirrels,
*  right? And that's sort of the more computational idea of flying. And then there's sort of how do you
*  do it? And you know, well, if you have wings, you flap them. And then you can end up looking
*  down at the level of well, what, how do you build a wing? How does it be? How is it an object that
*  can be flapped? Therefore you solve the problem of flying, right? He had a famous line where he
*  sort of saying, you know, studying neurons to understand cognition or something like that is
*  as useful as studying feathers to understand flight, you know? And, you know, this has been,
*  I think on your podcast, Matt Botvinick likes to sort of say that birds were studied to understand
*  flight, but the general idea, I think, is true. And then it's had reincarnations that if you
*  want to understand your MATLAB code, you don't have to understand how the transistors in your computer
*  speak to your MATLAB code. It's irrelevant, right? Unless your computer breaks. So that, so
*  Ma was basically sort of getting at this idea of levels of understanding levels of realization,
*  you know, is psychology a field that will never be subsumed by neuroscience?
*  Are there effective theories at one level that don't require diving down below that level?
*  So it's all this family of discussions about, you know, then there's Phil Anderson's famous paper
*  of more is different. Also where he has a diagram that you've got psychology all the way down to
*  physics and that they're all independent disciplines and they all have their own
*  explanatory vocabulary. So it's all part of this general view that there is no privileged
*  level of explanation, that each question will have its favorite explanatory objects
*  and that to believe that we'll all reduce down to some privileged level, which will explain away
*  the levels above is the general reaction to the reductionist project. And he's the name that has
*  become the label for that counter reaction to what people see as reductionism.
*  Right. But the general principle, as you say, is that there are these different levels with which to
*  approach problems and understanding and that there are merits within each level. So
*  and people, and just to say, I do think people get confused because there are disciplines,
*  right? There's psychology, there's neuroscience, there's physics. There's an hierarchical
*  organization of a complex system. Right. So this is the point that Dana Ballard makes in his book
*  on brain computation as hierarchical abstraction, which is every complex system, you know,
*  echoing neural has a hierarchical structure. And one of the key features of hierarchical complex
*  systems is that the levels above omit details from the level below. Okay. So you've got the
*  disciplines, you have the hierarchical organization of complex systems where details are omitted as
*  you go up the level that is a essential feature of these systems, right? You do not have all the
*  details about transistors in your software. And then there's more computational algorithmic
*  and implementation and people get confused. That's true at every level, you can be Marion
*  at the level of dendrites, right? You can be Marion at the level of the history and science of the
*  action potential. So sometimes people think that computational level one means psychology and
*  implementation level three is circuit neuroscience. That's not what he meant at all.
*  No, but that's how you're framing it in this particular paper in terms of studying
*  neuroscience in general, right? So right now where we are is the bias, right, of where neuroscience is
*  mainly focused right now is studying the brain at the neuron level and the neuronal circuit level.
*  And that's the implementation level. That's the level one, level three of David Marr, let's say.
*  And where we want to be is understanding, which is the higher levels, the computation, what are these
*  processes giving rise to? What are the computations needed for the function of the behaving organism,
*  be it humans or any other animal? And that's at the behavioral level.
*  So yes, so it's very, very important to get this clear because I know how they sort of mesh,
*  but they are different, right? In other words, sometimes you can have your cake and eat it
*  for particular circumstances where you can get the implementational level and the sort of
*  computational algorithmic understanding sort of simultaneously.
*  I mean, the example I like to give is sort of David Robinson's study of saccadic eye movements,
*  where you can basically see the sort of causal sequence of events through neurons.
*  You can have a computational idea like the neural integrator, and then you can actually see the eye
*  movements themselves and you get this nice isomorphism between the implementational
*  algorithmic and computational levels. They all click into place.
*  Now, even there, some details are omitted, but there is a feeling that you're getting the full
*  shebang, right? The point we're trying to make is that the objects of understanding
*  will probably not be neuron A connected to neuron B connected to neuron C once you get to more
*  cognitive-like phenomena, right? So that's where behavior of, you know, when it comes more complex,
*  allows you to infer the explanatory objects that you're going to use, which are going to be more
*  abstract than neurons connected to each other, and then you can begin to theorize computationally
*  algorithmically. But understanding that you can be Marian even at the level of a circuit. I mean,
*  we're going back half a century, people have thought about neural circuits this way. Central
*  pattern generators, you know, the Brown's half center model is an abstraction, right? It's an
*  abstraction of how a central pattern generator works that doesn't have to think about all the
*  details and the types of neurons and their properties and interneuron types. You just
*  have the half center model. So even at the level of circuits, you abstract away the details and can
*  be David Marian, right? So I just want to make sure we don't collapse the Marian perspective,
*  and its usefulness as a tool to a hierarchy of disciplines and phenomena that look at first
*  blush to be equivalent, but they're actually not. No, it's a good I appreciate you making that point.
*  So let's just linger on psychotic eye movements for a minute, right? So you feel pretty comfortable
*  that you almost said you understand, but instead of you said, you know, the whole shebang.
*  Yeah, you know, just generating eye movements, right? But then as we go up the cognitive hierarchy,
*  that line blurs and then eventually disappears, right? So, you know, as soon as you start talking
*  about where to move your eyes, like making a decision what to attend to, when your arousal
*  is up, your pupils dilate, that changes the amount of light coming in your eyes. And so,
*  there's all these higher cognitive processes. So it begs the question, where is that line where we lose
*  explanatory power at the level of neurons and neural circuitry? I know that you don't know
*  the answer, but I have to think that you would imagine it's really low level.
*  Well, I mean, you know, I, David Robinson himself thought that going into cortex was too hard,
*  right? I remember a dinner in Germany with Carl Dysaroff, where he also thought
*  that cortex was hard, versus looking at sort of subcorded nuclei, brainstem, things like that.
*  So there's always been this feeling that mammalian cortex, in my view, the way I think about it is
*  you go from neurons as mechanism. In other words, and let me just be very clear about what I mean by
*  that. It's when you're talking about spatiotemporal structure. In other words, you're talking about the
*  physical instantiation of the circuitry, right? It's where they're localized in time and space,
*  like a stretch reflex, like a saccadic eye movement, where you can literally say, you know, the
*  hip bone is connected to the knee bone is connected to the ankle bone. Okay, right.
*  And then what happens is when you get to sort of cortex, neurons become not that kind of mechanism,
*  they become harbingers and evidence for functional ideas. Right? So neurons is evidence as
*  confirmation of theories versus neurons as the spatiotemporal physical instantiation of something.
*  And what my feeling is, is that when you start getting into cortex and cognition,
*  neurons just become another kind of evidence, they become just like behavior is evidence,
*  just like lesions are evidence. And I think people confuse neurons as another piece of evidence for
*  functional ideas with neurons as being the actual physical instantiation of the behavior
*  that you're interested in. And all we try to say in that paper, and I'm trying to say elsewhere,
*  is that if you think you can have neurons still have that isomorphic click like feeling that you
*  get for saccadic eye movements when it comes to cognition, it's just not going to happen.
*  But you're not completely closing the book on it. But that is your feeling. Is that do I have
*  you correct? Yes, I think I think I think that you will talk about populations of neurons,
*  you'll do dimensionality reduction on those populations of neurons and come up with objects
*  that you talk about. But they will be abstract objects that have been created out of neurons.
*  But it's those objects that you will create your theories with which you can then make yourself
*  understand something. In other words, you know, understanding a phenomena means that you have to
*  have a theory, fuzzy or mathematical, that is intelligible, that you can use to understand the
*  explanation of the phenomenon. This is a position put forward by a philosopher, very nicely direct
*  D E R E G T in Holland, where he talks about this. And the point I'm making is that the theory with
*  which a phenomenon becomes the explanation of phenomenon becomes understandable via the theory,
*  the objects out of which you construct that theory are more abstract and macroscopic than neurons
*  as you move towards cognition, which is exactly by the way what all the AI people say. Right,
*  they say that what we want to borrow from cognitive neurons and psychology, a sort of algorithmic and
*  computational theories of cognition. Matt Bofenic basically said on your program that, you know,
*  maybe one day neurons will matter if we worry about energetic efficiency. The entire project
*  at DeepMind is operating at that level. So I think it's understood ironically, by fields outside of
*  current circuit neuroscience, better than circuit neuroscience itself understands it.
*  Yeah, well, circuitry is hard enough to understand. So, you know, get a little bogged down and focused
*  and narrowly focused on what you're doing, I suppose. It's hard to keep the big picture in mind.
*  And as I said before, just, you know, whether it's a kind of eye movements, you end up coming up with
*  an abstraction even there, you say neural integrator, when it comes to CPG, you talk about
*  half center models, when it comes to the stretch reflex, you talk about reciprocal inhibition.
*  So even at the level of circuits, you end up coming up with an abstraction, you know,
*  Eve Marder's work in the Stomach of Gastric Ganglion, you know, you end up talking about
*  sort of a ratio required in inhibition and excitation that can be implemented in many ways.
*  Right. So even there, you're doing abstraction. So it's interesting, you mentioned, I guess,
*  as direct was his name, I'll have to look up the his definition of understanding, because there's
*  a lot of different definitions of understanding. You know, one is, we, what was it? Richard
*  Feynman, Richard Feynman on his chalkboard, when he died had written something to the effect of,
*  I don't understand what I can't build. So, and that's a common theme and understanding. So if
*  we can't build it, we don't understand it. Another theme is, if we can make a model of it,
*  that predicts everything that it does, then we understand it. So, but you're on board with
*  direct's definition of understanding. Yes. And also, I think Feynman, you know,
*  famously said that you had to have some intuitive physical understanding of the system without
*  having to go through the entire derivation again. I think he was inspired by Dirac saying something
*  just like that. So you need to develop skill in intuition, so that you can intuit the solutions
*  to the problems without having to go through the whole logical formalism over and over and over
*  again. In physics, there was always this tension between, ah, we're only going to be able to
*  describe and predict what's happening, we're not going to be able to understand it. In other words,
*  actually, direct have a beautiful chapter on the difference reception of Heisenberg's
*  matrix mechanics view of quantum mechanics and Schrodinger's wave mechanics view. And
*  basically, people couldn't understand the matrix mechanics, even though they accepted
*  that it could make predictions. But they preferred Schrodinger's wave mechanics,
*  because they could visualize it and think with it, and they could do more generalizable work with it.
*  So I would say that you do want to have understanding, and there will be cases where
*  you get prediction and you can build like a circuit or a dynamic network full of neurons,
*  but you don't understand what's going on. And the way you get understanding is you bunch some of
*  that into a bigger object, which you can then think with and you give it a name. Right? You say,
*  you say reward. Yeah, right. You say value, you say motivation. Right? You say error.
*  Right? Those words and error is a useful object to think with when you're thinking about learning
*  rules. You know, you don't go into the details of every single neuron that was required to compute
*  that error that you can then use in a computational model. So I would say that, yes, you can do
*  prediction and building and description. But if you want to do understanding and develop a theory
*  with which you can do intuitive work with, you're going to have to have objects that get bigger
*  as the system gets more complex. In some of your talks, you have, well, I guess you could say,
*  admitted to guilt in previously pursuing, you know, scientific questions from the lower level,
*  from the mechanistic level. And I'm not sure how accurate that really is. But I'm curious how,
*  how you personally came to, I think this is a really valuable approach. I think it's going to
*  benefit so many people who receive the message. And I'm just curious how you personally came to
*  this way of thinking and realizing that it is that more behavior that we need and to think about it
*  in terms of the sort of computational level. Anyway, I think it was more that I, I understood
*  because I was also a doctor that there are two flavors of neuroscience. There's fixing
*  neuroscience and there's understanding neuroscience. And I'm very interested in
*  fixing your sciences, you know, I've been involved in the development of mouse models of stroke.
*  And I'm very interested in trying to actually go in at the neural level and fix the brain. So it
*  is the correct level for fixing things. Right. And you can look at the history of neuroscience
*  as being sort of the history of neuropsychology. Tim Chalice has beautifully sort of outlined this.
*  You've got the sort of neuropsychological, lesion based, human based science. You've got the
*  Sheratonian tradition of looking at neurons and treating the brain as an organ to be studied just
*  like a liver or a kidney. And then you've got the whole computer science revolution, neural networks,
*  computer science, information theory, information processing. And those three traditions sort of
*  marched along in parallel, the biomedical view of the brain, the neuropsychological view of the
*  brain and the computer science view of the brain. And then you have to decide which one of those
*  traditions is going to give you that feeling of understanding via theories of a phenomena and
*  which is the one that's going to help you fix Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and all those. And it
*  just began to be apparent to me that the win for fixing would probably be to treat the brain like
*  an organ to a large degree and understanding it was actually going to end up being parceled up between
*  neuropsychology that became cognitive neuroscience and the computer scientists.
*  And the neuropsychology and computer science would be aided by two other areas that are very
*  helpful, which is philosophy and by complexity science. And that in a way, the organ view of the
*  brain and the fixing, you know, what's called the sort of neuromolecular view of the brain
*  was going to be left out of the party to some degree. That's what I began to realize.
*  And that's okay. If you want to have a neuromolecular circuit view of the brain in order to do medicine,
*  that's fantastic. But it's going to be the philosophers, the complexity scientists,
*  the psychologists and the computer scientists who are going to give us the explanatory objects,
*  I think, to understand intelligence. Let's talk about the role of things like philosophy
*  and psychology and so on here. You know, a lot of my previous guests have also said that they
*  consider themselves, and they're neuroscientists, but they consider themselves more psychologists
*  because they're coming at it from this higher top down sort of level, right? They have to think about
*  what the function is, what the computation is. So if psychologists have it right in terms of how
*  to approach understanding the brain, that we need to study these higher cognitive functions at that
*  level, do we just need better psychologists? Is it more a need for better philosophy embedded
*  in an evolutionary perspective for how cognitive functions might improve fitness? Or what? I mean,
*  are we lacking that theoretical drive? You know, I'm all for pluralism in science,
*  and I'm very, very wary of saying we need more of this and few of these. I think,
*  you know, I do think that people like Matt Botvinick, you know, Josh Tannenbaum,
*  Sam Gershman, who are coming more from a mixture of sort of normative theories plus experiment
*  are at the current time providing insights of the kind that people at DeepMind are interested in.
*  So I do think that it's going to be an alliance between the sort of mathematical psychologists
*  and the computer scientists that will provide more insight into intelligence. I do think that.
*  And also, especially when you want to do human work, right, you can do a lot of psychophysics
*  and humans at lower expense, and you can learn things without having to do lots of invasion.
*  Cognitive neuroscience, where you sort of get neural confirmation, right, you know, the famous
*  example of the connectionist accounts of the past tense, right, that how do you learn the past tense,
*  you know, because there are the ED for the regular verbs, and then they're
*  just one case after another for the irregular verbs. And so there was, as you know, a famous
*  debate about this, could one connections network do the irregular or regular, and then people like
*  Gary Marcus and Steven Pinker sort of showed the developmentally the kind of errors that get made
*  and not consistent with a single neural network, then patients that showed, depending on how much
*  you believed it, doubled associations between these abilities. So this debate between how these
*  things were done are very much at the level of neuropsychology plus lesions that help confirm
*  or refute these ideas. So cognitive neuroscience, people like Tim Chalice, Dick Passingham, I think
*  Russell Poldrack, making the case that you can use macroscopic brain data to inform
*  psychological theories. And I think that's what cognitive neuroscience, but it's still,
*  in my view, way above the level of neuron A connected to neuron B connected to neuron C.
*  So yes, but then there are people who will say that there are principles of cognition
*  that might be present in an identifiable circuit, like let's study the honeybee.
*  Look at those amazing feats of navigation and communication that a honeybee does.
*  Surely we can do Sheratonian style neuroscience on a honeybee, call what it does cognition,
*  and then by some scale invariant magic, extrapolate to higher types of cognition in mammals.
*  Right. So I don't think much of that approach, to be honest. I think it's fascinating to learn how a
*  honeybee waggles and navigates, but I'm not convinced that you're going to learn some circuit
*  level primitive that is going to be extrapolatable to mammalian cortical cognition. And if it does,
*  you'll end up with an abstraction that they've created there at the level of the circuit.
*  So even there, it will be a pyrite victory because they'll end up with some abstraction
*  that they carry up to the higher level rather than some connectivity requirements.
*  But when you're thinking, I'm not trying to push back too much, but when you're thinking,
*  at what level are we satisfied with a behavioral account, with an evolutionary account of
*  adaptation, adaptive behavior that increases fitness. And so we want to study, let's say,
*  honeybees, let's say the dancing gets them, communicates to their, what is a honeybee group?
*  A tribe? A hive or swarm? Yeah. So it communicates to the swarm, the direction, the distance of where
*  the honey is. And then we come up with an explanation or a story about how that's
*  evolutionarily fit. And that's where the computational level approach comes from,
*  right? And then we can make theories about what we might discover neuronally and look for
*  confirmation. But that's an abstraction in itself, to some degree. It's a story that we're telling
*  ourselves. And how do we know we're telling ourselves the right story? We don't have to go
*  too deeply into this. I just, that same question can apply at all levels, I think.
*  Yes, but you're absolutely right. But if you're, but then somebody will say, well, you're only
*  really understood it if you can say that you can actually simulate in your head the sequence of
*  flow of information from neuron to neuron. And then you're going to need to have, but that's
*  impossible. We can't do that in our head. We can't hold on to all these objects, especially when they
*  start interacting in a many body way. You can't, you can't intuit it. That's why differential
*  equations and models help because they can actually reproduce behavior that you can't
*  simulate in your head. Right? So you're always having to give over to some kind of abstraction.
*  And I could always say to that person, actually, you don't really understand it completely until
*  you give it to me at the quantum mechanical level. Right? And they just don't have an argument
*  against that. They're going to have to explain why they feel that they have discovered the
*  privileged level of understanding and they don't have an argument for it. What they have is that's
*  the level at which they can intervene and manipulate, but that's different. Right? That's the sort of
*  what I call the medical causal manipulative view thing, but only in rare cases do they blob onto
*  each other, right? Blom onto each other. Right? Usually I think they dissociate, right? That's what
*  physics are called effective theories. Right? You can work with the rules of thermodynamics
*  without always having to think in terms of statistical mechanics, even though one is
*  entirely explained by the other in that particular case. So it's just a confusion between
*  the kind of theories that you can do explanatory work with and what you need to do in order to fix
*  something. And Newell made this case. You don't need to know how your computer works. When you
*  program on it, unless it breaks. Right. Right? Yeah. So do you view the levels issue as one of
*  a gradient, right? So you do have some cases like let's say eye movements where you feel
*  pretty certain. You feel like you understand it. If you understand the neuronal circuitry underneath
*  and it maps on well to the process. And then you go a step up, you know, is that a gradient level?
*  Is it an analog going up or are there really these distinct levels that at some point,
*  like an electron, you have to jump to the next? I don't know. I think it could be. I think one
*  has to be avoid making absolute statements. I think it is a kind of gradient where the amount
*  of variance explained by a level goes down the lower you go. Right. In other words, you're always
*  the component parts with which you construct your theories to explain what's happening are level or
*  two down. Right. And then that does most of the work for you. And then you can drop below that.
*  So you have level N, you have level M plus one and your level N minus one,
*  level N minus one is good for level N and level N is good for level M plus one.
*  The amount of variance explained by N minus one to explain level N plus one drops is my guess would
*  be as you go down and down and down. So I think it is a continuum. And that's why people intuitively
*  don't feel that they need to be particle physicists to be circuit neuroscientists. Right. And chemists
*  don't feel like they have to be particle physicists to be chemists. And this is the point that Phil
*  Anderson made. So there is no previous level. Each one has its own degrees of freedom and its
*  own explanatory objects. And it's usually going to be one level down or two in my view. So occasionally
*  I do a joke of the show. I just I just invented one. Can I try it out on you? Yes. But okay,
*  don't I can't promise I'll laugh. Oh, no, I'm they're not made for laughing. Okay, how do you
*  define a gentleman? I don't know. It's your neuroscientist friend who can explain to you
*  how his computer works, but doesn't. That's actually not so bad. Some of my listeners will
*  be happy with that. Okay. Yeah. Well, well, the only thing is, is maybe the women who are
*  neuroscientists will not be so thrilled. It's okay, because I understand there's sexism in the joke.
*  I mean, I can't say gentle person, you know. All right. Yeah.
*  John, so you have all of these different tracks with what you're doing. What percentage among all
*  these vocational terms do you consider for yourself? So, you know, neuroscientist versus
*  neurologist versus psychologist versus philosopher versus author, I dare say. Yeah. Can you break it
*  down currently? I feel slightly neuroscientist is such a nascent field that I find the term
*  slightly irritating. Because it, you know, it holds out a promise that it can't keep
*  still in my view. But that's just, it's a little bit like calling yourself an artist.
*  You know, that's for other people to call you. Okay. Neurologist, I feel a little better about
*  because, you know, it's a designated field of medical intervention. And, you know, I do look
*  after stroke patients. I don't think that that's an opinion. I know how to look after stroke patients.
*  So neurologist, philosopher, I think my philosophy friends would say you're not an official
*  philosopher. So maybe. So yes, I suppose cognitive neuroscientist and neurologist would be okay.
*  But really, I think I'm just a kind of critic. Just about to ask what percentage irritated
*  are you? I do fear for the intellectual health of universities in general and of disciplines. I,
*  you know, maybe this is the chance to talk about why philosophy is so important. Yeah.
*  I think, you know, if you look at people like Thomas Kuhn,
*  and then people who've been inspired by him, like this wonderful, I can't recommend him enough
*  philosopher and historian of science Hassock Chang at Cambridge, who's written some beautiful books.
*  And he basically has this idea that philosophy is a form of complementary science.
*  He's quite bold. He actually says that philosophy can add to scientific knowledge
*  by thinking about exactly those topics that specialization has banished.
*  Right. So it's not just looking back over the past and being careful in the defining of terms,
*  but actually there are lots of things that are fallen by the wayside that specialties don't want
*  to think about. Like, for example, the whole conversation we've been having,
*  and that paper in your own, I think in one way, the reason why it made splash that it did is
*  because it's not that common to have such papers in scientific journals. And I should say that
*  there were some journals were not too pleased at the idea of having a paper like that,
*  because it might alienate the neuroscientists. So philosophy is a form of complementary knowledge
*  generation where it sort of gets between the gaps and the interstices of why do we know what we know?
*  Why do we think we know what we know? Why did we do this and not that? Why did we all love the mouse
*  and no longer study the cat, the dog or the monkey? In other words, it's more a sort of critical style
*  that is essential to the generation of scientific knowledge, not just a way of criticizing
*  of criticizing knowledge builders, you contribute yourself. So I think Haseok Chang
*  is very, very right about that. And then an interestingly enough, speaking to my brother,
*  when I try talking about irritated, he doesn't get annoyed at me when I want him to define
*  complexity. One of the things that he says is what the Santa Fe Institute does from the complexity
*  side is to address all these thorny issues that the specialist sciences don't want to have to
*  entertain. So what is interesting is that when it comes to both thinking about what does it mean to
*  understand the mind via the brain or how are we going to generate general AI, it's really interesting
*  that a lot of the way of thinking about all this is going to come from, I think,
*  complexity science, come from philosophy, come from psychology, come from the computer scientists.
*  But you know, it hasn't yet there have been millennia. I mean, maybe not for complexity
*  science, but philosophy, right? That's why I asked about how we approach these things in our own
*  mind today versus 1000 years ago. I think philosophy is a secondary subject. I think what philosophy
*  does is it runs along in parallel, like a super brainy tugboat. And it's there to optimize the
*  quality of the knowledge and add to it that is being generated by the primary specialties.
*  So in other words, you know, Daniel Dennett has made, for example, has made an enormous
*  effort to understand the neuroscience and he's attends neuroscience conferences all the time.
*  Mm hmm. So philosophers are kind of like the secondary specialists who can actually
*  make sure that the primary knowledge generators do a good job. Is it fair to say that one of
*  the philosophers main job is to figure out what the right question is? Yes, I think I think that
*  is a I mean, I think a lot of creativity in general is about formulating questions rather
*  than giving answers. And I think that's what happens a lot when people have date, you know,
*  they get their PhDs and they do all their exams and then they write their papers that their PIs
*  want them to write. So it's all sort of generating answers to exams and to questions. And then when
*  you have to come up with your own questions, suddenly they panic, Oh my God, I have no one
*  to tell me what I should worry about. So I think I think to some degree, the philosophical
*  generation of creative questions is important. And, you know, 200 years ago, all scientists
*  call themselves natural philosophers nowadays, especially in neuroscience. It's a they spit,
*  they spit out. Yeah, nasty. Right. Yeah. But it's completely wrongheaded. And you're philosophizing
*  all the time, as Dan Dennett points out just badly, if you don't admit it. And if you do it
*  well, it can, as Hesok Chang says, greatly enhance the quality of what you do. And, you know,
*  Einstein and Boor, they all talked overtly about the importance of philosophy. So it's a it's a
*  way of asking questions, it's a way of thinking critically, it's a way of defining terms logically.
*  And it's also a way of addressing questions that just go unanswered, because they're not part
*  of the Kuhnian notion of normal science. In other words, Kuhn was not just about revolutions
*  and paradigm shifts. He was about the theories of normal science. And one of the things that Kuhn
*  said was that you have to exclude certain ideas and certain vocabularies and certain people
*  for that specialty to proceed. I'll give you a great line, if you don't mind, from Kuhn.
*  I actually saved it for you because I was looking at it last night.
*  Is this from his? Is this from his? What is the book called?
*  No, no, this is this is actually from my Hesok Chang book. So here's the first quote,
*  criticism is the lifeblood of all rational thought, Karl Popper. To turn Sir Karl's view
*  on its head, it is precisely the abandonment of critical discourse that marks the transition
*  to a science. Thomas Kuhn, Thomas Kuhn. Just to see the subversion of that statement,
*  it is precisely the abandonment of critical discourse that marks the transition to a science.
*  In other words, the point being made there as a deep one is that you don't want critical,
*  subversive thought within a specialist science. You want to all share an assumption, share a
*  vocabulary, and you don't want someone to say, why are you doing optogenetics to study this animal
*  circuit to understand this? Why do you think that's even going to answer the question?
*  That's annoying, right? Because you want to get on with the conference. You want to get on with
*  your grant writing. So the deep point that Kuhn is making there is that that kind of questioning is
*  banished. And it's the philosophers who are the ones who are going to be allowed to ask those
*  critical questions as they run alongside the production of the specialty. Do you see what
*  I'm saying? I mean, and that is true. You try and question the enterprise at a scientific conference
*  and you'll be removed by security as a mad homeless person. Well, John, gosh, that's the first,
*  you're the first guest to offer a quote. That's so generous. Thank you for-
*  Well, it's such a great Thomas Kuhn quote because it detonates the more you think about it.
*  That's great. Let's talk just a little bit more about, unless we want to go on in philosophy,
*  I was going to kind of wrap up the behavior paper approach.
*  Do you think that the proper study of behavior, if we go with a behavior first implementation here,
*  and the understanding that follows, do you think that that will,
*  I think I know your answer here, but do you think that that will lead to understanding
*  non-behavioral cognition, things like consciousness, latent thought patterns, et cetera,
*  where there isn't per se a behavior to be, unless there is a behavior and I'm not recognizing it?
*  Well, I mean, you know, consciousness, I'm trying to avoid both in this conversation and in the
*  book. I mean, I feel Christoph Koch gave a great talk in Dublin at the Schrodinger Festschrift
*  last September, and I had a chance to speak with him and he, I much prefer the idea that
*  consciousness is a feeling that you should think about it more like pain than the ultimate
*  cognitive achievement. Yes, achievement though, that's a great phrase. I think some people think
*  consciousness is sort of the pinnacle of cognition, and I don't think that's correct.
*  I think it's sort of more like pain. And, you know, I was at a meeting on animal cognition or
*  something, I can't remember the exact name of the convent, NYU, early last year, and there was a
*  woman whose name I'm forgetting who was doing beautiful work trying to see whether fish feel
*  pain. Beautiful, very clever experiments, making the case that it's not just aversion to a stimulus,
*  but it was actual pain, you know, somewhat similar to Joseph LeDoux's sort of recent concern that
*  we're calling aversive responses fear, when we shouldn't be doing that. So here's again,
*  but nevertheless, I do think we can get some experimental traction on pain, how far you can
*  get to the subjective feeling of pain versus just the motor response to a noxious stimulus
*  is an open question. It's not an area that I'm involved with. But I think efference copy,
*  the notion of self and non-self pain, going that route could be really useful. I mean,
*  Nick, I was going to recommend a book, Nicholas Humphries, who, who the philosopher,
*  psychologist actually, who a friend of Dan Dennett's, wrote a wonderful book called soul dust,
*  where he talks about how we might get towards the science of consciousness.
*  So I think that philosophers and psychologists have very interesting things to say and animal
*  experimentalists about these things. I do. Do you think that we have a hypothesis,
*  you know, coming from that sort of computational level of human like intelligence, sufficient,
*  you know, to entertain pursuing general AI or something like consciousness, we don't need to
*  harp on consciousness. It's, you know, just, I think, you know, I don't work on on on higher
*  cognition. But I think that wonderful paper by Josh Tenenbaum, Lake, I can't remember his first
*  name, Brendan Lake, Brendan Lake, that we wrote in BBS, where they made suggestions as to what
*  the component parts would need to be. Yeah. We're really great to get towards general AI,
*  intuitive sociality, intuitive physics. I think that, yes, that they are coming up with a kind of
*  normative view of the components that you would need for general intelligence. And they are
*  offering it up to Matt Botvinick and the crew at DeepMind. And he's running with it, too. Yeah.
*  Yes, I think they are. I think that I think there's some interesting psychological level,
*  normative level views that are very, very interesting. You know, then you've got,
*  you know, the Fristonian predictive coding way of thinking about the brain and, you know, a super
*  normative view of the brain. Right. He's not particularly interested in how it might be
*  instantiated. Although I think so, yes, but as you can see, all of this is quite high level and
*  abstract. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to hopefully in a few weeks, I'll we'll be talking about Markov
*  blankets and the free energy principle. And so that'll be fun. Right. And whoever you get,
*  who can actually explain it clearly. Yeah, we'll see. But again, that's very different from
*  thinking that we're going to get it by studying a small circuit in Drosophila. Do you think,
*  given that, you know, there's your preference, let's say, to approach from the computational level
*  and the benefits thereof, does it even make sense to model AI after the brain? I mean, you know, so
*  you have these units that were originally inspired by neurons, and then there's abstractions. And
*  then every once in a while you come back and you add dendritic components to the units in your
*  neural network, et cetera. But does that even make sense if we're really coming at it from the
*  functional computational perspective? Well, I mean, I think you have to say that given that
*  the only object so far that has general AI, general intelligence is the brain in animals and humans,
*  then not to look there would be pretty bloody minded, right? Because as everyone is pointing
*  out, you know, Gary Marcus points this out, Brendan Lake and the others pointed this out that
*  classification is not the same as building models of the world.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Surely, if you want to find out how to do it, you're going to have to look at the one place
*  where it's successfully been implemented. So does that mean that you have to blue brain project like
*  reconstruct the brain all the way up from its circuitry? No. I mean, and in fact, as I said,
*  the deep mind people explicitly say they don't think you need to reconstruct the brain from the
*  ground up. But of course, they believe that psychology and even neuroscience may be providing
*  the missing bits that are not present in the neural network abstraction that they're currently
*  using. You know, because you know, they basically have a universal kind of architecture, admittedly,
*  they're modularizing it more now, adding external memory. And they also have a couple of learning
*  algorithms. But what happens if not only is the architecture far more modular than they think,
*  but even the learning algorithms might be much more modular. If you read somebody like Randy
*  Gallistel, right? He says, why do we believe that there's going to just be a few learning rules?
*  What if each each function that comes along both within an animal and across animals is associated
*  with own special learning mechanism? I mean, that's the kind of nightmare I think for
*  AI, if it turns out that not only do you have modularity in architecture, but you've got
*  modularity in the learning algorithms as well. And I think Jeff Hinton recently has stated that
*  we're going to have to go back and dream up new learning algorithms. So yes, I think you go and
*  look at the one place that solved the problem. Now the level at which you have how deep down you need
*  to go to get the answer is an open question. But you know, Nico Krieger's quarter very much believes
*  that a neural network modeling approach is going to bridge sort of behavioral stuff like in our paper
*  and neural circuit detail. And he really thinks that you're going to go between cognitive
*  neuroscience, psychology, behavior and neural circuitry. The bridge in between is
*  sort of neural network modeling and AI. He sees it as the if I'm understanding correctly,
*  and I've spoken to him as the kind of rescuer that has been a bridge.
*  Why are you rolling your eyes right now, John?
*  I'm not. I'm just kidding.
*  How did you know he'll kill me? No, I am. I sort of admire both the optimism and I think I admire
*  the fact that he's articulated a way forward. He actually has thought deeply about the existence
*  of the problem and has thought of a way to bridge the seemingly unbridgeable areas of sort of
*  behaviorally inspired task based conceptions at the cognitive level and the neural
*  implementation level. And he thinks that in a sense, neural network modeling will be the way
*  to bridge between them. And I think he's articulated it almost better than anyone
*  that I've heard about that. I just don't know whether it's going to deliver the goods. That's
*  all. Right. So let's let's wrap up talking about the paper here with one final question. And then
*  I want to ask you some more general kinds of questions. So what advice would you give to
*  someone that might be listening, who's in a lab that is completely unfocused on behavioral concerns,
*  say a grad student in their in his or her third year or a postdoc or something? What advice would
*  you give them? Well, I thought I'd give them three bits of advice. One is when they go to SFM,
*  go on a random walk through the posters. Okay, that's just go to don't just go on to your area.
*  Sure. So have a day or two where you just random walk to have a PI that will allow you to go to
*  the library and have a reading day. In other words, find a way to read books. What's the one book
*  that you would recommend if someone's going to go really specifically to give people like a
*  foundation for thinking along the lines of this neuron paper that we've been talking about?
*  I would say I would say the book which I think is really thoughtful,
*  besides yours, which will be the one that comes out.
*  The book this book is more, I hope short book to cover this for the intelligent general public,
*  right? In other words, because I actually feel that there are lots and lots of books coming out
*  about the brain all the time, but a book that sort of tries to talk about these issues that
*  we're discussing, I can't actually think of one, right? You either. So that's why we're doing it.
*  But the book, I think that the first chapters are really thoughtful is the book by
*  Charleston Cooper, called the organization of mind, it's a it's more of a textbook.
*  But Tim Charles, I always think has been very, very thoughtful is very thoughtful.
*  But that book by Charleston Cooper, the organization of mind, I think is
*  really interesting, historically, scientifically, and it's really a cognitive, it's basically making
*  a claim for cognitive neuroscience. Great. Okay, this can be a lot of long show notes
*  for this episode. This is great. And just one other book that I would say, if you want to,
*  this is not about neuroscience, but if you want to sort of see where philosophy and history of
*  science come together in an incredible way, it's a dense book, but it's called Inventing Temperature
*  by Hasok Chang, the philosopher I was talking about. Okay, great. And it's just an amazing
*  book to show you what can happen when you make a case for the history of philosophy of science
*  informing how we think about a scientific phenomenon. Great. So your second piece of
*  advice, I'm sorry I interrupted you was to have a day or two to go to the library.
*  Yeah. And then I think third is to seek out those people in the field that you think are the thinkers,
*  in other words, get them to have a conversation with you, you know, see why what they think,
*  in other words, visit another lab, go to another lab's meetings, go to some other talks on your
*  campus, you know, go to a history and philosophy of science talk. If you're a molecular neuroscientist,
*  go to a systems neuroscience talk. In other words, try and inject some intellectual variety into your
*  academic experience. Because it's so easy just to be spend hours and hours and hours deep into the
*  night in your own lab, trying to collect data. And you just don't have a broad intellectual
*  experience as a consequence. So you don't recommend standing up in lab meeting and brandishing your
*  fist in the air and quitting? No, but I think there's a hunger amongst the young. And then I
*  would also say what I've noticed is that there's some really thoughtful things going on in the
*  blogs and on Twitter. In other words, really thoughtful people who, you know, like Mark Humphrey,
*  right? Mark, is that right? I think, you know, very thoughtful sort of blog and pieces. And I think
*  to be part of an intelligent Twitter community and to see the piece. I mean, I actually,
*  I'm on Twitter and I have to say some very interesting feeds, threads,
*  some very interesting pieces that I wouldn't have known about. If you follow the right people,
*  you could really, really be part of a debate that I wasn't possible before.
*  So you have, I know that the lab has a Twitter feed at Blam lab.
*  But yeah, that's the one that no, that's the one I use. Yeah. Okay. You know, I've thought about
*  whether it was a good or a bad thing that I'm sort of hiding under Blam or not. But at this point,
*  I don't really feel like switching over. No, I hear you. Someone told me I needed to get a
*  Twitter feed specifically for the podcast. And I thought, God, no. Yeah. But yeah. So yeah. So
*  SFN reading, meeting diverse people on your campus, and then getting to be part of some
*  thoughtful tweets and blogs. It can be very informative.
*  So my final thought, just to wrap up this paper is that, of course, science is frustrating and
*  that's part of the beauty of it. But so this paper and the reaction that it has garnered,
*  it's an example to me of this strained beauty of how science slowly progresses, right? And it
*  corrects itself as it lumbers on and this is almost a corrective energy that's been injected.
*  Yes, I mean, it's actually fascinating. You know, I never and I mean this sincerely, I,
*  you know, you write these things more. I don't know. You hope that somebody will read it, but
*  you don't. You don't think it's going to be prescriptive. But I have to say it's amazing
*  to me how this paper and its exhortations have sort of trickled into the vernacular. I mean,
*  there have been counterpapers about behavior, you know, and churchmen had a very good papers
*  saying how you have to sort of mix pragmatism with the ideal. Sure. There have been conferences that
*  have been held with behavior prominent in the title. So I feel in a way that it has actually
*  a little bit. Yes. I mean, it gets cited a lot. There's the new journal, the behavioral,
*  the Journal of Behavioral, I forget the name, Nature, Human Behavior, right? Yes, I feel that
*  has been an awareness. You know, there was just an editorial just this week or last week from the
*  Journal of Neuroscience about how to write behavioral papers. And this was a journal that
*  there was a big. You write them and you send them somewhere besides to us.
*  I don't know if you know this, but there was a big fracas about whether the Journal of Neuroscience
*  was going to stop accepting purely behavioral papers. And then Reza Shadnia and David Herzfeld
*  did an analysis, which is available on bio archive of the citation rates for purely behavioral papers
*  in the Journal of Neuroscience and actually showing that they were the cited the most.
*  Right now, that shouldn't be the metric that you use. Right. But it was, but it's, but I find it
*  really interesting that there's been this almost vault fast. And now you've got the Journal of
*  Neuroscience with an issue, an editorial on the ideal form of a behavioral paper. I don't think
*  that it's a coincidence that came out after that paper and the influence it's had. So yes, I'm more
*  optimistic and more heartened than I ever expected to be about the reception of this paper. And what
*  will inevitably happen, which is what always happens, is that people will, it will dissolve
*  into being, well, that's just obvious. We all knew it and its origins will be lost in time.
*  But you know, that's the price you just pay.
*  Very good. Okay. Well, thank you for diving deep into these issues and from the paper and
*  it's time for some freeze, fight or flight if you have a few more minutes.
*  Okay. Okay. So John, what is a talent that you have that not many people know about?
*  I know you have a lot of talents that a lot of people do know about.
*  I don't really have any talents. What I do have, I mean, I do have anti-talents. In other words,
*  I can't open a wine bottle. I can't parallel park. I don't know my left and right. I can't cook.
*  I'm actually a kind of bundle of failures that have led me to actually do this one thing.
*  You know, the only thing I can think of is I've always been kind of good at racket sports. So,
*  you know, at some time in my life, I played for my school at badminton, table tennis, tennis, squash.
*  I always was on the teams for racket sports. So I was kind of, even though I'm a complete
*  clutz in everyday life, it seems like I do have some
*  eye-hand coordination of another form that simply fails to generalize.
*  And then, you know, I suppose early on in life, I did do a lot of drawing. I thought one day I
*  might be a cartoonist. I haven't really turned my hand towards that. So I like that. But otherwise,
*  there's nothing that I would be the first to die on a desert island.
*  That's good. Yeah, you really are kind of a failure.
*  So I was recently reading James Baldwin's book, No Name on the Street. This is published in 1972.
*  And it's about his account being a black man traveling multiple parts of the world, but
*  also in the United States. And the book ends on this quote. I have a quote for you. And the book
*  ends on this quote. I recommend this book to you, doesn't it? You may have recommended this book
*  to me. Yes, how does it end? It is terrible to watch people cling to their captivity and insist
*  on their own destruction. I think black people have always thought this about America and Americans,
*  and have always seen spinning above the thoughtless American head the shape of the wrath to come.
*  Hmm. Wonderful.
*  Is bias something that you worry about with AI systems?
*  Well, you know, it's interesting that I would love to think that there's nothing inevitable
*  about intelligence having biases. And sometimes I think wouldn't it be wonderful to sort of start
*  again and have intelligent systems without this utterly unintelligent
*  stance that some people are better than others. I mean, it just doesn't follow. It's sort of
*  antithetical to the notion of intelligence that people would think this way. And you know,
*  we've just had this deeply embarrassing, yet again, revelation from Watson of his racism.
*  Oh, I didn't know that. I didn't know there was a documentary. And again,
*  he comes out so nice. And it's so you know, it's so funny because I, you know, we just went to see
*  if Beale Street could talk, which was a novel by Baldwin, that has been made into a film by the
*  wonderful director Barry Jenkins, who made Moonlight. And you watch these fantastic people,
*  just the indifferently crushed under the white wheel. It's just baffling. I mean, if you are an
*  empirical person, you just don't understand why is this and what I you know, just to say, I think
*  I would say I feel like when you have an intelligent system, it's capable of developing cognitive
*  disorders. So wherever you have cognition, you have cognitive disorders. Psychiatry is the medical
*  field to deal with the cognitive disorders that are thrown up by intelligent systems.
*  This is something that Mark Humphries echoes as well on his in the spike work. So,
*  so, you know, interestingly, it would maybe if you could have a psychiatry of AI systems,
*  you might get some insight into how inevitable is it that you're going to have profound, very hard
*  to cure cognitive disorders, like racism, maybe that's something to hold out for, could we have a
*  bigotry free intelligent system that I don't know.
*  Just yet another failure on your part here. So, yeah, just a few more questions here. So
*  what will come first, understanding our own cognition and intelligence or an AI that replicates
*  it? I mean, I prediction the future is a terrible thing. I think that if things were to continue
*  at their current pace, and I were willing to believe in the optimism of the Macbot the next
*  to this world, and the 2012 wasn't just a peak before another AI winter, I'd like to think
*  that doing really good cognitive neuroscience and psychology, plus what's happening at places
*  like deep mind, in other words, that the prescriptions put forward by Lake and Co in
*  that article were taken up, that that's the way it's going to go. I don't think it's going to come
*  from animal model neuroscience that scales up. What's one example when luck has played a
*  particularly large role in something that has shaped your scientific trajectory?
*  It's freeze, fight or flight. So you can always get it. It's all luck. I would say in the two
*  fields that I'm involved in, right, sort of computational, experimental, motor control,
*  motor learning, and in sort of neural recovery. Both of those were based on entirely serendipitous
*  events. One was that I met in a meeting. In fact, it was pure luck. It was at a meeting being given
*  Richard Frikoviac, who used to be the head of the functional imaging lab in London,
*  was giving a talk on pet studies of motor recovery after stroke.
*  I was asked as a neurology resident to escort him around Columbia University.
*  I went to his talk. I asked a question at the end of his talk about motor recovery after stroke,
*  finding it interesting. There was a professor of motor control called Claude Gez, who wrote the
*  chapters in the original Kandell and Schwartz. He came up to me and said,
*  you asked a very interesting question about recovery of motor control after stroke.
*  But in order to really get at your question, you need to understand motor control.
*  So you should join my lab and study motor control. In other words, in one afternoon,
*  both the scientific side and the clinical side happened. I have no idea what would have happened
*  if I hadn't attended that lecture on stroke recovery with Claude Gez present in the audience
*  to hear my question. So it was pure luck. If you consider it good that that happened.
*  But otherwise, I honestly do wonder whether that afternoon hadn't happened. I wouldn't be
*  talking to you right now. Yeah, so interesting. That's a good one. What is one idea that you can't
*  do or don't have time to do or the resources or something that you would hope that someone else
*  might pursue? Well, that's a very pertinent question right now. There are two areas that I
*  certainly don't think I'm going to get involved in. I think one would be a really rigorous program
*  to study expertise. In other words, what's the difference between being skilled and being expert?
*  This is a subject I wanted to talk about today. I'm very interested in skill and what it means
*  and how it morphs into expertise. I think Adrian Haith, who's the co-director of BLAM, who was a
*  postdoc with me before, I think he's so bright and so talented. I think he's going to start moving
*  in the direction of skill and expertise. You guys have written about automaticity and the effects
*  of practice and such. Yes, so we're very interested in that area. I think really, to be honest,
*  he's the one who's going to make all the relevant discoveries down the line.
*  Then the other one, I think, is we very, very much need a monkey model of descending pathways
*  after injury. In other words, a stroke monkey model. I think we're going to need in stroke
*  recovery the equivalent of what happened when Mayland Alon came up with DBS for movement
*  disorders and Parkinson's disease. I think we're going to need a physiological intervention
*  to repair. I think that's going to require a very... Now, I'm lucky that I'm good friends with
*  Stuart Baker, who's a superb monkey physiologist in England, who is now beginning to take on that
*  challenge. I'm going to play some role from the sidelines. I would say expertise and what it is
*  and a physiological model of hemiparesis that allows an intervention are the two things that
*  I think I will play a secondary role in, but I don't have the time to devote my time to.
*  Yeah. Very good. Okay. On a scale of one to 10, one being I have no idea where this is all headed
*  and 10 being I feel pretty certain I know where this is all headed. How would you rate your own
*  internal model for what AI will look like maybe 20 years from now and what neuroscience will look
*  like about 20 years from now? I'm just going to take what my instinctive feeling is,
*  which is I feel like we're probably not going to have flexible general AI in 20 years. I don't
*  think so. I'd like to be wrong actually, but if I'm honest, I feel like we don't really know what it
*  is. We don't know what we're going to need. I don't think 20 years is... And 20 years isn't as long as
*  people think. It's really not. As I get older, I realize that more and more. When oncogenes were
*  discovered in the 80s, people thought, aha, we're going to cure cancer. Here we are 40 years later
*  and we haven't. Neuroscience, I feel like we're going to do really interesting biomedical neuroscience.
*  I am actually going to hold out hope that there are going to be better cures at the neuromolecular
*  level. I'd like to believe that someone's going to come up with something for ALS, something for
*  Alzheimer's disease. I do. That kind of neuroscience, when you say neuroscience,
*  I'm talking about implementational level. I know. That's the way you think of neuroscience.
*  I think that will be successful. I don't believe that circuit implementation level neuroscience is
*  going to give us the answer to the first question you asked. Well, John, thank you so much. You've
*  been really generous with your time. That's a long time for me to continue to irritate you.
*  You haven't irritated me at all. Let me just say that I think that your program is
*  exceptional. I think you're doing an amazing thing here intellectually.
*  You just told me you brought Tim Behrens on. Tim, he and I are friends. I think he's wonderful.
*  He's great. He is the kind of person who could, in fact, bring together
*  an implementational version of more computational algorithmic. If anyone, the flavor of person who
*  will actually manage to maybe bridge this along with someone like Nico is Tim. He's got that
*  factor X and the ambition to do it. Actually, right when I began speaking with you, I think
*  my interview with him was posted, so people will have heard it obviously by the time. Tim can also
