# BI 149 William B. Miller: Cell Intelligence
**Brain Inspired:** [October 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2AGvaarbgg)
*  All cells have all of the capacities that we grant ourselves. They're cognitive,
*  that means they measure information, they're aware of those measurements, they
*  are sentient, they have feelings the way we have feelings, but they
*  have states of preference. We are solutions to cellular problems. It's not
*  good for our egos to think of ourselves this way, but what we are is we are a
*  wonderful habitat. Our kind of intelligence is how we measure intelligence
*  across the scale, but that's not the way biology should measure it and it's not
*  the way evolution measures it.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hey everyone, I'm Paul and I am jetlagged. So the first thing I want to say is that
*  I just returned from Norway where I participated in the annual conference
*  for the Norwegian Research School in neuroscience. So I just want to say hello
*  to my new Norwegian friends and thank you again for having me and I look
*  forward to throwing more axes with you anytime and or playing with more bows
*  and arrows. I had a really good time, so thanks. All right, as you know, mostly on
*  Brain Inspired, we talk about the intelligence of brains and or models of
*  brains. As you also know, brains are made of neurons among other cells and the
*  models that we discuss are made of units that to some miniscule degree mimic real
*  neurons. The key here is that we think of intelligence and cognition as a property
*  of the collective activities of all those neurons and or units. On this
*  episode, the focus is not on neurons per se, but on individual cells of all types.
*  So my guest today is William B. Miller who has just written the book Bioverse,
*  How the Cellular World Contains the Secrets to Life's Biggest Questions, which
*  is all about Bill's thoughts and research on the intelligence of
*  individual cells, be they neurons, skin cells, bacteria, and so on. Bill's claim
*  is that every cell is intelligent in its own right and has a sense of self in its
*  own right and these single cells strategically come together to engineer a
*  collective intelligence which makes up each of our bodies. And when I say us, that
*  refers not only to our own cells with our own DNA, but also the massive
*  collection of foreign cells within us that form partnerships with each other
*  and with our own cells, our microbiome. So we talk about all those concepts, Bill's
*  thoughts on cell intelligence versus brain intelligence, the current state of
*  cellular science, which Bill calls the era of the cell, and how he envisions that
*  science revolutionizing our health treatments, and many more topics. So I
*  linked to the book and Bill's website in the show notes at braininspired.co
*  slash podcast slash 149. Thank you to all my patreon supporters and students in
*  my online neuro AI course, either of which is an excellent way to support the
*  podcast if you value what I do and or you want to dive deeper into those kinds
*  of topics. For those of you watching on YouTube, I apologize we couldn't get
*  Bill's camera quite up to speed, so this turned out to be an audio-only episode.
*  Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy listening. Here's Bill. The book is bio verse how
*  the cellular world contains the secrets to life's biggest questions. Welcome to
*  the podcast, Bill. Nice nice to have you here. Thanks, Paul. I'm really thrilled to
*  be here. So this book is really a thorough dive into deep dive into the
*  individuality of our cells, their intelligence, their networking abilities,
*  and how we are not just our own cells, but a you know we're made up of our
*  microbiome, a huge collection of foreigners. So right, right. Yes, and you
*  know it's interesting I had this reaction I think it was around chapter 8
*  in the book that just swimming in these waters about individual cells and how
*  we're made up of them. I had to read contemplate how you know I feel like an
*  individual but in reality I'm many many many individuals and it's just a what a
*  miraculous thing to feel like an individual and yet we're made up of
*  many individuals. So thanks for making me re-contemplate that and do you in
*  your you know but right now I feel like an individual but for a moment I felt
*  like a collection of individuals in your you know as you're going through
*  your day do you feel like Bill Miller or do you feel like lots of individual
*  cells that make up Bill Miller? No, I feel absolutely a singular individual
*  and that's how it's meant to be. That's the super sauce. That's the
*  amazing seamless collaboration that exists among ourselves. I don't know how
*  much your listeners might know about the cellular world most people know almost
*  nothing but we're a specific class of living organism that's best termed a
*  super organism. We are maybe a hundred or more trillion cells maybe hundreds of
*  trillions if you include all of our microbes if we included all of our
*  viruses maybe even more than that. We don't actually know the exact number but
*  let's just say trillions and trillions that work together so seamlessly that
*  you feel like one person. I wake up in the morning I look in the mirror I go
*  eat your heart out George Clooney and I am gorgeous and but once I started
*  studying cells I realized that each and every single one of those cells is what
*  we term self referential. Well what does that mean? It means it's its own actual
*  problem-solving individual. Every single cell, every single microbial cell, every
*  single one of your personal cells, your pancreas cells, your liver cells, your
*  skin cells, every single one of them has is a living form which it's it's
*  exhilarating and daunting and frightening because now we have to
*  figure out how is it possible for all of these trillions of cells to work together
*  so well that I'm Bill Miller all day long and never don't quite feel that
*  way although we do have a number of experiences as living organisms that we
*  have never quite understood and we still don't have the information but there are
*  those sensations when you're out of body when you're when you're living on
*  another sphere you are you've reached an altered mental state and those may give
*  us clues on how to find out exactly how all of our cells work together so well.
*  How did you come to appreciate the cell and and maybe you could just mention how
*  you essentially switched careers to study this this new ish love of yours?
*  Well I love this question because I can tell the listeners that there is no one
*  that was more surprised than I that I turned from a contented career in
*  medicine I was a practicing academic and private practice physician for over 35
*  years and I had a passing interest in evolutionary biology but no much no more
*  than any ordinary doctor or scientist that that has taken that reads generally
*  it really hadn't been a focus of my concentration so I'll be quick about
*  this but I was at a medical meeting for my specialty in medicine and it
*  involved long days of sitting and listening to lectures and I can only do
*  that for a certain number of days before I go absolutely nuts I'm not really a
*  good sitting person. Days, I can only do it for hours. I know it's just oh it's it's
*  for me the first day is exciting the second day begins to start the agony
*  anyway so it comes around the third or fourth day and I've had it and it's mid
*  afternoon I turned to a one of my partners who happened to be with me and
*  I said I got to get out of here and we're in Chicago the meeting is a huge
*  convention center in Chicago it's a big annual meeting it's and I said let's go
*  someplace let's go to the Field Museum or the Art Institute you pick you pull he
*  chose the Field Museum so we we played hooky we go to this museum late in the
*  afternoon and I don't know how many people that are listening may have been
*  there but if you walk into the Field Museum there's this gorgeous magnificent
*  rotunda that you walk into and what caught my eye immediately and is meant
*  to is a I like to say it's a boy named Sue it's the Tyrannosaurus Rex it's that
*  magnificent Tyrannosaurus Rex that sits in your tunda of the Field Museum and I
*  was startled just the scale of it I just hmm I'd seen fossils before but the way
*  was presented the skillful way that was presented really attracted me and I
*  walked over to look at it and that's when everything changed I started to
*  notice that the bones of the Tyrannosaurus Rex have a remarkable
*  similarity to our own and that just completely shocked me so let me explain
*  that of course they're huge and we're talking about an enormous difference in
*  scale but the major features that the shape of the head of the humerus that's
*  this bone or the femur bone the big thigh bone the shape of the general
*  shape of the pelvis ribs the vertebrae that the alignment they're different but
*  the muscle insertions where the grooves are on the bones for the muscle
*  insertions were pretty close to what I know from human anatomy and I'm I was
*  very skilled at human anatomy based on what I was doing for a living and I
*  didn't know anything really about evolution but I did know that the
*  general thought was that it was all accidental that nothing was on purpose
*  it was always the source of random mutation and I'm just generally thinking
*  about it and realizing that this was a successful creature for over six million
*  years and then I'm looking at the arms and those arms are unbelievably tiny I
*  mean they are just they just make no sense at all but the arm bones are very
*  much like our bones and nothing made any sense to me and I was just confused and
*  interested I turned to my partner I said boy I'm not sure that what we were
*  taught makes any sense at all and he was very dismissive he's a super
*  intelligent guy he just said no it's all a matter of time and you're you're
*  wasting your time to think about it and for some reason that became a challenge
*  that was like a gauntlet in the front and so I decided to start looking things
*  up on the web it was at a period of time when the web existed fortunately when
*  was vital resource was this the 90s when was this this was the 90s yeah the late
*  90s okay a very very late early 2000s so you were searching on like Lycos or
*  something like that probably I cut I don't know I don't know I don't know I
*  know my connection I had the phone the dial phone was ringing anyway I was able
*  to get articles that I wouldn't orderly get from the library and I did utilize
*  local libraries including a local university library and I started to think
*  about it and one other quick thing then we can move on I had made an observation
*  in my medical practice that mattered to how all this turned out I was in a in a
*  field that offered guidance and advice by interpreting imaging for all sorts of
*  specialists so it would be the orthopedist of the the gastroenterology
*  doctors the neurologists often and I noticed that we were very reliant in in
*  radiology and imaging on patterns consistent patterns some of them were so
*  specific that we could make a very likely diagnosis almost certain
*  diagnosis for certain diseases for example on an MRI scan of the brain and
*  someone with toxoplasmosis there's a specific pattern around the this this
*  cerebral spiral fluid pathways in the middle of the brain you see that and you
*  can very closely predict that it's going to be toxoplasmosis and I started to
*  wonder why why why could we make that decision what was it about talk so that
*  brought it to that site and the feeling among all my partners was well that's
*  just they're just like little robots and they go there and they default they're
*  circulating around and that's what they find that spot they kind of like it and
*  that's fine but I said they like it he goes yeah they kind of like it well that
*  matter to me preference what has preference well robots don't really have
*  preference it seems like such an uncomplicated thought but it actually was
*  a very difficult one for my part is they didn't want to hear it they had no
*  interest in it it wasn't they're super smart guys and gals it just was not
*  interesting to them and it seized my imagination so what do we know now every
*  single one of these cells and when every single one of these pathogens is
*  seriously smart in its own limited scale it's intelligent what do I mean by
*  that at the cellular scale their problem-solving they they get a stream
*  of information and they interpret it they measure it this is an important
*  idea that cells are measuring information because it it tells us why we
*  have multicellularity why why do I exist why do you exist why are why can we as a
*  collection of cells and the trillions get along because cells measure together
*  to assess environmental uncertainties every cell measures the environment
*  and that makes its best guess and then it deploys its assets and it's it doesn't
*  have unlimited assets just like just like ourselves we have to make choices how
*  we're going to spend our energy we can do this it's a matter of focus we can do
*  this or that we don't have energy for both so we make a choice cells are not
*  different in that way they they have scant energy resources and they have to
*  deploy it sensibly they have to solve problems how do they do that well they
*  learned that they can solve problems better together than apart and that's
*  precisely why we exist we are we are solutions to cellular problems it's it's
*  not good for our egos to think of ourselves this way but what we are is we
*  are a wonderful habitat for exactly those combinations of the trillions of
*  cells my personal body cells and the and the microbiome that we share and our
*  microbiome as a species is quite specific compared to any other we share
*  certain bugs with other species or other primates and so on we share certain
*  with our dogs and our cats but if you take the whole composition it's very
*  species specific going further it's actually individual specific you have
*  your own personalized microbiome it is attuned to you and why is that because
*  they are partners they are mostly partners that yes they can threaten you
*  they certainly there can be pathogens that are lurking these can be dangerous
*  but most of the time all these cells and all of our microbes are getting along
*  just fine and you couldn't live without them and they can't live the way they
*  want to live without you that you are their state of preference and so I'm
*  happy to be satisfying I mean yeah I learned a lot in the book one of the
*  things is just how diverse are sort of I guess you call them sub microbiomes each
*  of our organs has its own specific collection of foreign cells I guess did
*  you use is the phrase sub microbiome in the book I know actually actually I was
*  going to steal it from you because I think it's brilliant I think that's a
*  very a good way to put it because we loosely tend to use the term microbiome
*  for our entire microbiome but if I talk about my skin I'll talk about my skin
*  microbiome my pancreas microbiome the term sub microbiome might make sense it
*  would be the pancreas sub microbiome I have to think about it but like I think
*  the important point for everyone that's watching it when listening to this is
*  each this is a very surprising thing I've been very very lucky I had a career
*  in medicine that has spanned now some of the great advances especially in imaging
*  which is where I spent a lot of my time when I first came out of my residency
*  computer tomography had only just begun ultrasound was extremely primitive no
*  such thing as a magnetic resonance imaging existed most of the great
*  nuclear medicine procedures that we're using today didn't exist almost none of
*  the interventional procedures that I did many a lot of work in interventional
*  work none of those existed so I've seen a huge and gratifying progress in
*  medicine and one of the things that I was taught and when I was in medical
*  matter of certainty is that your sterile on your insides except for your gut your
*  gut has bugs and they somehow do something which was not really known they
*  certainly they had something to do with digesting fibers and carbohydrates but
*  there was no conception that they were a critical part of our metabolism and
*  physiology like we understand today that no one knew that so I would say to a
*  patient oh good news the antibiotic that you use cures your urinary tract and your
*  urine is sterile and I really believe that and it was it was correct science
*  of that moment decades ago well that's wrong your urine is never sterile but we
*  did but you have gotten rid of the the disproportionate amount of the abnormal
*  of the pathogenic bug that was causing you symptoms so it's in a hugely
*  different nuance of understanding of the way thing is now we know that it is
*  beginning to become certain that absolutely every part of our body has
*  some constituent microbiome some of it is tiny like our brain has a very tiny
*  microbiome but it has it it our pancreas has an active microbiome in fact we we
*  now believe that it is an active player in cancer for instance it is believed
*  that a breakdown of the pancreatic microbiome that's called a dysbiosis
*  everything's got to have a scientific name and what we do we don't know we
*  don't know the answer we make up a scientific and it sounds wonderful
*  because we sound educated anyway anyway this is a good word dysbiosis because it
*  simply means that the normal friendly partnership between the bugs that
*  constitute them the normal background microbiome has broken down and that can
*  have many causes it could be due to cellular damages in the in our body
*  cells our pancreas cells like our insulin cells for instance insulin
*  producing cells that beta cells or it could be that there's has been an
*  interloper an outside it microbe that's come in to disturb the background
*  as it turns out there is pretty strong evidence that a fungal player causes an
*  inflammatory response in the pancreatic microbiome that somehow for reasons that
*  we don't yet understand triggers sufficient underlying cellular changes
*  to induce early stage pancreatic cancer and how with this will pan out and
*  whether future scientific studies will corroborate this absolutely is yet to be
*  seen but that's the initial information and and it makes an important point
*  every part of our body has its microbiome testes have a microbiome the
*  uterus has its microbiome that the lungs have a very important microbiome it
*  contributes to protecting us from infection and also it sets us up for the
*  possibility of infection so someday we may find a one way of treating SARS-CoV-2
*  of COVID would be to alter the microbiome of the lung rather than
*  necessarily having to wait until you're infected or necessarily have an
*  immunization or we may always need immunization I don't know I'm just
*  saying that it's a title it's a tantalizing prospect in this new year
*  of the cell that we're entering this new understanding of cellular life that
*  we're we stand on the threshold of at least beginning the search for an
*  entirely new ways of combating disease either preventing it entirely or
*  stopping it at an early stage before it really becomes highly damaging for us
*  even the fetus which we all knew we all were taught that absolutely every fetus
*  is sterile the placenta sterile amniotic fluid is sterile unless there's a bad
*  bug in there well now we're finding out that that's not the case the fetus has a
*  very tiny constituent microbiome the placenta which is always assumed to
*  absolutely be sterile probably has its own microbiome that's still a matter of
*  some debate an amniotic fluid definitely has some scattered bugs in it mostly and
*  rarely makes a is rarely a problem we're finding surprisingly that this
*  microbiome matches the mother's mouth microbiome more than any other body
*  side we don't really know why exactly that is but you got to you have to get
*  the data and then you can kind of work towards finding out new things along the
*  way why is this important it means that from the moment of conception we are
*  being subjected to the influences of our microbial companions and even if the
*  amount the number of microbes that a fetus has is tiny the mother's
*  metabolism is highly dependent on its microbial partnerships and so the fetus
*  has been bathed by these these metabolic products from from the get-go so we're
*  never ever separated from microbial life it's in fact this is the way I think
*  people should look at it we are taught in fact even most scientists even most
*  biologists today insist on talking about the relationships between micro our
*  microbiome and our cells as us and them so us is our body cells our special kind
*  of cells our cells with our DNA our specific DNA they're the specific cells
*  they're called eukaryotic cells fancy name it just means that these are the
*  kinds of cells that allow organisms like us and they have a nucleus they have a
*  nucleus and prokaryotes that's bacteria and other types of cellular microbes
*  don't have a nucleus the end result is it's wrong to look at it strictly as us
*  it's a consensual we and that's the term that's important here consensual we
*  where we're negotiated product all the time no matter what is happening to us
*  it we are always that product of the constellation of all of ourselves
*  working together and it governs our lifecycle in ways we have yet to
*  discover but one of the ways we probably age is that the partnerships break down
*  what does that mean it means that cells probably lose the ability to efficiently
*  signal one another why that is I don't know but the most likely pathway to
*  aging protecting aging is to improve cell cell signaling it's too new a
*  thought for us to have many experiments in that direction we were looking we're
*  finding out that many of the medications that we rely on are working through the
*  let's take up at many listeners people are watching have diabetes type 2
*  diabetes adults onset diabetes particularly well one of the most common
*  medications is metformin it's an excellent drug in fact it there's some
*  there's some good papers some good information suggesting that not only
*  does it work to lower blood sugars but it might be an anti-aging drug it might
*  protect cognition all sorts of things that that drug does that we still don't
*  understand completely but one thing we do understand now that we didn't reach
*  until very recently is that it appears that the mechanism of action of metformin
*  is through it's shifting our gut microbiome in a way that's improving us
*  yeah and we don't even know those ways specifically yet it's just that we now
*  we know to look because we have that information so on this podcast we talk
*  a lot about the complexity of the brain and you know the challenges in modeling
*  the brain and understanding it and as you're talking about you know potential
*  treatments by shifting and adjusting different the different participants of
*  our microbiomes and our sub as it were in microbiomes is there a worry or do
*  you have a worry that the the challenge is could be insurmountable in under you
*  know futzing with such a complex system as our microbiome is that that is just
*  going to be nearly impossible to know how to do I mean you're also just
*  talking about drugs and it was making me think of the medical industry no knock
*  on you but how we you know just bathe the body in in a drug and then you know
*  see if it works right so we don't really understand what effect a drug is having
*  and you were just talking about you know this this drug working through the
*  pathway of the microbiome so I guess my question is how and this is kind of an
*  aside so I apologize but you know how optimistic are you that we will
*  understand the shifting complexities of our microbiome enough to be able to know
*  how to treat certain organs or you know and so forth to shift it back into the
*  right place it's just a terrific question and biovers the book that
*  that's the reason that you're kind enough to have me on it really goes into
*  explaining exactly the reasons why I'm I am truly optimistic as I say in the
*  book we're in what I like to call the the new era of the cell the year of the
*  cell and I'll explain first what that means and then it's it's ramifications
*  throughout human history we we tend to concentrate on battles and politics and
*  religion you know religious battles particularly but when you look at what
*  are the things that have mattered most to the average person but leaving faith
*  aside that let's not go in that direction today because it's too
*  complicated what are the things that have really mattered well it's really
*  been medical revolutions and what kind of revolution some I'm talking about
*  there was vaccination before that inoculation before smallpox killed
*  hundreds of millions of people the smallpox has been virtually eradicated
*  polio another perfect example of a terrible scourge I'm old enough to
*  remember kids with braces walking in braces it was a killer also I grew up
*  with images of kids in iron lungs hmm so vaccination was one example of a
*  critical revolution what's another one antisepsis so that surgical wounds or
*  battle wounds could heal anesthesia can you imagine surgery before anesthesia in
*  the book I describe an operation in Boston in the early in the 1800s yeah
*  and 19th century and the horror of it is is unimaginable grabbing the tongue
*  exactly yeah you read that thank you so in all there have been six prior
*  revolutions including germ theory and imaging and now we're up to the seventh
*  I think it's the seventh it's the ear of the cell and why am I tall talking about
*  this in the terms of a role of revolution because it radically changes
*  all of how we look at biology and ultimately it will change how we as a
*  society look at ourselves knowing that all of ourselves are intelligent and
*  knowing further that we'll rely on a critical partnership with them forces us
*  to look at research in biology in an entirely different way so what does this
*  mean it means that we're going to leverage this actual cellular intelligence
*  this microbial intelligence to our own benefit so we engineer it's obvious that
*  we cooperate we measure together and we communicate and because we can do those
*  two things we can engineer that's why ourselves that's exactly what our cells
*  do they can measure they measure information they communicate abundantly
*  chattering away at each other all the time and they engineer what are they
*  engineering they're engineering us so we engineer because ourselves can so when
*  we talk about how do cells resemble humans it's really how humans resemble
*  it's really the opposite we we are the term is an epiphenomenal we're we're an
*  extension we're derivative of all of the behaviors and practices and rules of
*  cellular life we we bring to them our idiot idiosyncratic our unique ensemble
*  our human species specific ensemble of additions we're like variations on a
*  theme but the theme is so essential that we never get away we can't escape the
*  basic theme all that we can do is we assert it we embellish it we manifest it
*  in a slightly different day away so what are cells building us they unite
*  together to build the tissue ecologies that enable that form together that the
*  gut tissue ecology the pancreas tissue ecology the lung tissue ecology then
*  they all work together at the next level at the next scale to create us so what
*  does this mean in reverse it means that we can use if we become clever in our
*  research about cell cell communication and learning about how cells measure
*  together we can enlist their intelligence towards finding solutions
*  to a vast number of human diseases the solution of plastics in the environment
*  are probably going to be intelligent microbes and and so on so we're we're
*  going to have the new solutions we we will learn from cells how salamanders
*  regenerate a limb we don't know how but they we know they how they can it's
*  probable that we can too well we have to we're blocked from it for some
*  evolutionary reason which is yet to be discerned but this it's it's almost
*  certainly there in us and skill there are researchers that are doing a great
*  job there's Mike Levin up in Tufts was gonna ask you of his work yeah deeply in
*  fact he and I've talked about it a number of times he's doing critically
*  important research we will find those solutions so we will understand more
*  about the gradients the electrical bioelectrical gradients that are part
*  of it but they're not going to be the only part because cells the cells use
*  every imaginable cellular based tool in order to accomplish their problem
*  solving goals and so you can imagine the range of products that will be
*  available solutions to medical conditions I truly believe that when we
*  learn a great deal more about our microbiome we will find it at least
*  partial solutions to a great many of the chronic diseases that we just regard as
*  well I'm just getting old it just comes with the territory well frankly we know
*  that there are certain individuals that resist those things it means that it's
*  within all of us to be like that if we just had the key one of the things that
*  we're learning in diabetes for example I mentioned metformin is modulating the
*  gut microbiome we know that the microbiome of people with diabetes is
*  different compared to those that don't have that issue we do know that certain
*  probiotics and prebiotics seem to nudge the microbiome into a productive
*  direction it doesn't work equally well for every individual but we do know that
*  in general that's one additional pathway that is being discovered that can that
*  can help individuals towards living longer and healthier lives to greater
*  degrees of well-being we know microbes and this is almost frightening microbes
*  in many ways control our behaviors and personality it's a disturbing thing that
*  microbes can possibly affect whether or not you're depressed optimistic you're
*  just your general mood your outlook on life it seems for absurd but it's true
*  they they produce specific neurotransmitters serotonin is almost
*  totally dependent on a partnership between our gut cells and critical
*  microbes and without those critical microbes we wouldn't have the serotonin
*  levels that we have in the serotonin is considered one of those vital
*  neurotransmitters that that that assures that we keep a stable mental outlook so
*  we're smart enough now to know that we need to look we haven't developed all
*  the tools but we're clever enough and we will what why am I particularly optimistic because I think we will learn how to harness all these things because one of the things that the microbe learning more about cell cell communication and so on is we will be able to design
*  very clever sensors so I have one section of the book that readers made that
*  like it talks about a woman getting ready to prepare for her date in her 70s
*  because you know she's young she's only in her 70s my goodness I mean you know
*  it's just nothing and she's looking into a mirror and the mirror has a constant
*  set of sensors that's that that's assessing her general health and it
*  seems that must be science fiction but it's not really I'll tell you why you
*  can't see it but I'm surrounded by a microbial cloud I've actually got cells
*  of my own body cells are floating around it's an invisible signature and it's
*  very particular to me and how can I say that I mean I can't see it so first of
*  all can be measured with sensors now that we have but also you know everybody's
*  watched the movie where the bloodhounds track that the the guy that ran off the
*  chain gang I mean that's cool hand Luke these are old yeah yeah all these old
*  time movies but yeah yeah what what is it that bloodhounds are following they're
*  following your cells you're leaving a trail of cells billions of cells every
*  day everywhere you go can be if we had the fewer bloodhound we could track your
*  every movement how specific is it bloodhounds have the capacity to identify
*  every single individual so a twin to our eyes could be identical to a bloodhound
*  their individual the bloodhound can follow a trail for 50 or 100 miles two
*  weeks after you've left it is possible that researchers probably now it's
*  probably exists I don't have the exact machine but I've got my hands hovering
*  over my keyboard here I could probably leave this keyboard for a month and
*  researchers could come back be sent the keyboard if they had my microbial
*  signature they'd know it's bill Miller so this this kind of may make some people
*  a little queasy right but but people should be celebrating it instead of
*  feeling icky perhaps about it yeah I know I'm in the main I think it's a
*  celebration I'll tell you because it's a tool now that we know that we have this
*  kind of specific signature it means that if we were clever enough in
*  manipulating it we could get those people that live the longest that have
*  the healthiest lives and try to figure out why so I'm I've loved jogging my
*  whole life I've 50 plus years and I've been really lucky I don't have knee
*  problems I don't have hip problems and I have friends wonderful friends that
*  haven't jogged a mile in their whole life and they're crippled up they've got
*  total hips they've got total knees what's the sense of it what how why is
*  that well it it could be well we've talked about blood types we've talked
*  about luck we talked about microtrauma I'm just a very good runner well that's
*  ridiculous I'm a clumsy runner and I mean I'm just terrible athlete my only
*  merit is I keep at it because I like it but I like it because I'm not in pain so
*  the question becomes what is that crucial difference well in the ear of
*  the cell we're going to find out why and then what does that mean in the end it
*  means that people will be given a set of options that will allow them to take
*  advantage of some kind of modulation that will give them a better shot of
*  health and well-being across their life and probably a good deal longer life
*  than ordinarily what is what has been the the result of each of the prior
*  great medical revolutions revolutions more and more of the population gets a
*  pair a fair shot at a healthy happy life take something as mundane as
*  eyeglasses and contact lenses well I have poor eyesight and we're in contact
*  lenses guess what I'm even in another era I would be the blind guy in the
*  village I couldn't have hunted I couldn't I mean I I would walk into the
*  tree not I could see a game to fire or something and a bow and arrow or a gun
*  or anything I'm not I'm not suited for survival so given glasses and contact
*  lenses in that respect I'm even it's it's the same thing with someone with
*  heart failure when when people devised digitalis a couple hundred years ago
*  they started to find means of making people a little bit more even when they
*  might ordinarily have died prematurely same thing with smallpox vaccination and
*  so on treatments for TB the end result of each and every single medical advance
*  was a greater and greater possibility for each individual each average
*  individual to lead a healthy happy life not everyone gets that but better and
*  better probabilities on the whole and that that comes out with improved life
*  inspectancies and so on what will we get from the year of the cell we'll get a
*  much better overall life spinning out the next several decades we will find
*  the chronic diseases that I mentioned rheumatoid arthritis a diabetes
*  hypertension all of them will be either treated much better than they are today
*  or they will be cured and so you'll have a better shot at a longer healthier
*  life what else is one of their firms their ramification so we've talked about
*  engineering that'll be bioengineering that we bioengineered products
*  combinations of some kind of a synthetic manufactured lettuce and actual
*  cells that are working together in some kind of very intelligent way almost like
*  an intelligent robot that will help we talked about the possibility of
*  regeneration of organs regeneration of brain cells all all sorts of things like
*  that there will be much improved treatments for inflammation chronic
*  inflammation is one of the major causes of disease there's no question that
*  micro microbial dysfunction is one of the chief chief causes of this kind of
*  inflammation so if we learn how to tune our microbiome better we learned how to
*  cut down on inflammation when we when we use probiotics and prebiotics what
*  what's the common denominator for in most instances they improve what's called
*  the inflammation they just they just bring down the general level of
*  inflammation that is part and parcel of stress and that's one of the great
*  killers in modern society is just simply stress and that breaks down cellular
*  activities so what will we need to do to deliver this a new way of looking at
*  medicine so if you go to the doctor you have hypertension the doctor is going to
*  give you the range of pills for hypertension that almost everybody gets
*  it could be thiazides you know the things like that or could be a beta
*  blocker the thing is you're going to generally be approached as one size fits
*  all in the future we will have your personal signature some kind of a an
*  assessment of your metabolic profile which is very different from the crude
*  way that we go about it today and your microbiome and smart programs computer
*  programs will devise the probabilities that any one of these medications will
*  work well for you so what will be the first thing that will be used the first
*  thing that will be done is they'll try to adjust that microbiome so that you fit
*  the profile of people that don't have this problem pharmaceuticals rather than
*  being the first thing you get will become the thing that you get when the
*  other thing didn't work it's a complete reverse of where we've been in the past
*  and if this seems pretty far out it's not as far as you think if we gave as
*  much emphasis to understanding ourselves as we do trying to put somebody on Mars
*  we would we'd get a long way there much faster than we're ever going to get to
*  Mars because we're not going to Mars and I'm sorry to have such a long answer but
*  it's for me it's the most exciting topic in the world could it be that so let's
*  say I buy your premise that we're going to treat first line using microbial
*  microbiome adjustments using microbes could it be and and given that we have
*  our individual signature microbiomes and yet so so it could be seen as somewhat
*  miraculous that we have health at all because there's so many different
*  interactions going on but your premise is that these cells are working
*  intelligently together so could it be that there's a robustness and wide
*  range of self-organization that fits within a healthy profile so that it's
*  not that big a worry that introducing some set of microbes will throw off the
*  whole system right because it sounds a little scary mucking with a system that
*  has evolved over millions of years to be in this sort of nice cooperative state
*  and mucking with that sounds somewhat challenging or scary I suppose could
*  sound scary but but could it be that the the range of healthy interactions is is
*  just so wide the space of possible healthy interactions is is so wide that
*  there's a robustness there that might soothe our concerns absolutely that's
*  a great way to look at it we are blessed with resilience it's it's true with all
*  living things they're remarkably resilient to stress hmm and there's so
*  when I say that cells are problem-solving and that they band together
*  to solve problems together it's true but there are lots of solutions to problems
*  there that's that why are cells so intelligent is because they can see more
*  than one solution and they take advantage of more than one solution
*  given the opportunities the tools that they have available given the substrates
*  that they have so in cellular terms if they don't have the proper nutrients
*  that they're accustomed to one form of glue let's say you take a certain microbe
*  that's used to a certain form of glucose well you give them another form of
*  glucose another form of sugar and they'll they'll make a metabolic switch
*  that genes are tools yes genes are crucial there's they're absolutely vital
*  to whom we are and how we live and our lifespan it are important contributors
*  in ways we don't understand yet but they're just tools of the cell their
*  memory there there we've had an 80 year romance with genes and we've we almost
*  everyone assumes that your genes control your life well the era of the cell says
*  no yeah genes are like old tools yeah it's because they're not masters you know
*  if you take a gene and you take it outside of the cell that's inert it has
*  no it has no effect it is the cell that is the problem-solving entity it's an
*  organized whole and this is an important point because that's what all this
*  research is that we we need to do together the concept of the organized
*  whole I guess I suppose someone else would call it holistic but it really is
*  it's it's in the connections it's in and how all of the parts fit together if
*  you reduce if you do a reduction and you reduce it just to the molecules or you
*  would just you reduce it just to the cell cell signaling pathways you take
*  and if you knew all of those little individual moieties or parts of the whole
*  you still wouldn't understand it until you until you truly comprehended how
*  they all link together as an organized whole this is the vital secret that we'll
*  have to uncover it will take many decades to do that how is it that the
*  whole is more than the sum of its parts and it's a big debate in biology and in
*  evolution whether you can possibly understand things through reduction or
*  whether in doing that you destroy the the character of it and it's it's much
*  too complicated to go into today on our broad this broadcast by evolutionary
*  biology and and biology have argued about this for centuries exactly where
*  does that line lie and I'll tell you that we don't know where that line lies
*  but we do know that the reduction will destroy the essence of it and it's it's
*  not metaphysical it's just that we are much more than the sum of our of the
*  parts that's also true for human societies it shouldn't surprise us that
*  a collective action at the level of the halibut the super organisms of human
*  beings working together produce things that no individual in and of themselves
*  would ever conceive of or be able to do things emerge they emerge from the
*  processes themselves the connections themselves and that's the vital
*  principle that the ear of the cell concentrates on a bioverse the book
*  concentrates on we are embarking on a wonderful exploration of all of these
*  connections and so one of the things that we're going to learn is that we can
*  learn them it's yes it's complicated but here's a mysterious thing that we don't
*  get and and so you said is it frightening or not well it's intimidating
*  but it's exhilarating because for example in diabetes there are young
*  diabetics that do really well there are diabetics adult-onside diabetics and say
*  to get diabetes in their 30s and they live happily into their 90s we don't
*  know why why that subset we know statistically that there are risks for
*  cardiovascular disease and stroke and things like that but why are those
*  people immune but why are some people immune to heart disease virtually immune
*  so there's a village in Italy where the cholesterol levels are sky-high I mean
*  we're talking about double the cholesterol levels and if you measure
*  the number of the things the double there's no heart disease in that small
*  village and now of course they there are genetic markers and that may have
*  something important to do with it but there's more to it than than the genes
*  themselves and we we don't have those answers yet so what I'm getting at is
*  when I talk about individualized medicine and I'm mentioning that there
*  you're going to have much more specifically tailored solutions to your
*  problem ultimately decades from now when you go to the doctor there's one of the
*  there's one other freedom of action that comes from the ear of the cell the
*  recognition that your numbers don't have to re be perfect so you get your
*  chemistry 18 back and my god I've got three stars there and I'm scared to
*  death this is terrible that's terrible well actually there's another fraction
*  of life there the connections part of it that we really don't understand we just
*  know the book but the connections part of it is you could actually be quite
*  healthy and your numbers are not normal not exactly normal yeah again there's
*  there's this robustness this resilience that allows many solutions to the same
*  problem and so those exact chemistry profiles that your doctor would look at
*  and gravely tell you that you've got something that really is a little bit
*  alarming here and we're gonna have to go that may not be so for you as an
*  actual individual that's the difference between the then that was the before and
*  the future where we're going you will it will be much more nuanced and that will
*  be a certain freedom of action that we you I mean for example with the issue of
*  weight some people just do fine being overweight it's just it's really not a
*  health problem for them for others it's a crucial source of metabolic syndrome
*  with deterioration and with with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance and
*  hypertension and risks of renal failure and all the sorts of things that go with
*  metabolic syndrome to people they look the same when you're looking at them but
*  they're metabolically totally different and that's the difference of the ear of
*  the cell we were going compared to where we were going back to the idea of
*  DNA as a tool so you talk a lot about cell intelligence and you use words like
*  self-awareness that cells have some form of self-awareness and you know reading
*  it multiple times in the book because you keep coming back to the same theme
*  you know it makes me wonder how you view our own intelligence first of all so
*  what I would like you to do is compare what what you mean by cell intelligence
*  and self-awareness to what you mean what to how you think of human or organism
*  intelligence and self-awareness but then I also want to ask you do you consider
*  our intelligence as serving cells so is our intelligence a tool for cells like
*  DNA is a tool for cells yeah that's a terrific question okay what what does
*  cellular intelligence mean well I mentioned one things right they're
*  problem-solving how do we know that they're self-aware well we know that by
*  observation what what how what do I mean by that though it means that cells are
*  aware of the quality of information this sounds a little bit iffy a little bit
*  hard to understand what does it mean by that and this is actually really
*  important point cells know that their information is imprecise being out get
*  it yeah they get it you say what bill how do they get it how do they know that
*  I don't know that answer I don't even know why cells are smart I just know
*  that they are and they have been smart since the first competent cell about
*  three point eight billion years ago or maybe more it could be four point two
*  eight billion at the upper maximum but the point is the very first cell was
*  smart in its own way and what does that mean it was self-aware and what does
*  that mean it means that it knew that its information is imperfect and has to be
*  measured internally it also means that a cell knew that there are others that
*  measure like it did otherwise we wouldn't have had cellular cooperation how
*  do we know how do we know the origin this will sound digressive but it'll all
*  work back into one organized whole I promised how do we define the origin of
*  life how do we know when life began right well an individual cell is not
*  going to leave a fossil you can't it's just there's no way for each of fossil
*  eyes every bit of evidence that we have for the actual origin of life is based
*  on cells living together living contiguously with one another right
*  which implies absolutely at the cellular level cooperation collaboration and
*  codependence they've traded resources why do why do we know that cells are
*  self-aware because they'll trade resources for each other's benefit we
*  know that in a biofilm that's the the collection of microbes that are living
*  together to improve their chances and these biofilms are what actually cause
*  infectious disease in humans not individual microbes they have to band
*  together before they really become a problem so then these little microbes
*  microbial cities these biofilms these little microbial societies if there's
*  antibiotics floating around there might be some cells some microbes in that
*  biofilm that are resistant to the antibiotic and that resistance is
*  actually contributed by a viral companion that's living with and this is
*  how complicated the system is their own partnership with a virus it's living
*  inside the microbe and so this cell can determine to donate some of its genes
*  some of its like the viral gene to a cell that lacks resistance to the
*  antibiotic like the bacterial cell that lacks resistance so they can both get
*  through it together so this this is awareness awareness of status that a
*  cell is aware of its own status that's how it that's how it upholds itself
*  against an agitating environment it measures itself against that
*  environment and it assimilates the outside and upholds itself it knows that
*  others are like it and it trades resources freely with it and so that's
*  how cells are intelligent that's how we know they're intelligent we know they're
*  patterns of behavior just like we know humans are intelligent by their patterns
*  of behavior so how would you how would we rate cellular intelligence versus our
*  own well totally different I really don't think cells have egos in the way
*  we do I really doubt that they have abstractions they don't deliberate yeah
*  I mean as far as I know they don't get on tinder and try to attract their mates
*  I mean it's just they they they they live at their scale but here's our error
*  we impute we we regard our intelligence as intelligence it's right so look look
*  back at Darwin when Darwin was writing his crucial text in 1859 it was very
*  Victorian era so what is Darwinism it's not wrong by the way it's it
*  Darwin said two critically important smart things and deserves is the high
*  regard that he has as a scientist but it was still a very Victorian era and so it
*  was natural for the concept of survival of the fittest to resonate with a
*  Victorian male group of scientists it was the natural order it's not the way
*  the world actually works the world actually works through cooperation
*  compared to competition yes competition is fierce it's obvious you go on the
*  Serengeti plane you're going to see it but you you forget that when the lion is
*  taking down the wildebeest that's one-on-one and there's what there's
*  gonna be one winner and one loser but there are hundreds of trillions of cells
*  working together seamlessly in both of them to enable them to exist for this
*  moment for this final drama so where's our emphasis on the final drama where
*  do we put our emphasis on intelligence our kind of intelligence is how we
*  measure intelligence across the scale but that's not the way biology should
*  measure it and it's not the way evolution measures it so who's smarter
*  cells or humans well it depends it depends on the on the test Stephen
*  Hawking's is accredited with saying that intelligence is the ability to adapt to
*  change mm-hmm it's you might have said it I mean it's not a hundred percent sure
*  but it's a great way to put it it's it is a great way to consider
*  intelligence and so what does this mean bus for humans versus cells well cells
*  have been in continuous successful existence on this planet for billions
*  of years humans have lived on this planet as our kinds of of humans are
*  homo sapiens the estimates are somewhere between 200 and 300 thousand years
*  probably 300 thousand years and it isn't clear that we're gonna last another
*  300,000 given our personal type of intelligence so who is more intelligent
*  and what is biology's purpose well it's disturbing but you got to take the
*  evidence for what it is if cells have been continuously perennially successful
*  on this planet for billions of years then they are the purpose what are we
*  then we're solutions to problems for cells and we explore the environment in
*  ways that no other creature on this planet does and we bring back
*  information to ourselves we're communicating to them all the time we're
*  explorers of the planet and we are bringing information back to those basic
*  cellular lines and it's I know it's a very inverted way of looking at things
*  and it's going to take time for people to let this sink in because it just
*  seems almost perverse but that's the evidence we we are cellular beings and
*  our major purpose is exactly to be that to be cellular beings and to return
*  information back to the perpetual cells that dominate the planet as a shot to the
*  ego though it's terrible but here's here's an interesting thing here's an
*  interesting thing we're doing so this is just a thought experiment I'm not saying
*  this is absolutely correct but you know it's part of the evidence that exists
*  you just have to work with it so I've told you that cells are engineers and I
*  told you that we are what they've engineered we and every other creature
*  that you can see with our eyes I mean there we're not exceptional in that
*  regard we're just another engineered habitat this is crushing to metaphysicists
*  and and and many religious people and actually I don't think it's it's any
*  argument against religion it's just simply a different way of looking at it
*  it is possible for us to consider that how clever ourselves could they be
*  clever enough to create humans that are clever enough to send them into space to
*  give them an opportunity to explore the next environment beyond the planet now
*  you say well that's absurd well you say that but think of the evidence we've
*  done it we have sent microbes it wouldn't even know we're doing it you
*  know NASA had its clean rooms back in the 70s and they were scrupulous about
*  trying to just to make sure that there were no bad no bugs on the ships that
*  went to Mars and the initial probes that went out Voyager one and two that are
*  now past the heliosphere billions of miles away the idea was that they should
*  be sterile and they tested them very carefully and guess what the technology
*  was lousy and it turns out they were loaded with microbes and microbes are
*  adaptable and they some of them are termed extremophiles what means they can
*  actually survive in conditions that no human could even bear for a minute
*  temperatures that are well below zero enormously below zero or frighteningly
*  high they can they can endure radiation that no human being can they're just
*  some of them not all microbes some of them are very fragile but a lot of them
*  many of them especially those that are everywhere on the planet including
*  miles down below the Earth's crust or up in the stratosphere they're
*  everywhere some of them are very hardy inadvertently we've sent them out and so
*  maybe it's not an absurdity to say that how clever how smarter microbes clever
*  enough to have us send them out now it I'm not saying that's true I'm just
*  saying it is one way to interpret exactly what's happened and there's no
*  way to say absolutely it isn't true without misunderstanding the
*  particularities of microbial intelligence our intelligence and Darwin
*  actually saw this to Darwin was aware he didn't he really didn't think that that
*  he was thinking of animals specifically he had a very pluralistic viewpoint he
*  felt that it's it's a different in manifestation as opposed to kind and I
*  happen to agree with that I think that our form of intelligence is its own
*  specific I'd like the word idiosyncratic manifestation of all of the cellular
*  proclivities in and we also abstract things more I think we have an emergent
*  property that that is different from certain other animals but here's the
*  other disturbing thing plants are highly intelligent they are not just because
*  they don't move and just because we don't communicate with them in the ways
*  that we think we are the ways that we consider to be communication yeah plants
*  are quite intelligent they are they are highly adaptable they are solutions they
*  solve problems they form partnerships with microbes they form partnerships
*  among themselves if we really understood forests you'd realize that they're there
*  what you're seeing above ground is trivial compared to what's going on
*  underneath and all the connections that that are that that that are bring them
*  together into it's it's a complexities are well beyond a human city so we stand
*  on the threshold of actually learning about this and I think it's going to be
*  very important I think will ultimately impact how we look for extraterrestrial
*  intelligence not which I'm doubtful that I mean my point I'm aliens exist is that
*  what you're about to say I yes I am doubtful and I accept I would say only
*  one thing if if aliens exist I think they're intelligent and the reason for
*  that and I'm stealing this from a cartoonist how they're intelligent
*  because they haven't tried to contact us that's how smart they are they haven't
*  tried to reach us I mean we're too dangerous we're we're we're very
*  competitive as a life form but it's our we can just blame it on ourselves though
*  I'm gonna start blaming things on myself my up for my own day I do I like yes I
*  wrote an article once about my about the love for chocolate and my microbes made
*  me do it my basically yeah it was my punch line there the term intelligence
*  though is notoriously difficult for people to settle on a definition I mean
*  you just used Stephen Hawking's definition of to adapt what was it to
*  adapt to change change yeah yeah which which I think is a fairly common you
*  know definition of intelligence you know it just makes me wonder do we need
*  different words for you know microbial and that kind of intelligence versus
*  our kind of intelligence right in in any case you're I know that you're not an AI
*  expert but I'm sure you're well aware a well aware of the many impressive feats
*  that AI has undergone and you're talking about the era of the cell and a lot of
*  people I think would say it's the era of artificial intelligence because of this
*  recent revolution deep learning revolution and AI boom that's happening
*  right now maybe you know since I haven't done this yet I'll read a passage from
*  your book about AI and then I'd like to ask you you know just about your your
*  views on AI given your views on the cell artificial intelligence may ultimately
*  produce a robot that is so sophisticated it can easily fool a human observer into
*  believing that it is a living entity yet it will still not be alive no computer
*  engineer can devise that program without simultaneously understanding how to
*  create life which is the quote-unquote knowing internal state a state of doubt
*  artificial intelligence will always remain an artful facsimile of living
*  processes but it will not be alive so is life necessary for intelligence or what's
*  your view on creating artificial intelligence which obviously doesn't have
*  a microbiome although the computers probably do and you know obviously is
*  not alive so just you know 30,000 foot viewed how do you view the artificial
*  intelligence efforts and should should it be called intelligence I think it
*  should it is intelligence it is a tool intelligence is a tool we talk about
*  something as as simple as an intelligent thermostat we simply mean
*  that it assists us in solving a certain set of problems through programming but
*  here's the distinction in those forms of intelligence there's living intelligence
*  and there's computer intelligence so what are the two differences well the
*  very basic one has to do with the quality of information I'll explain if
*  you look at Shannon information that's this the basic mathematical construct
*  that's used for computers and there are many different types of computer
*  intelligence this algorithmic intelligence information and all sorts
*  of things but basically with Shannon information it's data it's bits and if
*  you look at though the waveform if you look at in your mind's eye and you
*  consider a waveform in in a computer the data spikes it has very
*  sharp margins it's a one or a zero it's triggered or it's not there's there's no
*  actual nuance within the flow of information it's the computer program
*  the computer logical processor that creates any nuanced answers that comes
*  out but the information itself is definitive its edges are sharp well
*  that's totally different in in biological information it's completely
*  different and never the two are will meet right now because in in biological
*  information it's a curve it's a sine wave and that curve means that the
*  information doesn't have sharp edges it has ambiguities and that's cute that's
*  living intelligence living intelligence is knowing that the knowing that the
*  data is imperfect I don't think any listener is going to say oh my computer
*  knows that the data that it's gotten is corrupted it doesn't know it it just
*  stops it's it's it's completely qualitatively different living things
*  even cells know the quality of their data is limited and that explains
*  biology and that's the bio verse the book explains to you why that particular
*  principle is so crucial to biology so what does that mean with respect to the
*  concept of an AI that's alive well we the programmers would have to figure out
*  how to create that sense of internal knowing but here's the problem we don't
*  know how that's done we don't know why that is so within cells we don't know
*  why that's the living principle hence if you are able to do it as a computer
*  program you have to have created life and I'll tell you there isn't the
*  slightest prospect that that's going to happen I mean that's talk about science
*  fiction that's way out in the future but you can design probabilistic programs
*  right so you know even learning yes yeah yeah so it comes out with probabilities and then you soft
*  max it to pick the right answer right yeah exactly but it never overcome so a
*  intelligent nuanced human designer figures out a program that allows a a
*  computer that knows no doubt to mimic doubt human doubt so I was talking with
*  colleague and I said he asked me about the touring test the touring test is that
*  is the concept by the genius Alan Turing that we would consider a computer to be
*  intelligent if it could fool someone into believing that it was another
*  living person a person that couldn't wasn't seeing the computer but having a
*  conversation with it and if the conversation was so satisfying computer
*  to human that the human thought it was talking to another human that it would
*  have passed the intelligence test well it would have it would have definitely
*  passed the concept of intelligent computer programming test and there's
*  any doubt in my mind that we will create I AI's that are so intelligent that they
*  routinely fool even very perceptive people to believe in that they're alive
*  they will it that it will but it will simply be a facsimile it will be a
*  basically an engineering feat a trick because that being that you're talking
*  to is still programmed and it has no doubt it won't be irrational you can you
*  say we could program in a rationality no no part part part of being and is doubt
*  part of ambiguity part of uncertainty is that sometimes you do the thing that
*  doesn't make any sense we each do it not me we know we do it actually ourselves
*  do it less than right then humans and and animals animals animals are much
*  more sensible in fact I like to say that the thing that separates us from all
*  other animals is that we're the only one that's capable of actual irrational
*  action over and over again we we are it's almost a form of intelligent
*  perversion we will sometimes do the craziest things there they're even if a
*  panther could figure out how to skydive it wouldn't it just it just wouldn't do
*  it it's that just there's no there's no panther that leaps out of a tree to the
*  ground and says oh I just did it for fun yeah that's just not it's just not how
*  they as an intelligent collection a collection of ecologies of cellular
*  ecologies they're just not put together that way that's not their form of
*  intelligence I really do think we have a very specific form of human
*  intelligence I don't think we understand it very well but I tell you absolutely
*  it is nonetheless absolutely to derivative of cellular intelligence and
*  trying to understand it means we have to understand how we are that special
*  combination of of cells that enable us to to engineer better than any other
*  creature on the planet and to do so in ways that are are highly clever utilizing
*  abstract thought in ways that other animals and plants can't you're not
*  you're not worried about a super intelligent AI taking over the world and
*  destroying us and stuff I think the possibility of of aggressive AI is
*  certainly exists that's obvious no again it would have to be programmed it would
*  be the individual behind it that is is the force the the computer itself is not
*  going to do it and therefore it's the cells the cells will have made the AI
*  that takes us over here's I actually here's here's a possibility and and
*  actually this is being worked on in labs already all over the world it is
*  possible that I'll be contradicted about AI insofar as it will be a
*  synthetic combination of living cells that are part of a computer matrix and
*  done in a very clever way that I can't currently imagine but I think it's it
*  it's conceivable that you could get that quasi living combination that somehow
*  leverages the living circumstance of being a stout with the precise
*  information utilization of a computer and together it becomes a a different
*  life form a living synthetic life form and that possibly could satisfy but
*  again that there would be some living thing to it would not be just a computer
*  in and of itself right yeah I had a I mean this these sorts of ideas are rife
*  for science fiction and I've had a few of these ideas I need to get writing but
*  so okay I know you're not a neuroscientist but so a lot of what we
*  talk about here on the podcast is use so AI is interesting in that its birth was
*  really because of what we knew what they knew about neuroscience at the time and
*  like the the units in deep learning networks are inspired by the neurons
*  spiking artificial neurons right make up these layered deep learning
*  architectures and right now in computational neuroscience there's a
*  lot of excitement and work being done using the deep learning architectures
*  and AI architectures to try to understand how our brains are functioning
*  the way that they do do you have thoughts on whether that is a wise or
*  prosperous endeavor or would we be missing something crucial by analyzing
*  our own intelligence using the intelligence of the artificial systems
*  that we have built no I think we could leverage all of our tools I don't have
*  any problem with that I would say that there is one major obstacle in a
*  neuroscience research it's not universal there I think it's beginning to break
*  down from a prior prejudice and that is it was and it was it's natural that you
*  start with the concept of exclusive human intelligence and you begin with the
*  concept that only humans are intelligent that was a big prejudice for very
*  long time which is fading yeah true it wasn't very long ago that it was
*  absolutely believed and we're only talking decades that only humans had
*  real intelligence all other creatures were just basically a robust automatons
*  like really fancy robots but anyone with a dog knows that that dog's
*  intelligence and has feelings and emotions no my dog but okay well my dog
*  did what's wrong with your dog dumb as a rock I'm sorry we love her so my my dog
*  was pretty stupid too but she's she was very sweet she was she could be smart at
*  certain moments sure and but certainly emotional absolutely very emotional
*  maybe that was one of the reasons she could be annoying my cycles her own biome
*  quite quite a bit oh no yeah it's awful what you mean I think I know what you
*  mean my sister has that same dog oh my she had she's been unable to break it
*  too we couldn't we get we've given up yeah oh goodness anyway that so the
*  neuroscience approach had been from top down yeah you take what you know about
*  human intelligence you what you believe about human superiority and then you
*  believe further that only humans have real sentience so there's in there's
*  consciousness there's cognition and their sentience they none of them are
*  formally defined no one really understands what consciousness is no one
*  we're all working to some kind of common definition but here's the thing that we
*  and my colleagues insist upon and in a book we're writing for Oxford University
*  Press that all cells have all of the capacities that we grant ourselves
*  hmm they're cognitive that means they measure information they're aware of
*  those measurements they are sentient they they have they're not feelings the
*  way we have feelings but they have states of preference which is why bugs
*  go to the same spot and the human body over and over again to wreak their
*  particular particular havoc that's why you can get liver to you know and viral
*  infections of the liver or viral infections of the brain or hemophilus
*  goes to the lung and very rarely goes to any other body parts and so on there
*  there are bugs that go everywhere like TB can notoriously go up here but it
*  tends to affect lungs more than anything else so cells are sentient and
*  I think in order to actually come to create a robust program it's not just
*  humans top-down and trying to work from it from the point of view on how
*  computer programs can help us understand human intelligence from top down I think
*  that if you use that computer programming and you you work hard to
*  figure out how it sells up that's how it's cellular the basics of cellular
*  intelligence work their way into human type of intelligence I think it would be
*  more productive let me explain one specific aspect in support of that I'm
*  sure you know about the hard problem of intelligence for those that are not
*  consciousness of consciousness yes thank you for those that are not familiar with
*  it you you can consider consciousness and into two kind of aliquots two types
*  of portions there's one portion which is called by a brilliant guy named Chalmers
*  was called the easy problem that's how do we know that something is cold or hot
*  or fast or slow or bright or dark that's connections that's like the
*  quantitative aspect enough information reaches us we assess it as a specific
*  experience but then there's another realm of experience which is much harder
*  to define so for example if I hit a hammer on my thumb I see red you heard
*  that expression to see red what is that what where does that come from that
*  seems very much more mysterious and that's called the hard problem and this
*  is really seduced a couple of generations of neuroscientists it seems
*  like a terrific idea the only problem is there's no reason for it if you
*  understand that cells are intelligent and why they're intelligent then you
*  realize that that's just a human way of categorizing things because it's
*  satisfying but cells have all the apparatus for feelings of all different
*  kinds they're surrounded by an intelligent membrane the plasma
*  membrane the outside of the membrane and every single bit of information that can
*  come into a cell that a cell has has to go through it so a cell doesn't know one
*  bit of information that it hasn't produced this is a difficult concept
*  what do I mean by that and a surprising conclusion comes from this there's no
*  way that information can go from outside of a cell to get to the inside of cell
*  without crossing that membrane and there's no way any information any
*  environmental cue can reach a cell without a delay in time having to travel
*  through the the separations between cells and the fluid matrix that's
*  between them and so on and so on all of those things create information
*  degradation it's noisy inside a cell also because it's a very packed
*  environment filled with tools for cellular life so that's part of this
*  information ambiguity this doubt that I'm talking about the cell never gets
*  perfect information if there was a perfect source of data they could never
*  know it and the only information they have always has to travel across all of
*  these barriers get through this the membrane the the plasma membrane and
*  then get inside and get measured through an internal process which is itself
*  noisy what does this mean it means that a cell is producing the actual
*  information it has it's derivative of what's on the outside but it is
*  self-generated on the inside a cell only knows what a cell produces the
*  information it produces it the derivative information that it produces
*  this is not conjectural this is an absolute requirement of cellular life
*  just go look at a cell it's it's actually quite obvious when you look at
*  it what does that mean it means that we ourselves as human beings are a
*  constellation an enormous constellation of self-produced information there is no
*  external absolute reality it's only our interpretation of it we we agree on
*  what reality looks like this because we're all species human we're all
*  humans so in general we all evaluate all external cues in a self-similar
*  web matter this this issue of self-similar is really important why do
*  we know that cells are intelligent because they know that others experience
*  things in the same way and they'll trade resources because of it what does that
*  mean for us we internally devise our own world our own reality of external
*  informational inputs and as it happens because of our architecture our
*  information management systems to human to human they're all alike we tend to
*  produce the same interpretation of reality except for the small minority of
*  us that don't and they are always the people that we say well we live in this
*  own world what can I say he sees it differently I mean you always shrug but
*  there's a real good reason for it it's a condition of life that can never ever be
*  otherwise so your interpretation of reality is is exactly that there's you
*  don't have a connection to the external reality that's any more robust than the
*  next person you've you may agree with the next person in in general construct
*  but you each cell constructs its own reality and then it communicates that to
*  other cells and together they average these things that's a wisdom of crowds
*  and they produce biological outputs that's us and what do we do we take to
*  us ourselves and then we agree on a certain set of reality and we form
*  collective actions we engineer together we build buildings together we
*  have collective societies we we institute governments and we don't get
*  along with each other because we're all living on our own reality and this is
*  not even conjectural it's just basic biology but we just didn't know that
*  until a very short time ago the book is bio verse how the cellular world
*  contains the secrets to life's biggest questions and we touched on you know a
*  few topics from the book but we only skim the surface I mean you go into
*  in biology and populating the universe with our microbes and just tons and tons
*  of really well-informed examples of our microbiomes and different kinds of
*  microbes and how they affect our cognition and not just through the gut
*  and like you mentioned before you know how our brain which because of the
*  blood-brain barrier was thought to be completely sterile has its own although
*  smaller microbiome which I don't know how to think about that whether that's
*  good or bad but anyway I hope that people check out the book and I
*  appreciate the conversation today thanks for being on it's been a pleasure
