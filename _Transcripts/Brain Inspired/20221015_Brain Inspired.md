# BI 150 Dan Nicholson: Machines, Organisms, Processes
**Brain Inspired:** [October 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTFvy3opnjk)
*  I like to think of philosophy as a set of tools that you can apply to any discipline,
*  right? And that in any discipline, if you start thinking carefully about the nature of that discipline,
*  you're going to end up doing philosophy anyway.
*  It's useful, but that doesn't mean it's true. I mean, sometimes we conflate these, right?
*  So it is almost the burden is on me to explain, I mean, if I'm going around telling people that this is a bad way of thinking about organisms,
*  then the first question I'm going to get is why are we still using it if it's so terrible?
*  Basically, what I want to do is try to listen to attend to what physics tells us, instead of engineering.
*  And what does physics tell us? Well, it tells us that organisms are flows of energy and matter.
*  So I'm not naive enough to think that we can get away without using any metaphors, okay?
*  Even though I'm very critical of the machine metaphor, I recognize the metaphors are indispensable.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hey, everyone. I'm Paul, and that was Daniel Nicholson. So Daniel is a philosopher at George Mason University.
*  And I say philosopher, but he's just as much a historian, really, as a philosopher.
*  Dan considers it essential to understand the historical roots and traces of the philosophical issues that keep cropping up again and again,
*  often without acknowledging that these ideas are old and that many bright people have already addressed them.
*  And we should pay attention to the work of those bright people rather than reinvent the wheel again and again.
*  So we talk about Dan's approach. We talk about process philosophy,
*  the notion that a better way to understand our universe is as a collection of processes rather than a collection of things or substances.
*  We discuss Dan's work arguing against what he calls the machine conception of the organism.
*  And that's the view that we understand organisms mechanistically and reductively, like machines,
*  much like the computer metaphor of the brain that you're probably familiar with if you listen to this podcast.
*  And we dance around a bunch of other subjects like his interest in artificial life,
*  which is part of the full episode available to Patreon supporters.
*  You can learn how to support the podcast and the different bells and whistles that come with that through the website at braininspired.co.
*  And you can also find the show notes there at braininspired.co.slash podcast slash 150.
*  I also link to Dan and his works. All right.
*  Enjoy Dan. Dan, we were just talking about our academic histories and you're a ex molecular biologist turned.
*  Would it be right to say biological philosopher, philosopher of biology?
*  Yeah. Or you could even broaden that up even more to historian and philosopher of biology. I do sort of integrate with HPS as it's called.
*  HPS. Yeah. So I was telling you about my decision to quit academia and how I did not turn to philosophy like you did, but perhaps I should have.
*  And, you know, I said I was in a postdoc. My postdoc lasted about six years. You said yours was about you did ten years worth of postdocs.
*  Yeah, about that. Almost almost a decade. And I mean, I enjoy, of course, having the autonomy to do whatever I wanted.
*  I mean, even when I was part of a funded project, I still had reasonable amount of leeway to pursue that project however I wanted.
*  So that was really good. But yeah, it was obviously very unnerving to not know where I would be next.
*  And so I did my first my first postdoc was was the KLI was in near Vienna in Austria.
*  It's this sort of Institute for Advanced Studies where basically you come and you can do whatever you want.
*  And it's a wonderful place. You got all these resources, wonderful spaces to work, library, funding to travel.
*  You need to stay in the lab for your molecular biology. You got to stay in the lab, man.
*  Well, no, I mean, so the story of me leaving the lab comes much earlier. I thankfully learned really early on that it wasn't for me.
*  I mean, I enjoy I love biology. I love molecular biology. I'm interested, always been interested in something, you know, life, the nature of life.
*  And that inevitably led me from higher organisms to lower organisms and ended up doing molecular biology because those were, I guess, the simplest, the simplest point to begin that process of understanding life.
*  But yeah, I just did not enjoy the lab work at all. I found it extremely tedious.
*  You had to be very good with your hands. And I was always like, that's lagging behind.
*  Everyone else was in the practicals, the seven, those horrible seven hour practicals.
*  And in my degree, I just was always behind. And I wanted to talk about this stuff, you know, discuss the issues.
*  And I noticed that the people just don't really do that. At least they don't do that when they're working in the lab.
*  They might do that when they go out for a drink after. And I figured, well, wouldn't it be lovely to be able to do to do that all the time?
*  You know, the stuff that these people do, these scientists do, you know, after when they take a speaker out for dinner or when they're reflecting, right?
*  Wouldn't it be great to be able to just spend most of your time doing that? And I didn't even know there was a discipline called philosophy of science or anything like that.
*  Isn't that crazy that so many scientists have no purchase on philosophy at all?
*  I know. And it's such a shame because it's a discipline that is by its very nature, right, interdisciplinary. And it needs the input, right?
*  You need to know the science. It's, I think, targeted to scientists. I mean, we're not doing a good job if we're only talking to each other, right?
*  Of course, we have our own journals and we are the ones who are reading each other's work.
*  But ultimately, there has to be some contact with, you know, with the scientists. Not everyone agrees, by the way.
*  Some people think that it's perfectly fine to have this sort of second order discussion, which is completely divorced from what's going on.
*  Like, you know, we're commenting on what other people are doing. But I've never I never bought that.
*  I always thought that the whole point of me doing this work is that in some way, hopefully in the long term, I can have some influence on what on the actual science.
*  I guess the reason why I think that is because I don't really think of myself as doing something completely different from science.
*  Maybe you can think of philosophy of science as doing science by other means.
*  You're not in a lab, but you're still thinking. You're reading the literature. You are doing you can do critical work, right?
*  You don't have to be commenting on what others are doing. You can take a stand, you know, have a seat at the table, engage in the debates that are going on in the science.
*  And if you if you talk to them and you publish in their outlets, then there's no reason why philosophers of science can't contribute.
*  And many of us have a science background anyway. Yeah. So I don't see why.
*  You know, it's like it's like what theoretical biology used to be.
*  So I'm interested at the moment I'm doing an engagement, a project looking at the history of this discipline.
*  And it's very interesting because most people have a terrible opinion of theoretical biology because it's associated with mathematical models of particular biological concepts.
*  And it's a very difficult process. And usually the mathematics comes first, as it were.
*  And most biologists were very practically minded, very experimentally minded, don't see the relevance of theoretical biology.
*  And it's such a shame because if you go back to the beginning of the 20th century, a hundred years ago, when the discipline got going, it was all about, you know,
*  Discussion of ideas and theories and their relation. It's all the stuff that we philosophers are doing now.
*  So maybe it's time to take back, reclaim theoretical biology as something that can be as useful to biology as theoretical physics is to physics, you know, a discipline that can provide some sort of foundation where you don't, you know, you don't learn necessarily through doing experimental work.
*  But you can and you don't even need to do math, right? It can be sort of non-formal theoretical work, conceptual clarification, these kinds of things.
*  Is that philosophy or is that theory? What's the?
*  Well, that's the nice thing about it. I mean, when you are not able to distinguish them, I think we're going somewhere, right?
*  Well, we're going to say, well, is this philosophy? Is this theory?
*  Well, this is exactly the kind of space that philosophers or biologists should be taking, you know, the space where it's not clear, the space where it is,
*  it is beneficial to have someone, one of us, right? Among a group of biologists, right?
*  Because even though we're trained differently, we can still contribute to those sorts of discussions.
*  You know, biologists need us, right? They need a clarification. We have no idea, for example, how to define a gene, right?
*  We have no understanding about what level of description we should focus on when trying to explain complex phenomena.
*  So it's not like something, you know, they're doing philosophy anyway, right? They just are not aware of it.
*  Why not just, you know, take us for a helping hand from those of us who may be able to provide some assistance?
*  You've mentioned that you, you know, read the literature. How much of the literature that you're reading is biology and how much philosophy?
*  What's the ratio?
*  It's a good question. Depends on the on the projects I'm engaged in. To be brutally honest with you, I don't find much of philosophy all that interesting, I have to say.
*  Ouch. We can edit that out. We'll edit that out. I'm just kidding.
*  That's fine. I mean, philosophy is such a weird discipline because it's not, I just don't even see it as a discipline.
*  It's, you can have philosophy of everything, right? Philosophy of art, philosophy of history, philosophy of music, philosophy of science, philosophy of what you've got.
*  Anything, right? And plus, of course, ethics, aesthetics, you know, metaphysics, epistemology.
*  So I like to think of philosophy as a set of tools that you can apply to any discipline, right?
*  And that in any discipline, if you start thinking carefully about the nature of that discipline, you're going to end up doing philosophy anyway.
*  So, you know, you could imagine a world where philosophy departments dissipate, right?
*  Or if they don't disappear, they become grossly reduced. And what happens is philosophers of law end up talking to people practicing law, philosophers of politics end up talking to, you know, and you could imagine that situation, right?
*  And a few people are in, you know, a few of my colleagues are in biology departments, for example.
*  And I know philosophers of physics sometimes are housed in physics departments.
*  And I think that wouldn't be a terrible thing if that happened, right?
*  Because when I think about the work that my colleagues do in my department, I mean, it's an extremely diverse department as philosophy departments tend to be, right?
*  It's also boring. Your colleagues work.
*  I don't want to say that, but it's difficult for me to find points of contact, right?
*  I mean, what do I have in common, right?
*  Whereas if I'm in a biology context, right, I may not be doing the experiments, right?
*  But I am able to ask interesting questions and to learn a great deal from what the kind of work that they're doing.
*  So in that sense, you know, huge swathes of philosophy are just not, I mean, at least in the research level, right?
*  When I'm teaching, of course, it's different.
*  I'm not, frankly, I'm not reading that stuff.
*  Obviously, I wouldn't be able to anyway, right, if I wanted to do this kind of work with interdisciplinary.
*  So, you know, in some projects that I've done, it's been almost all science and in others, it's been mostly philosophy, right?
*  It also depends on the target audience of what I'm writing.
*  I've tried to be very deliberate and very intentional and clear in my mind before I start writing.
*  Am I right? What I'm going to write? Is this going to be consumed by philosophers or biobiologists or by historians?
*  You know, so really that that will determine how I use my time.
*  When's the last time you walked into a wet lab and who does consume?
*  Are you making that difference in science? Are you connecting with the scientists?
*  Last time I did any lab work was.
*  No, just walk. I'm just thinking like afterward, you know, walking into a wet lab, what it must feel like that you're free.
*  Yeah, no. I so many of my colleagues are very skeptical that philosophers or science can actually make a difference.
*  They have a pretty pessimistic view. But honestly, that hasn't been my experience.
*  I've had a great experience with scientists. I've always found scientists, for the most part, interested, you know, and almost like amazed because, of course, they don't know that there are people like me doing this kind of work.
*  And so they. Yeah, but how do you kind of just try to brush you off?
*  You know, like, I mean, it does happen, but not as common, not as often as many philosophers say it happens.
*  Right. It doesn't happen that often. I mean, what they want, what scientists want to know, first of all, is that you're not talking out of your backside, that you know what you're talking about.
*  And if they if you make if you show any indication that you can follow the conversation that you that you are reasonably scientifically literate, then then my experience is that they've all often been interested in what I have to say.
*  Now, of course, the sorts of questions that you get in the Q&A at the end of a talk when the talk is delivered in a biology department, say, are very different from the sort of questions that I get in a philosophy department.
*  Right. So philosophers are trained to think critically, to, you know, to scrutinize every argument.
*  Right. So at the end of any philosophy colloquium, you're going to get people who are going to try to disagree with you.
*  Right. Even if they actually don't disagree with you because they're just trying to test the argument.
*  You know, you may know for a fact that your friend standing sitting in front of you agrees with you.
*  But there they are in public now trying to destroy your argument and they're doing you a service.
*  You know, that's how it's understood in philosophy. It's a good thing because they're giving me the opportunity to think more carefully about how I would defend the argument and how I would respond to objections that may come up.
*  So that's considered to think about that. That's even considered a service.
*  Well, that's the same as science. That's the same between scientists.
*  There's a similarity there. But as a biologist, a philosopher in a science department, perhaps it's different.
*  I mean, my experience talking to scientists is actually that some scientists don't necessarily expect that to be sort of conflict.
*  I'm speaking sort of secondhand. Also, it happens in the papers.
*  So I've had experiences of scientists being upset when they when they read a paper that just come out.
*  There's this this kind of this, you know, criticizing their work was a philosopher is delighted because it gives you the opportunity.
*  So I mean, maybe there's a cultural difference there, maybe not.
*  But the point is that if I then give a talk to a science audience, then the questions are going to be all like, OK, that's fantastic.
*  Very interesting and got me thinking in any way. But how do I translate this into something I can actually do implement in my lab?
*  How does this matter to my work? And that's a question that never comes up, you know, in philosophical with philosophical audience.
*  It's kind of nice to to always remind yourself that the kind of stuff that one does, if you want to be, you know, to have an impact or or be read by scientists,
*  you have to never forget that there has to be some sort of payoff that can be something that can be implemented practically, which which is the same.
*  Most philosophers don't ever worry about.
*  Do you prefer that sort of feedback, those that that biological Q&A?
*  Like, how can I apply this? Or is it more challenging? And is that better or worse?
*  It's more challenging because I'm not I'm not that interested in.
*  Well, I mean, of course, I'm interested, but that's not what I'm doing. Right.
*  I mean, I see this division of labor. Right.
*  I like to think about conceptual problems.
*  I hope that you as a scientist can find a way to to draw on those reflections in your work.
*  I feel a little bit it's a bit odd for me to to tell the scientists what they should do.
*  I don't know enough. Right. It seems like I'm out of my depth.
*  If they ask me, you know, OK, how do you how do you adopt a process perspective in the lab?
*  OK, so that's all questions relating to my work.
*  So it can be very challenging.
*  And I know I don't always have a good answer to those kind of questions.
*  So, you know, you've talked about reading a lot of literature.
*  I know that you read a lot of historical literature because history is almost central to your philosophical endeavors.
*  Why is that? And then I really want to know like how you.
*  Choose what to read, how you your path in reading the history, how do you mine for these ideas that are connected to what you're trying to write about?
*  Well, I mean, for me, it's always seemed natural when thinking about science to to to think about the evolution of the ideas that I'm dealing with.
*  So it's almost unnatural.
*  I mean, I could almost throw the question back at the sort of a historical analytic philosophers who don't really care about history.
*  And how can you possibly think about causation or think about, you know, emergence or mechanism without looking at how that debate has unfolded over time?
*  It seems almost I mean, it's it's it's naive.
*  It seems almost why arrogant, right?
*  Well, because because there's a huge number of people who have thought about those same issues, probably smarter than us, right?
*  We'll have a great deal that we can learn from.
*  Right. Maybe the specific context, of course, is different.
*  And we obviously depending on the question, the question is, is narrowly formulated than than maybe much of the history of science is not that relevant, right?
*  Because they didn't know what we know now.
*  But the last several questions don't tend to be very narrow, right?
*  They tend to be quite general and conceptual. Right.
*  So so there you essentially have an entire sort of cemetery, right?
*  Of forgotten ideas waiting to be rediscovered, dug up and cleaned and reused.
*  Because obviously the alternative is just to continuously reinvent the wheel, which we do, which unfortunately happens.
*  And so I've always had that sensibility towards history.
*  And I think that I mean, I can't imagine doing philosophy of biology without also doing history of biology because it helps me situate the debate that I'm engaging in.
*  It also reminds me that the way we are addressing a problem is not inevitable.
*  The way we're addressing it now is not inevitable.
*  It's a consequence of of contingency choices that were made at particular times that there is there are a number of different ways we can think about an issue.
*  Right. And often these have already been explored historically.
*  And so I'm never I'm different from a historian because, of course, historians are interested in the history for its own sake.
*  Right. They're interested in narratives.
*  You know, you read a history paper and it begins like, you know, the October 4th, 1863, this person.
*  And that's not how philosophers think. Right.
*  Philosophers try to solve problems. Right.
*  But the history there comes in by, I say, as I say, affording us maybe forgotten strategies to deal with those problems.
*  Right. And so I think in that sense, it's extremely helpful.
*  And the answer to your question about how to know what to read.
*  Well, you just do just follow the is it just the same?
*  Because if I want to learn about process philosophy, I can go to your book.
*  Everything flows right and read your chapter.
*  And then you already have all the history laid out.
*  Do you know the band Teenage Fan Club?
*  No. OK.
*  I think it's a UK band kind of old.
*  Maybe I think I'm older than you.
*  But they have this this what my favorite song by them is Everything Flows back when they were a good band anyway.
*  So I really like the title of that book.
*  But but if I want to learn about the history, I can just go to your chapter in the book.
*  Everything Flows.
*  And so what you just said is that you just kind of follow the dots.
*  But are the dots laid?
*  So in less like in neuroscience or biology, you can do that more easily, it seems.
*  But these buried ideas, it's not necessarily the case that the dots have been connected through time already.
*  Right. Well, the thing is that if you read my chapter and you're interested in the evolution of the ideas that I'm discussing, you may not necessarily agree with the survey that I offer.
*  I mean, any historical survey is an incredible subjective act of selection of sources.
*  You innumerable sources are suddenly all it's all boiled down to a couple of pages.
*  Right. Not only that, but you know how I discuss them, how I connect them.
*  It's you could have a hundred or a thousand people looking at the same sources and they would all come with a different account.
*  So in that sense, you don't have to trust.
*  Take my word for it. You know, I'm also using history.
*  It's always it's always a means to an end. Right.
*  So if you have a different agenda, you may look at the authors that I'm looking at in a different way.
*  Right. So the question is, well, which of the two interpretations is right?
*  Historians often for that reason are quite unhappy with philosophers like me digging their noses into their history because, you know, for one thing, they think that they have that they own history.
*  And I completely disagree with that.
*  I think that it's their turf and we shouldn't we shouldn't, you know, try to to to make intrusions there.
*  I totally disagree with that.
*  I totally disagree with that. I think that history belongs to all of us, including scientists, and that we all benefit from from context, you know, from understanding because, you know, the answers may be there.
*  I mean, what you want to say, which may be, you know, 2022 may in some sense already be encapsulated in ideas that were proposed decades, if not centuries ago.
*  And I have happened to me.
*  I mean, when I was doing my my Ph.D., I discovered this this basically this this movement, this intellectual movement in the interwar period, the 1920s, 1930s of authors in different countries who were developing a view of the organism, which was the view that I wanted to defend.
*  The organist.
*  Yeah, the organist is right.
*  So the view that I wanted to defend in the context of 21st century discussions was a view that had been developed by very, very smart people that have been completely forgotten for a number of interesting reasons.
*  A hundred years ago.
*  Right.
*  And so me reading this work is almost more valuable than reading the literature that is being published today.
*  Oh, wow.
*  OK, of course.
*  You know, they didn't they didn't know this, but look at how they look how they addressed it.
*  Right. And so I see a lot of my work is trying to essentially revive this movement, which, of course, is a cycle.
*  Right. Because they thought they saw themselves as reviving earlier scholars.
*  Right. And it goes it goes on and on.
*  So, you know, in that sense, we're all part of this of this grand conversation and this analytic sort of Anglo American, you know, culturally this this this this this way of doing philosophy where one thinks that history is completely irrelevant.
*  One should only focus on argument, I think, is a little bit myopic because it's I don't know.
*  It's like you're choosing not to avail yourself of all these other resources that that are there.
*  So I have to ask you about this because we're talking about history and it's a total aside.
*  But speaking of history, you recently ran into James Watson, co-founder of that's right.
*  DNA. And I just want to know what that it was in the context of you giving a talk about Schrodinger's What is Life and yeah, and his views on the gene and order from disorder, etc.
*  So we don't have to go down a long road on this, but maybe you can just talk about the context of meeting him and then what the interaction was like.
*  You had like a picture with him, I think, too. Right. That's right.
*  I mean, I'm happy to go down this road. This is actually what I'm currently working on.
*  So it's the freshest in my mind. Okay. So essentially, I'm engaged right now in a reappraisal of this really famous book, Schrodinger's What is Life that is taken to be right.
*  One of the most influential, well-known books of, you know, popular science in the 20th century.
*  And that you claim that no one reads, but I've read at least a paragraph or two of it.
*  No, no. I mean, I so I think that people might read it. But what's striking to me is that I was initially the idea was just to write some sort of short essay commemorating the 75th anniversary of its publication, which would have been 2018.
*  Right. And then when I looked at look back at the book and at the argument, I noticed that the argument was super interesting.
*  The argument that Schrodinger puts forward for why he thinks that the order of the cell is based on this a priori crystal.
*  We didn't even know that it was DNA, but you know, turned out to be DNA, right? There's hereditary material.
*  And, you know, there's a huge amount of secondary literature on Schrodinger, like hundreds, literally hundreds of papers have been collected.
*  Right. People even, you know, when the title of the paper reappraised Schrodinger, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  And yet no one seen. I've only found three people who actually engage right with what the argument is about.
*  Right. And so I figured, wow, this is kind of interesting.
*  So so I've devoted the last year and a half more thinking about this.
*  I'm writing a short book reappraising this this part of the book.
*  Right.
*  Probably the book will be as short as the original.
*  And and it's actually very interesting because I think that in that argument, we have we sort of have the key to why it is that for more than half a century,
*  molecular cell and molecular biologists have been sort of an obsessed with with a particular kind of view of the cell with a sort of clockwork engineering machine view of the cell.
*  So this is something that I've written about earlier.
*  And so doing this project, a historical project, by the way, so it relates to what we're talking a moment ago, gives me an understanding of why it is that people think the way they do.
*  Right. If I if you know, I can answer your question again about why, why does history matter?
*  If I didn't do this history, I would I would be able to tell you why I think they're wrong.
*  Right. But I wouldn't be able to tell you why it is that they think this is the standard way of thinking about the cell.
*  Why they should think they're wrong.
*  They should at least understand where they're coming from.
*  You know, who it is that came up with those ideas that those ideas are not inevitable.
*  You know, that nature is not telling us that we need to understand it in a machine way.
*  OK. And the particular choices were made at particular times that led to this research program called Molecular Biology that that takes for granted that this is the way the cell is.
*  Right. And so that's why I'm motivated to look at to dig into this history and understand why this is showing the argued the way he did.
*  And it's a fascinating story, but we won't get into it.
*  So let's go back to Watson. So I was invited to give this talk at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.
*  You know, Watson was sort of president or the director for decades.
*  He lives nearby. And yeah, I was there to give a talk on Schrodinger because I had been looking at the archives.
*  So I had been a fellow the previous summer. So because the archives of a number of really famous people there.
*  So Sidney Brenner, Francis Crick, James Watson also.
*  Right. So I had just been digging in the archives to find out actually whether I could whether I could find any obvious traces of evidence that Schrodinger's ideas had percolated into the way they were thinking.
*  About the problems that we're interested in in the 1950s, 1960s. Right.
*  So anyway, I go there, go and give a talk. This was a few months ago.
*  And to my total surprise, James Watson is in the audience.
*  He was like through Zoom. Right. Or was he? No, no, no, no.
*  They wheeled him in like he came in. Right. No one has seen him.
*  And like since before the pandemic. Right.
*  Right. You know, he's had to he's had some trouble because of many of his unsaved reviews.
*  You know, they they renamed the School of Biology. It used to be called the Watson School of Biology.
*  Now, you know, they've been canceled a little bit.
*  I mean, perhaps with some with with some justification, given some of the views that he persistently holds.
*  Right. I mean, people who know him have told me that he's never been a particularly nice guy.
*  I mean, he was like this when he was. But anyway, it's super exciting, of course, to have someone like that in the audience.
*  Right. And almost surreal, because here I am giving a history talk.
*  And it's not like super recent history. We're talking 1940s, 1950s. Right.
*  And and in the audience is one of the main main characters of my story in the first row.
*  Listening to what I have to say, seeing the quotes that I am putting on the on the screen of him.
*  Was that unnerving at all? Super surreal. It was a little bit.
*  And I, you know, I I normally try to do my homework, right.
*  That's it. Well, so I I try to when I'm I'm not afraid of making controversial claims.
*  So, of course, when you do that, you need to make sure that, you know, that you you're only in some sense showing the tip of the iceberg of the work that you've done.
*  Right. So if questions come, you can always justify why they say you're saying what you're saying.
*  Right. If you agree with other people, it's you don't actually have to do as much work.
*  But so, you know, I knew I was I was unnerved a little bit.
*  I was shocked. But at the same time, I knew that I knew that things were going to come.
*  I knew that he was going to say something. Right. And so I was prepared for that.
*  But, I mean, I would have liked to have known in advance because maybe I would have I would have been able to change my talk and maybe maybe even make it even more provocative to get him to respond in the ways that I expected.
*  I didn't expect him to be. So anyway, he was there. I gave my talk.
*  He fell asleep a couple of times. I mean, I'm standing with the guys.
*  Ninety four. He's the last of that generation, by the way, which is quite amazing.
*  And I don't know how long he will be with us. But it's it's it was a unique opportunity.
*  I mean, he won't be around much longer. And I was quoting him saying that in 1946, in 1946, he had read Schrodinger.
*  And that's what led him to give up on mythology and to turn to to to the study of DNA.
*  And, you know, that led essentially to the development of molecular biology.
*  Right. And he was there. Anyway, I at the end of my talk, you know, I had some I'm the lesson that I'm drawing from this is that certain decisions were made by the architects of molecular biology, which have not been good.
*  Right. Which have had some bad consequences. And of course, he picked up on that. And and he said, well, you know, what you're saying, what you're saying about us having neglected physics is crap.
*  He said, crap like that. You know, silence in the audience. All the faces turned to him and then turned to me to see how it respond.
*  So I actually tried to engage with him. I said, you know, I can see how you I can explain what I said.
*  I appreciate that. But I can explain if you want. I can elaborate why why I said that. And so I tried to you didn't just say, no, your ideas were crap.
*  And that's what you didn't know.
*  But, you know, this is like, who am I? I mean, I'm nobody. Right. So I'm I'm trying to just make him understand why it is that I'm saying what I'm saying.
*  And interestingly, he he retracted it. He said, well, we were dealing with exactly remember his words, but it was something like we had to deal with the simplest possible models.
*  So, of course, we were not able to take into account everything else. And I said, OK, well, that's that seems reasonable.
*  But then the next thing he said was completely unreasonable. And we haven't made much more progress ever since. Anyway, we're still with it. And I was like, really?
*  So I was hoping to continue that conversation after the talk, which is where it gets the picture that you saw when it was taken after the after the talk.
*  We briefly had an exchange, but he wasn't interested. He just, you know, and then he left.
*  I didn't even get to talk to him to ask him whether he agreed with the hypothesis, you know, the hypothesis that I had proposed about, you know, how he if he really was influenced by short and in the way that I had suggested.
*  So really odd. I mean, in some sense, a missed opportunity. But on the other hand, it was it was really great to see him rep to see him voice the view that I was criticizing.
*  Because sometimes as a philosopher, you're worried that you are drawing a straw man that your career career, caricaturizing your opponent's view.
*  But to see what's in the flesh, defending the view that I think is empirically wrong and presenting it and defending it and being upset by what I had said and said, showed to me that I'm on the right track and showed to me that at least my target is correct.
*  It may not be a target that reflects many people that are alive today, but it's it's it's it's a view and it's the view that dominated the field for much of the latter half of the 20th century.
*  So in that sense, it was a very gratifying experience to be able to get confirmation from one of the people who was there.
*  One of the actors, one of the instrumental people.
*  Is it worth saying what the view was? And or would that take?
*  Yeah, OK. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So the view is is the view that I'm saying comes from shorting.
*  It's the view that the order of the cell and ultimately of any multicellular organism is a consequence of always basically is the amplification of water that already exists in in the hereditary substance.
*  It's sort of this pre formation is few where, you know, basically what you everything is already in case right in the in the in this molecular substance.
*  And it's more than that.
*  It's also that this substance is extremely rigid and fixed.
*  It has to be super rigid and fixed chemically speaking, because otherwise it would be subject to the you know, the disturbing effects of Brownian motion, right?
*  Of thermal agitation.
*  So showing the reasons right that in order for DNA or for the hereditary substance to be in the form of water, it's not a problem.
*  It's a problem for DNA or for the hereditary substance to be able to to essentially store this information, even though he didn't use the word information to store this information over years, centuries.
*  Right. It had to have this incredibly solid, rigid molecular structure, a periodic crystal and a pretty crystal.
*  Exactly. All right.
*  And so and from there he says, well, that order then has to be passed on to or has to be transmitted to the proteins and potentially the entire cell has to in some sense manifest the order that is already encoded in the DNA.
*  And so the implication is that the proteins themselves also have to be rigid enough to be able to keep that order right and to to execute the functions according to the to the sort of the the program in the in the DNA, which by the way, is another metaphor which we use all the time.
*  You know, program, which one can already also trace to Schrodinger.
*  And so I think that view is actually the view that I that I criticized in earlier work.
*  It's a view that I think is very problematic.
*  We shouldn't think about proteins in this way.
*  I mean, maybe even DNA in that way.
*  Right. Proteins are plastic.
*  They're dynamic.
*  They don't have a rigid structure.
*  Sometimes they don't even have a structure at all.
*  They're completely denatured.
*  And so they just bind to substrates and they then adopt a confirmation.
*  So and that's it's fine that that wasn't known.
*  But what matters is that now that we know that right, we need to rethink how we how order is transmitted.
*  If it's really the case that all orders already in the DNA, we have order from order, which is shorting this term.
*  Well, if you have order from disorder, if orders emerging from chaos, if you have like things happening right that enable order to to emerge right through nonlinear interactions, through self organization, through coupling of the order.
*  So, you know, it was it's a nice it's for me, as I say, this this kind of work gives me an understanding of why it is that those ideas are still around.
*  Right. And also why it is that people today are very resistant to them.
*  Right. It's it's less natural for molecular biologists to think about the cell as a physical system as as it's less natural for molecular bodies to think about to to draw on what physics tells us about the cell, namely that it's a physical cell.
*  That's constantly, you know, importing energy and matter.
*  And it's it's it's it's it's a process.
*  Right. Then it is for them to think about it as a piece of engineering.
*  And that's very interesting, because why should we think that the engineer, the engineering view reflects better this natural entity that is a cell.
*  Right. Why should we think that is normal to expect circuits with wiring directly to the cell?
*  I mean, why should we think that is normal to expect circuits with wiring diagrams to be things that we should find in the cell?
*  It seems to me that that's that doesn't follow at all.
*  And the only reason why we think that way is because we've been thinking that way for a long time.
*  We're used to thinking that way. Right.
*  So the historical work comes in in trying to work out why it is that where these ideas come from.
*  So this is the machine conception of the organism or MCO as you abbreviate it, which you've written a lot about.
*  So is it OK?
*  No, I mean, I can just tell you that I the MCO has lots and lots of different incarnations.
*  Right. Machine metaphors come up in different contexts and evolution development in the context of the cell molecular biology.
*  You still have I mean, I've done I looked at the history.
*  You still have appeals to machine and engineering metaphors earlier in the 20th century and even before that.
*  But the way we think about the cell today, I think the most approximate cause is this is this this argument that Schrodinger puts forward about determinacy.
*  He wants to have this determinant view.
*  And the reason he wants that is because he wants to disagree with his physicists colleagues about the implications of quantum mechanics.
*  There are other interesting reasons about why it is that Schrodinger adopts this deterministic view of biology.
*  But yeah, so of course, if you look at the MCO more generally, the machine conception of the organism and you look at it in the context of physiology, the classic starting point is Descartes in the 17th century.
*  Right. Right. Right. Even that is just the starting point, because you can you can see scholastic authors thinking about this as well.
*  Yeah. So metaphors, they're useful.
*  And I know that you regard the machine metaphor or conception of the organism as a useful metaphor.
*  In neuroscience, the most popular metaphor is the computer metaphor for the brain.
*  Yeah. So I don't know if you have maybe we can come back to that.
*  But you've spent you've spilled a lot of ink, you know, coming up with at least three so far reasons why the machine conception of the organism is maybe not as useful as maybe not universally useful and should be replaced with a processural view that the organism is as a stream.
*  Right. So I would love to just kind of step through the three arguments from teleology, from thermodynamics and from scale.
*  And and then I don't know if you have other arguments that you're working on.
*  I know you have a project, but yeah. So no, I mean, the first of all, I it's useful, but that doesn't mean it's true.
*  I mean, sometimes we we conflate these.
*  Right. So it is almost the burden is on me to explain.
*  I mean, if I'm going around telling people that this is a bad way of thinking about organisms, right, then the first question I'm going to get is why are we still using it if it's so terrible.
*  Right. And so that's where the distinction between truth and usefulness comes in.
*  Something can be false and yet be useful because it provides a reasonable approximation for particular context.
*  Right. If you're doing particular projects, empirical studies, then it may be helpful to think about muscle contraction in terms of mechanical forces.
*  And that's all fine. Right. So what matters is whether we're getting the right view overall of the of the cell or the organism.
*  There, I think is where the machine metaphor breaks down.
*  It's just inadequate. Yeah. So George P. Box is often quoted as saying all models are wrong, but some are useful.
*  And I suppose the same could you just switch out models with metaphors in that statement?
*  Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's inevitable, right.
*  That when you do a metaphorical re description, the target domain, what you're re describing is going to be different from the source domain.
*  Otherwise, you wouldn't be appealing to metaphors in the first place. So the identification is never going to be complete.
*  Right. It's just that when a metaphor or model is very, very successful, we forget.
*  We forget that we that we actually trans, you know, we drew on something to make sense of something else.
*  And just we see that something else to the lens of that first thing.
*  Right. And that's that's where the that's that's where the problems begin.
*  Right. When we forget that. So anyway, you can come up with a number of reasons why this is a way to think about it.
*  There are reasons why this is a problematic way or a wrong way of thinking about about about life.
*  The three arguments that you say that I've put forward, they're not intended to be sort of not exhaustive lists.
*  But the basically arguments that also appeal to different audiences.
*  Right. So if I'm talking to philosophers, it may make more sense for me to talk about teleology, you know,
*  which is a term that is not necessarily very familiar to every scientist.
*  If I'm talking to, you know, to to to scientists, it may make more sense for me to talk about thermodynamics.
*  Right. If I'm talking to physicists or to or talk about scale, you know, I'm talking to molecular biologists.
*  Right. So that's that's where the distinction comes up.
*  It doesn't mean that these arguments are completely mutually exclusive.
*  Right. One can think of the first to actually connect it in some way.
*  So very briefly, just to to to outline them. So the argument from teleology, again, this is I don't claim originality here.
*  This is an argument that has come up in different ways since at least Kant, if not earlier, one could argue even Aristotle.
*  And it keeps coming up. Right. You see it in the work of people like Locke unexpectedly and a number of a number of authors.
*  The idea is that we should think about goal directed processes in two ways.
*  There are two kinds of teleological systems, ones that we can call intrinsically purposeful and others which we can call extrinsically purposeful.
*  All of that distinction amounts to is that entities that are inwardly directed intrinsically purpose.
*  It means that are those that where their behaviors and their operations are directed towards their own maintenance.
*  Right. So everything that when you're thinking about function, for example, in biology, you can think of what each part of the system is doing as a contribution to the maintenance of the system of which it is a part.
*  Right. And that sense, it's it's contributing to its to its to its maintenance.
*  So it's so its own maintenance is its purpose. OK. So organisms are that kind of system, the systems which which you know which which everything that they're doing in some sense, right, can be interpreted as contributions to their own maintenance.
*  Right. Whereas extrinsically purpose of systems and systems whose operation are directed to ends that are outside of themselves.
*  Right. So they are they do. So machines do what they do because that benefits the maker or the user of the machine.
*  Right. Your toaster, you know, cooks heats up your bread in the morning, a slice of bread.
*  And it does that not for itself, but because you are going to consume that bread or your car drives you from point A to point B.
*  That's not in the interest of the car. That's in the interest that you are the one who is benefiting right from that operation.
*  So in some sense, the purpose if we can use that that concept of the operation of a machine is outside of itself.
*  Right. Does that make sense? Yep. This is actually, you know, immediately connected then to the argument from thermodynamics as well.
*  Absolutely. I was I was going to say exactly right. So the reason why organisms are interested in purposes has to do with a peculiar thermodynamic character.
*  The fact that they exist far from equilibrium, that they are dynamically stable. Right.
*  So the second argument has to do with with that, with, you know, attending to what it is that physics tells us about about organisms and machines.
*  And what it tells us is that organisms are inherently unstable. Then they have to keep acting to keep existing.
*  Right. And so that is a very different state of affairs from the situation you find in machines where there are near equilibrium conditions, which means that they can be you can you can you can use them and then you can turn them off.
*  You know, the way I put it is that organisms don't have an off switch. Right. They have to keep keep going.
*  If they stop acting, they stop existing. It's almost connected to how we think about life and death.
*  Also, thermodynamics gives us a way of thinking about what it means to die.
*  It means to lose that sort of irreversible steady state far from equilibrium and return to equilibrium conditions.
*  Whereas in the case of machines, right. Of course, when you're using them, they may be exchange of energy and even of matter.
*  They may be open systems like a car where you put in fuel and then something's come out as well.
*  But the point is that the car doesn't stop existing when you stop using it.
*  When you park your car at night and go home, you're not worried that in the morning when you wake up, the car is no longer going to be there.
*  Whereas if you if you forget your hamster and I think that's the example I have in the paper, you forget your hamster in your loft.
*  You won't have a hamster much longer. Right. Right.
*  So there's something clearly quite fundamentally different here.
*  And so what I do in this in that paper where I where this the chapter in the book where I present this argument is tease out the implications.
*  What does it mean? What are the implications of us accepting that there is this fundamental difference thermodynamically speaking between organisms and machines?
*  And then the final the final argument is one that applies specifically to appeals to machine metaphors and engineering ideas in molecular cell and molecular biology.
*  And the idea is quite simple. Machine the machines that we design took the whole point of appealing to machines when we're trying to explain biological phenomena is that we are supposed to understand machines quite well.
*  We designed them after all. So they're familiar entities. Right.
*  And the idea is that we are going to use those familiar intuitions and project them onto something that we're less familiar that we're trying to understand.
*  Right. That's the whole point of this metaphorical red redescription of that is involved.
*  But the point is that when you're looking at molecular phenomena, molecular entities, that transposition is going to mislead you.
*  Right. Because machine the machines that we create exist in the in our macroscopic world of our everyday experience.
*  And that macroscopic world is governed by a particular set of physical forces, pistons and ball bearings.
*  And yeah, exactly. Everything that we think of when we think of this mechanical world view. Right.
*  It's very much a macroscopic one. And obviously the world of molecules is a fundamentally different one from a physical perspective.
*  You don't need to know any biology to know that. I mean, any physicist knows right that it's difficult to have directed movement from one place to another when you're a molecule because thermal agitation makes that impossible.
*  Unless you are absolute zero temperatures actually measuring that level of stochasticity that exists inherently.
*  Right. This thermal energy. Right. So that means that to think of molecular processes in a mechanical way is going to it's going to mislead us if we're not aware that the scale at which these processes are happening is so different that the physical forces that exert the greatest the greatest influence are different.
*  Right. So gravity is thrown out of the window. Doesn't really matter. Inertia doesn't matter.
*  But but for example, you have to say Brownian motion is super important. Electromagnetic sort of forces begin to matter a great deal.
*  The medium changes. Right. So water behaves differently when you're a protein. Right. You experience water differently.
*  It's like punching you. It's buffeting you. It's not a liquid. It's like, you know, modelers and physicists when they are looking at proteins, they tend to talk about how the movement has to be understood as if you were trying to walk through molasses or through honey.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And these are, again, metaphors to help us understand that the difference in scale matters. And we just can't willy-nilly just transport these engines and so on and so forth. The cogs and wheels that we are familiar with.
*  We can't just assume that those exist at that scale because they just couldn't. And so that's basically that third argument.
*  And you want to replace it with a more processural metaphor. And we'll talk about process philosophy in a moment. But as a stream, I mean, the organism as a stream. First of all, is that right? Is that?
*  Yeah. I mean, it's basically what I want to do is try to listen to attend to what physics tells us. Okay. Instead of engineering and what does physics tells us? Well, it tells us that organisms are flows of energy and matter.
*  So I'm not naive enough to think that we can get away without using any metaphors. Okay. Right. Even though I'm very critical of the machine metaphor, I recognize the metaphors are indispensable. And it's a good thing. It's not I'm not saying I'm not making a normative.
*  I'm not saying it's something we should be ashamed about. Metaphors we have to talk about things. So we have to use words. So yeah, exactly. I'm often you know, words actually come up. New words are developed.
*  So I'm not saying that the coin as a consequence of metaphorical re descriptions. Right. So I'm not. So what I'm saying is, well, okay, fine. We need metaphors. But maybe we need to use a different set of metaphors. Maybe the time is has come when perhaps we should start drawing on metaphors that capture the, you know, the features of living systems that physics tells us. Right.
*  So in that sense, the processual sort of battery of metaphors. And here, you know, you can think of all not just streams, but you know, vortices flames. Right. And why these become more valuable. And in fact, you know, these are usually referred to as dissipative structures by physicists, right. Systems that are far from a clear and organisms also. Right. So when you're describing organisms from a physical perspective, you actually don't necessarily make a distinction between an organism and a flame. You think of when you're modeling and you're modeling a machine, you're actually going to be able to do that. Right.
*  And so, you know, you're theorizing about them. They're all dissipative structures. Right. Now, of course, it's a very sort of first approximation. And I'm the first one to admit that it's not going to capture everything. And of course, even more so that a lot of things that you capture with a machine metaphor, for example, functions, you know, hierarchical organization is not captured with, with a metaphor overflow. Right. You don't have a division of labor of parts. Right. In a, in a, in a stream or in a vortex. But you do capture other things, arguably, other things that are even more valuable. Right.
*  And that are as or even more important, right. They capture the, the, the, the, so that's to say that the, the, the processual ontology that should lie at the heart of how we theorize about life.
*  So I know that you're not a neuros philosophy of neuroscience, philosopher of neuroscience, but so the machine conception of the organism is, you know, directly paralleled in the computer metaphor of the brain or the brain as an information processing system.
*  And there's been, you know, plenty of voices pushing back and, you know, suggesting replacements for the computer metaphor of the rain, but it has been super useful in neuroscience.
*  And I don't, I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on, you know, if you would explore that literature at all and have thoughts on the computer metaphor of the brain as an information processing computer.
*  Well, I mean, the computer metaphor, I mean, I have some familiarity. I'm familiar with it to some extent because the computer metaphor also comes up in molecular biology. Right. So the way we think about what happens to development, we think of it as the execution.
*  I mean, this is the traditional view, right. The execution of a set of algorithmic instructions encoded in the genome.
*  Yeah. And we, there's talk of, you know, software and hardware as you have in computers. And, you know, the software is the genetic material and the hardware is the embryo.
*  And of course that doesn't really work because the idea is that the software is creating the hardware. Obviously no computer works that way. Right. The hardware has to be already assembled for the software to be able to be run on it.
*  But anyway, the point is that that language and that that's already there. Those metaphors and of course the notion of information also. Right. And the computability and all these things. Right.
*  What matters to me when I think about these things is again the history because if you don't know anything about the history, you may say, well, you know, this is a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about the brain or about the cell or whatever.
*  But when you realize that information language was brought in under particular circumstances at a particular time and there was nothing inevitable about it, you realize that you can't just assume, for example, that information is something that's just out there, which is what the cyber neccessities and others try to argue.
*  And many people think that way today. I mean, information is just like matter and energy. It's just there. And I think that again, a historical perspective allows you to reminds you right that information maybe it's a useful, might be a useful metaphor.
*  But there are some dangers in verifying it and assuming that the only way to think about what's happening and what's going on in the brain is in terms of information processing. Right.
*  It also has interesting problematic, potentially problematic consequences. Right. The idea of computability. That's something that's been taken up by embryologists.
*  You know, they say, well, OK, if there's if there's if there's if the DNA is computing the embryo, right, then in principle, we should be able to act like the Laplacian demon and say, well, if I have all the information, if I know what's in the DNA and I know all the initial conditions, I should be able to compute, determine it perfectly deterministically the outcome.
*  And that some serious respected developmental bodies have made that claim. But that's completely flies in the face of everything we know about about the about the pros, the molecular process that are going on in the cell.
*  So I assume maybe you can we can have a conversation. You can tell me I mean, whether that's maybe that's that's a problem as well when you're thinking about what's going on in the brain.
*  Right. We can't we can't assume, first of all, this deterministic outlook, right. Where you have in the way that you have in a when you when you're when you're execute a program in a computer, you can't assume that at the molecular level that translates to something with the same sort of of determinacy.
*  I don't know what you what what you tell me.
*  Well, I mean, it's interesting that you brought up DNA. First of all, Claude Shannon himself warned against the use of his Shannon, what's now known as Shannon information, because everyone was taking it up in biology and other fields.
*  And he has this really nice short paper warning against that. Anyway, you mentioned DNA and it's you know, there's not enough information in DNA to program all of the just the structure of the human brain.
*  I mean, when you get down to like worms, some worms and you know, some smaller organisms, you could actually fit all of that information into the DNA. But but the connections of our brain, you know, rely on development.
*  Right. So there's a set of instructions, but then there's the developmental process, which we've talked about on the podcast before. So so that computability doesn't exist essentially from DNA to the structure of our brains and I suppose bodies.
*  Well, as exactly as exactly the same that the conclusion that people in development to drawing is exactly that that that it may be a useful idealization. But what it misses is the materiality, the substance of life or the brain, you know, it's if you think about it, these sorts of descriptions are very sort of divorced from the materials, right?
*  I guess that's in some sense there. That's where their seduction lies, you know, that you can you can sort of move it from one that the medium doesn't really matter. But of course, it matters a great deal. Right. The the math, the stuff of life, if it's a brain or there's no stuff, I thought it's all processes.
*  All of that matters a great deal. And it's just an exercise in abstraction to and it might be a useful one for some purposes, right? To think of Boolean networks, for example, just think of zeros and ones and gates and logic gates and just saying, well, you know, and some people have adopted that framework.
*  And some people have adopted that framework. And when thinking about, you know, development, and I'm sure that also comes up in the study of the brain. And so, you know, the question then is, well, are you are you suggesting you can ask the person who's defending that view that this is the way that this is a useful way of understanding, you know, is this reflecting what's actually going on, you know, the molecular level?
*  And my my my suspicion is that that's where it's much harder to defend those those metaphors, right? Because they don't take scale seriously, for example, this might be another example, you know, a place where this argument from scale that I mentioned has some bearing on discussions in neuroscience.
*  Let's move into talk a little bit more about process philosophy. So you just use the word abstraction. So I just kind of want to bounce some ideas off of you, I guess, around the notion that processes are more fundamental than things than substances.
*  And again, I'll direct people to your book, Everything Flows, just for lots of different essays regarding different subjects and accounts of different subjects as process philosophies. But you just use the term abstraction. And I was, you know, I've been thinking about processes a lot since I talked to Yogi actually, a handful of episodes, and he refers to your work a lot in his in his own work.
*  One of it's I don't know if it's ironic or paradoxical, but one of the things that is considered to be a fundamental aspect of our intelligence is our ability to abstract. So if the thing to explain from a process philosophy perspective is how things can become static.
*  So it seems like an abstraction, a concept, a thing, which is what makes us intelligent. One of the things that makes us quote unquote, intelligent is to be able to conceive of concepts as things as static kind of entities, that it's interesting that the thing that or one of the things that makes us intelligent is our ability to conceive of things incorrectly.
*  That's a really, really interesting and interesting reflection. I think that's right. It's almost paradoxical, right? But if it's if we do define intelligence that way, we could say that in that, that we demonstrate our intelligence when we transform a world of processes into a world of substances through our concepts.
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure what that means, though. I don't know how to judge it.
*  I mean, I think that again, if we want to understand why it is that process philosophy and process outlook has always been the minority view, we have to reflect on why this that the substance view is so much more familiar to us. And surely that part of the answer or part of the story there is going to have to do with that cognitive process.
*  With how we perceive the world, with how we reason with the language, with how we use language. Right. So it's almost as if the our entire disposition or everything about us is geared towards thinking in terms of substances, because that's easier.
*  And I guess that is why the more one reason why the process view is seems to us counterintuitive, why it seems unfamiliar, even though, and here's the argument, you know, it that is, I think the view that the science is giving us of the world. So the natural science is telling us it's not just biology, biology, physics, chemistry, is telling us that the world is dynamic and processual through and through.
*  All the way down. And yet the way we think the way we use language, the way we use concepts, everything is based on this other metaphysics.
*  We're going against the grain almost in that sense.
*  Yeah, I mean, as all of what you said, maybe the what makes us intelligent is the ability to to to in some sense abstract from the dynamic and and find points of that stay the same of states that enable us to keep track of what's going on.
*  But the result is the result would be creating a false ontology.
*  Yeah.
*  One that we have to resist. Right.
*  One that thankfully science itself can.
*  I mean, look, I would be I would not be defending this view if it was just some sort of exercise in armchair theorize.
*  Right.
*  Okay. The whole reason why I think this is a very compelling view is because it's the view that I think we should we should embrace if we take the findings of natural science seriously.
*  Right. This is a this is a metaphysics. It's true.
*  And this scares lots of people. It's a metaphysics that is grounded in science.
*  It's not it's not armchair metaphysics based on intuitions that you may have when you're meditating by the fire.
*  It's something it's it's basically let's work out what view of the world we should have if we if we take seriously the findings of science and we happen to focus on biology.
*  But as I say, I mean, a hundred years earlier, people like Whitehead came to the same conclusions when looking at physics.
*  So in some sense, the revolution in biology is overdue.
*  Right. And many of these organicists that I mentioned at the beginning of the about discussion were already aware of this in the 1920s.
*  We're already talking about organisms as processes.
*  They realize that this is the way to think about them. Again, that's another reason why the history there is useful.
*  So so, yeah, it may seem like a lot to take in.
*  Right. Sometimes scientists are not are not very happy with this word metaphysics.
*  It seems to not have the right connotations, but you can think of metaphysics also on a continuum with science.
*  You know, metaphysics is not fundamentally different.
*  I mean, you think about science as the enterprise that we engage in when we want to find out what the world is like.
*  That's also what metaphysics is doing is just doing it at a at a high level of abstraction.
*  You know, and so surely that's the case.
*  Then metaphysics has to be grounded or there has to be some dialectical relationship between science and metaphysics.
*  Right. One has to inform the other all the time.
*  And of course, that means that if science changes, you know, we should be prepared to change also our metaphysical conclusions.
*  Right. Which, of course, metaphysicians are not necessarily inclined to do.
*  I mean, when I was presenting this stuff again, the target audience mattered a great deal.
*  So when we presented this kind of work to audiences where there were metaphysicians in the room, they were, you know, they were like, why you care so much about science?
*  You know, why, you know, we use your intuitions, you know, and there's a very different sort of tradition in analytics metaphysics that doesn't necessarily take the findings of sciences as that important because they can change.
*  Right. So, yeah. And then, you know, you talk to scientists and you get the opposite problem.
*  You know, metaphysics, well, why, why are you drawing those sorts of conclusions?
*  Yeah. Yeah. So, so it struck me that there's a current kind of trend in neuroscience and computational neuroscience.
*  That lends itself well to a process perspective, and that is the idea of computation through dynamics.
*  So when you're recording, when you're looking at the activity of a large population of neurons, you can reduce the dimensionality.
*  So if you have a thousand neurons, that's a thousand dimensions, right, of activity.
*  But if you can reduce the dimensionality according to the variance of the population of neurons,
*  and then what you see is this trajectory in this lower dimensional space along often along a manifold, some sort of shape, right, some sort of low dimensional shape.
*  And there's a trend in recently in thinking of cognitive functions as these sort of trajectories along these manifolds, which is a very dynamical and process oriented perspective.
*  So I don't know that neuroscience is writ large is aware that that's a sort of a processural view.
*  That's super interesting. It sounds a bit like dynamical systems theory.
*  It is. It's directly from dynamical systems theory. Yeah.
*  That's using the tools of dynamical systems theory to analyze these high dimensional populations of neurons.
*  So, yeah, I mean, there are similar approaches, not not part of the mainstream, but you can find them historically, you know, proposed and then forgotten.
*  But available to anyone who cares to look or people who try to, for example, think of development in this way, instead of thinking about genes being switched on and switched off static things, thinking about patterns and dynamic flows and the stability.
*  For example, we have this notion homeostasis, right, in physiology.
*  Waddington, one of these developmental biologists, also an organicist, by the way, but someone who actually tried to perhaps the one that's been least forgotten.
*  Most people know who Waddington is. He he came up with this notion of homeoresis, homeoresis as a contrast, sort of as the other side of the coin of homeostasis.
*  Homeoresis is not not not sort of stability around a particular variable, but actually stability across time.
*  Right. That when you look at development in many processes, they are they are stable temporarily, meaning that they are able to compensate against perturbations and keep the same sort of trajectory paths.
*  So it's it's, you know, and what Waddington was very much inspired by Whitehead.
*  And what you see in his in his theorizing is this idea that you were just describing, where you focus more on patterns, right, on things that are dynamic instead of the individual entities, which would be deemed to be less important.
*  But the pattern through time is a process of view of identity, right?
*  Yeah, that's right. So that's how we think about identity. Right. So you want to think about why something stays the same across time.
*  You think about what's how it's being maintained about the you know, you think about it.
*  You think of I mean, it's it's it's inevitable if you if you take the time seriously and you don't.
*  I mean, in some sense, process thinking is a consequence of taking time seriously. Right. Right. We just we're just not very good at taking time seriously.
*  So, you know, at any moment in time, you you are just a time slice of the person that you are. Right.
*  You are extended in time. And so to if you want to understand, say, an organism, you need to look at the entire life cycle of the organism.
*  It reflects through time. It's just that when you're looking at a particular when you're looking at any entity at a particular time, you're just dealing with one instance, right.
*  With a temporal part to use a metaphysicians term. And that's a interesting locution because you can start thinking about parts temporarily in the way that we think about parts spatially.
*  So in the same way that your arm and your head are parts of you, you can think of you, the you of yesterday and the you of today as also parts of you, temporal parts.
*  Interesting. And if you take that seriously, that idea that it means obviously that you need to consider the whole and the whole in this context is not is not you at any moment, but the you across time.
*  So again, you always have lingering at the back of your mind that scientist question of how am I going to translate this into how does this help me write in in my work?
*  Because obviously it's really difficult to study anything across across the entire duration of its existence.
*  Right. Most of the techniques and tools that we use in science slice are meant to.
*  Yeah. If you think about it, that's what we're doing.
*  We're always working with time slices and we are expecting we can abstract the entire process on the basis of these snapshots, not like a movie.
*  This is an aside, but you don't favor looking too much to Alfred North Whitehead, which a lot of people appeal to him as sort of an originator of a process philosophy.
*  But is it because he used a bunch of neologisms made up a bunch of unnecessary words or is his process philosophy the incorrect process?
*  I mean, he he is the person that nowadays for better or worse is people think of when when you say the phrase, you know, process philosophy and there are good reasons for it.
*  Right. He was the person perhaps who most systematically developed a process view.
*  And, you know, the reason why I'm not I'm not a Whiteheadian is because I don't think that he exhausts.
*  I think the process thinking can exist beyond what Whitehead happened to say about processes.
*  Right. He offered one proposal and it's fine.
*  I mean, but when I when I looked at it and when I did this this this post, I was part of this project with John DePray and Exeter on process.
*  We actually tried to read process in reality. We didn't get very far.
*  Why? I mean, is it really the is the effort worth it?
*  When you talk to Whiteheadians, you talk to processual thinkers who are Whiteheadians, they live in Whitehead's framework.
*  You know, they and they disagree exegetically about what Whitehead meant by certain categories and by certain terms.
*  And I'm like, that's not my project. That's fine.
*  If you want to do that, I care about about about science.
*  I care about a view. What view we need of the world that makes sense of the science that I care about.
*  Right. So it's still processual.
*  But, you know, I don't have to avail myself of the of these terms and this way of thinking.
*  And that's that's one reason I can give you many more. I mean, he his view is not really totally actually fully processual.
*  He believes in the sort of actual occasions that the atoms of the of the processes that he suggests.
*  You know, he has also it's a metaphysics that is not particularly naturalistic.
*  Right. It's not conforming with science.
*  There's God, there's a field, there's a process theology.
*  And, you know, you process thinking is already hard enough for scientists to accept.
*  You don't want to make your work even harder by saying no.
*  If you want to accept what I'm saying, not only do you have to accept that the world is dynamic,
*  but you also have to learn and read this opaque prose by this early 20th century author.
*  But that is not to say that the history is not relevant.
*  In fact, you know, if you when you I'm sure you saw that when I after discussing Whitehead,
*  I go on to discuss these these biologists that were inspired by Whitehead.
*  I said, well, actually, those people have all the way they translated that thinking turns out to be much more helpful for me
*  than the thinking of the of the master, as it were.
*  Right. So second order Whitehead.
*  Maybe I don't know. But the point is that, yeah, there's more than one way to be a processual philosopher.
*  That's what I would say. It was interesting.
*  It made me remember when I was in an undergraduate, I was taking some literature course.
*  I think we read Gabriel Garcia Marquez or something.
*  Anyway, the professor was he did his thesis, I suppose, on Jean Paul Sartre's being in nothingness.
*  And I was really into existentialism at the time because I was young, you know, and I tracked him down and I was like,
*  because it's such a thick tome, that book.
*  And I'd read a bunch of other peripherals works by Sartre and other existentialists.
*  And I asked him, should I read being in nothingness?
*  No, clearly not, even though he did his thesis on it.
*  So maybe maybe it's similar to your Whitehead experience.
*  OK, I have two more process questions for you.
*  One, I had this leading moment in the gym a few weeks ago where I was thinking about consciousness and our minds and our subjective experience.
*  And I thought, could it be like acceleration is a process on top of velocity, which is a process.
*  Right. So it's a process of a process.
*  Is there any fruit in thinking of consciousness?
*  And I know this is maybe just silly nonstarter, but of thinking of consciousness as sort of a process of a process, right.
*  Of a subjective experience as a process of our brain processes.
*  So what would be the underlying process in that in that case?
*  The brain activity would be its own process. Right.
*  OK. And consciousness on top of that.
*  On top of that. Is it odd to think of hierarchical structures of processes?
*  No, no, that's how I think we should think about processes.
*  Otherwise, you can't get very far. You think that this is one process, right?
*  You need to make certain distinctions. Right. So the idea. So, OK.
*  OK, well, I don't know how to get I don't know how to move forward from it.
*  So I want you to help.
*  OK, so I mean, let's talk about hierarchies of processes.
*  So you can think of you can think of, say, the biological world as one huge process. Right.
*  But then within it, you can find different processes within that, which you can identify because they have different time scales, which the turnover rates are different.
*  So think of think of think of yourself. Right.
*  So you you are made up of of organs.
*  The organs are made up of tissues. The tissues are made up of cells.
*  The cells are made up of molecules. And at each of those levels, slow, slow, slow, having energy that the turnover is faster as you go down.
*  Yeah. Right. And you can also even have the level of a population.
*  Right. So at the population level, everything looks everything looks the same.
*  But if you look, the individuals come and go right the same way when you look at the individual, you stay the same.
*  But then, you know, your cells are constantly coming and going.
*  And if you again, if you look at one of your cells, the cell stays the same, but the molecules are constantly turning over.
*  Right. So in that sense, it seems perfectly reasonable to be able to objectively.
*  It's not something that the observer imposes on the reality, but you can objectively identify scales or levels of of of processual change.
*  And you don't actually need to assume that the fundamental level, even if there is one, you might not even have to assume there's a fundamental level is substances.
*  You can just say that the process is all the way down. Turtles all the way down. Right. Right.
*  And that every time you identify substances or you see, of course, you rely on substance to some extent, you're saying, well, you know, the substances are instantiations of those processes, or they are maintained actively by means of the processes above and below them.
*  It's a slow reason why cells seem stable is because the hepatocyte is maintained by processes above it when the liver and also by processes below it by the by all the sort of molecular entities that are doing doing things for the cell to maintain itself.
*  So so I think hierarchies are completely reasonable in a process worldview.
*  The worry I have not worried, but the difficulty I have with thinking about conscience that it's not obvious to me what it is.
*  Yeah, I know. That's always the problem.
*  See, you know, I was thinking when we when we had this correspondence by email and you were talking about what we're going to you were saying what we're going to talk about.
*  And I and I was like, OK, why?
*  I was thinking I've been thinking about why it is that I don't have a great deal to say about about, you know, consciousness and the reason the reason I think is it's too hard.
*  It's just too difficult. I mean, really, I mean, I don't I don't understand, Paul, how people like you are able to devote their time to thinking about such hard problems, you know, but I don't.
*  And that's the problem is I would like to, but it's out of my reach, you know, and that I think it's just been out of reach for everyone forever.
*  But so what's the motivation to get up in the morning and work on such a hugely difficult, intractable problem?
*  I mean, I don't I mean, I want you to figure it out. I want you to solve the mind brain problem.
*  But, you know, the reason why, you know, so if I ask myself why it is that I'm more interested in life than I am in mind, right.
*  Reasonable question, which is what I've been asking myself since we've since we've been corresponding.
*  Interesting. The answer has to be that when I set my eyes, you know, on the horizon of trying to work out what life is, I guess that seemed to me, even though it's an extremely difficult problem within, you know, not within my reach, but something that I can I hope make some progress over the course of my life.
*  Right. A problem that we can begin to illuminate over decades and decades of hard work was.
*  And so that is already that helps me motivate me because I feel like, OK, my work is not completely useless because maybe I can help illuminate.
*  But when I think about the mind, which, of course, is the next frontier, right.
*  It's so beyond what I can even hope to that I couldn't possibly motivate myself to work on a topic like this.
*  And I guess that's why I never thought about this before. But this just came up to me when I was, you know, in the last two days.
*  Maybe that's the reason why I inherently have avoided looking at questions about mind and conscience, because as your question illustrates about consciousness, we just know so little.
*  Knowledge is so primitive. I mean, I did take a couple of courses on cellular neurobiology.
*  I looked, you know, and we know so little. I mean, it's so primitive.
*  Our scientific understanding what's going on. It's so primitive that I it's almost hopeless.
*  But of course, if everyone thought the way I did, we would never make any progress.
*  Obviously, some people need to do this. I just don't want to be one of them.
*  Right. Yeah, I think that the motivation is just that it's such a miraculous thing that we have that it feels like anything to be a process, let's say, you know, so that it's just it's a fundamental mystery.
*  So but yeah, you reach and there's nothing to grab. There's really nothing to grab.
*  So, you know, it seems I mean, yeah, it does. There's nothing to grab.
*  Then it's almost as if not anything goes. But there's going to be a great, a great range, I guess, of possible hypothesis, because it's difficult to know which one which one we can reject.
*  Right. So, again, I mean, I applaud and I admire people who are scientists, who are looking at these questions, because I just I don't have the I don't have the nerve.
*  I don't have the the person, the temperament to be able to motivate myself to work on something so difficult as consciousness in mind.
*  I mean, and also, you know, if you ask me a question like that, it just almost seems irresponsible of me to try to answer because it's so difficult.
*  So what you're saying is that you agree that consciousness is a process of a process of a process.
*  I think that's what we see any reason not to pursue that. Yeah. Not to pursue it.
*  All right. But we're not going to solve it today. What about so here's my last process question for you.
*  How do I think about the Big Bang in terms of process? Or is it not, you know, because that's a singularity. Right.
*  And I remember seeing like a picture of the size of the corpuscle that was the Big Bang, you know, relative to an ant.
*  And it's like a little ball, which is a thing. Right. So how do we is it worth even thinking about that?
*  Great question. Great question. I don't know. I mean, well, I guess so.
*  The issue is how do you make sense of of an event that has a beginning from a processual perspective? Is that the idea? Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, one could one could take the easy way out and say, well, the very notion of time did not exist before the beginning.
*  That's what I thought you'd say. It's a bit of a cop out. Right.
*  Because you say, well, you know, that makes no sense. Right. Because time begins when that happens.
*  So there is no such thing as before. But we do think of it as a little ball of all of the mass and energy and whatever else.
*  That's right. Yeah. We can. Yeah. I mean, it's no, no.
*  So I'll tell you something about that. I mean, maybe maybe we can go somewhere with this.
*  Has it I mean, has it occurred to you occurred to you that I mean, it's not inevitable for us to think that the universe has a beginning. Right.
*  But for centuries, many people thought that actually that was a silly thing to think that it made sense to think that there's always been.
*  And we're not talking so close. We're talking people who don't believe in creation.
*  So, you know, of course, because creation, the theological narrative has a beginning.
*  And I guess that's why many, many people who believe in that secretly were satisfied when your scientists, physicists start, you know, proposed the Big Bang theory and start thinking, well, you know, maybe the universe has a beginning, because at least it aligns with this notion of a beginning.
*  But the alternative, which was which was defended by many people in ancient Greece, you know, many authors, atheist thinkers is a very interesting one, right.
*  The way you don't have a beginning. It's one that we nowadays find difficult to even make sense of. It doesn't make sense.
*  But, you know, if you if the universe has already has always existed, I wonder, yeah, I mean, I wonder whether that is some.
*  But how can you have something of nothing? That's the well, the idea would be that there was always been something.
*  So there's always kind of been nothing as well. There's no difference then, I suppose. All right. We're really going to.
*  No, no, it's an interesting question to ask. All right. Anyway, I'd like to ask you about artificial intelligence, of which I know that in our in our little correspondence, you're very resistant because you don't, you know, you're not an AI expert or anything.
*  And then if you have time, I'd like to ask you about your interest in artificial life.
*  So given your, you know, your view of organisms as streams, right, as processes, you know, I guess the question is, what does that say about using a computer or something, you know, to model artificial quote unquote intelligence?
*  Well, I guess what I want to connect is the idea of the organism and life with the idea of intelligence and whether intelligence, which also another fuzzy term, ill defined, whether we should think of intelligence as something that is inherently connected to life or, you know, the idea of artificial intelligence in general is these days modeling, trying to model human intelligence.
*  And our fancy are because we're the most intelligent things in the universe. Right. So, but should we do we need to change our notion of intelligence when we're talking about something that we're programming a computer to do, even if it learns, but a computer has no autonomy, has no self organization, has it's not far from thermal.
*  There's no far from thermal equilibrium issues.
*  I don't know. I just wanted to get your kind of overarching view on on artificial intelligence and how to think of it. Given the machine.
*  The reason why I was. Yeah, I mean, the reason why I was resistant is because I don't know much and I don't want to I don't want to speak about things. Yeah. Yeah. But I'll give you my my two cents. I mean, I think that and I think the
*  Attempts to, for example, think about biological processes, psychological processes in silico are going are making a number of assumptions, which which we have to test. We don't have to accept. Right.
*  That again, this relates to what we talked about before that the process can be abstracted from the material that instantiates it. Right. If one thinks that we can recreate what it means to be intelligent in a machine.
*  What it means for it to have an intelligence that resembles ours, then we are making that sort of assumption. And I think that that's that's problematic.
*  I mean, the if you think of the classic most famous attempts or examples of AI, I mean, I don't know much about this, but I know, for example, of the deep blue, the classic situation, right? When we had this computer that was able for the first time to defeat best chess player at chess.
*  Right. That seems like a great accomplishment of AI. But the question is, you know, what do we draw from that? What conclusions do we draw? Do we draw the conclusion that the that the the computer reasons the way that a human reasons when they play chess and they reason better?
*  Well, clearly, no. Right. Because the computers is is computing is considering all these different chess moves. Right. Millions and millions and millions. And clearly, that's not how the human mind works. Right. The human mind, I guess.
*  I don't know much about chess, but presumably, you know, uses intuition and a number of other factors come in. Right. Heuristics. Well, you know, so that's clearly not a conclusion that you can draw from that event when deep blue defeated Kasparov.
*  So what can you say? Can you say that the computer is smarter than Kasparov because it defeated him at chess? Well, again, there is what do we mean by smart? We talk again about computability.
*  Maybe in that sense, yes. But we, I think, tend to think about intelligence or something more than that. Right. Are there going to be aspects to intelligence, creativity, imagination, ability for abstract thought that are not necessarily captured by the computing power of a machine?
*  Right. So again, my I have nothing against the eye. But surely what what we need to be careful about is what we conclude. What what do we think we license to conclude from those sorts of events? Right. And I don't I don't know the literature well enough to know what it is that people thought we had accomplished by defeating humans by by creating maybe you can tell me what was the conclusion from that sort of. Yeah.
*  Yeah, deep blue would be the wrong example. A more appropriate example for these days is something like AlphaGo or AlphaZero out of deep mind, which of course, it's always in the game's domain beat the world champion go player.
*  But it was trained by essentially playing itself over and over the most recent celebrated version. You know, you you have to train the model, but it trained itself by playing itself and go over and over. I mean, it has a built in architecture.
*  But as it's training, it's changing its weights and stuff like that. And I mean, it's a big, complicated model. But so so that is a scale that is it's a really large scale and was not necessarily modeling the brain or our intelligence. Right. It's it's just given a task and trained to do that task.
*  However, a lot of what we talk about on this podcast is using those kinds of models as models of our brain activity and our cognitive function. And there's been a lot of progress in that. And and from a thinking about it from a process perspective.
*  There's you know, there would be something missing. You're not capturing the actual process process of nature of our intelligence by using a machine that you can walk away from for 100 years. You come back, your hamster is dead, but the machine you can just turn back on.
*  Right. So I'm, you know, I don't have conclusive thoughts about this, which is why I wanted to ask you about it. If if there you agree that there's just you know, what would be missing from using an AI model as a model of our brain and cognitive processing?
*  You know, it depends on on what the what the the reason is for doing it in the first place, what the motivation is. If we want super, if we want machines to conduct extremely difficult tasks that it would take a human ages to calculate, then then there's no reason to there's a good reason to fund this kind of research.
*  The issues only emerge, I think when when the intention is to draw certain scientific conclusions, when it's not just the technological feat that we're after. Right. Right.
*  That's what I'm asking about is the, you know, using artificial intelligence in the pursuit of understanding natural intelligence.
*  I think there is where one has to step in and say, well, yeah, I mean, yeah. And say, well, I mean, are we what to what extent can we say that this that this system is embodying?
*  Well, first of all, it's embodying the same sort of behaviors that we can manifest through our intelligence. But that may be easier than if it's causally right. If the mechanisms of course, the means by which computers do what they do and behave intelligently are going to be fundamentally different from the way that we do it. Right.
*  Because they don't have a brain that the circuits are going to be of a very different nature. So surely that's all that's already that's an easy answer. Right.
*  So we're not going to learn about the intricacies of brain function by looking at by devising these AI systems because they don't work in the same way. Maybe at the functional level, there are some similarities.
*  But if you're interested in the causes or how things happen, surely there is a this analogy there. So that's one one thing that one could say.
*  And it's a very simple reason why. I mean, the matter of life is is organic and it's it's just different. I mean, as you said, physically speaking, it's it's exists in a different sort of situation.
*  Right. Themodynamically speaking, then then then in silico systems, right. Obviously, fundamentally different. And I guess that's also what a chemist would want to say. Right. I mean, chemistry and I think matters to to.
*  That's why I'm also I mean, this also applies to people talking about organization in the abstract. I really like the work of people like I noticed that you mentioned this in your conversation with Yogi, Alvaro Moreno and Matteo Masio.
*  Yeah, friends of mine. I love their work. Great book that day. That's all great stuff. And one of the things that they have tried to do in comparison to the earlier sort of autopolysis tradition of Varela Maturana was to and I and yet I don't think they do it.
*  You know, they don't do it enough is to show that any conversation of organization has to be grounded in in it can't be too abstract. We can't just talk about organization on its own because it's not we're not going to get very far.
*  First of all, the scientists are not going to be that interested because it's too abstract. Secondly, we're still in a situation where we don't know really what we're talking about.
*  And I think those same concerns exist probably much more magnified by many, many times in the discussions of intelligence. Right. We need what is it that our goal is?
*  If our goal is what you said and try to illuminate the psychological processes and our cognitive capacities, then surely there's very little presumably one can one can derive or draw from from these sorts of models, I would say.
*  Interesting.
*  So the most recent celebration in AI are these what are known as foundation models or large language models. Have you heard of these?
*  No.
*  Like GPT-3 and palm and there's these really giant models that you can just give a prompt to some text and they'll generate a story based on like a question that you ask it or or if I gave like your name and the name of your book and asked asked it to write a summary, it would generate some summary of the book probably because it's been trained on Wikipedia and read it and the corpus of the entire Internet.
*  But because of that success, I mean, these are based on words, right, which are tokens that then are vectorized into sub symbolic structures.
*  But, you know, we used to we think that we're special because of our ability to generate language, right, and generate and understand language and words are traditionally thought of as symbols.
*  And then so then I thought how to think about language and perhaps symbols in a processural manner.
*  And I don't know if you have thought about this, but but this, you know, hearkens back to the concept of abstraction that we were talking about before and intelligence and part that's part of our intelligence is to be able to abstract and create a concept or and or a symbol.
*  So I don't know if you just have thoughts about that.
*  I just want to throw that super interesting.
*  I don't have much to say.
*  I mean, what I would say, one thing I can say is that abstraction really matters in process thinking because it's the way for you to make sense of what everyone else thinks is going on.
*  So everyone else thinks the world is substance is made up of things.
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  So abstraction is your tool to, in some sense, save the phenomena, you know, to say, well, you know, what you think is going on is actually a product of what Whitehead called the fallacy of misplaced concreteness.
*  Right. It's this famous phrase.
*  Right. Yeah. So the idea there is that you, yeah, you take something that is actually dynamic, you take it to be concrete, because for heuristic reasons, it's helpful to.
*  But in the case.
*  I forgot that that was the case.
*  Yeah. But in the case of the material world, you can think of a rock just as a super slow process. Right.
*  That's the point is that at the material level, everything is perceptual at the conceptual level.
*  I mean, for certain experimental context, things have to become thing like.
*  And that's the actual of abstraction.
*  But if we didn't do any abstraction, we're just talking about the world.
*  There will be no reason essentially to adopt a substance view.
*  Right. Everything would just look like processes that are stabilized at different time scales and that they they seem to be stable only to an observer looking upon upon that thing at a particular time.
*  So then what's a concept? Good example.
*  Yeah. So then what is a concept or a symbol?
*  Is it a super, super, super, super, super slow process?
*  Or do we need to?
*  Well, I guess I guess concepts can be just because there are abstractions.
*  They don't have to reflect reality.
*  A concept you can just say a concept is whatever I want it to be.
*  And I'm going to take as my concept something that doesn't change.
*  That's how I define it.
*  So it's analytically true that that's what the concept is, because I'm defining it that way.
*  The question is not that the question is whether how well that corresponds to what's going on or how useful it is.
*  And I'm not, you know, and I'm very happy to consider I know it's useful.
*  We're doing it all the time.
*  It's useful to to project onto reality.
*  These idealizations, these things that we know are not right because for certain context is good enough.
*  It's like a discussion of Newtonian mechanics and general relativity.
*  I mean, for all intents and purposes, we can do very well.
*  Engineers designing bridges can just appeal to classical mechanics without having to worry about,
*  without having to worry that that framework isn't strictly speaking right.
*  You know, so we could think about the substance view in that same way.
*  It's an approximation to reality and it's a perfectly serviceable one in certain context.
*  But remember, the meta positions care about the big questions.
*  What is the ultimate, ultimate, ultimate reality?
*  Yeah. When is what's the title of the What is Life book?
*  Is it What is What is Life?
*  That'd be a good title. Or is what what is life?
*  It's just going to be what is like revisited. Oh, revisited.
*  Oh, I like what is what is life.
*  What is what is life?
*  I guess it's a bit of a misnomer because it's I mean, Schrodinger wasn't writing about life.
*  He was, you know, you know what I'm saying?
*  Like the title is a very savvy and easy to remember.
*  But it's not a book about life. It's a book about genes and the cells.
*  So if I title my book What is Life?
*  I'm concerned people are also going to think that I'm addressing the sort of questions we're discussing right now,
*  which are leaving for the future.
*  And then the subtitle could be I met James Watson and told him all his work was crap.
*  He told me he told me I was actually thinking of maybe including that in the footnote.
*  You totally should. You totally should.
*  Because that's a momentous thing. Yeah.
*  It's all you have to say. It's all crap. Also, that's what he said.
*  Dan, this has been a ton of fun for me and I could go on and on.
*  But I've really enjoyed reading your work and I look forward to more of it.
*  So when you do when you're ready to publish that What is Life revisited book,
*  if you want to come and talk about it and and get the word out, you know, and we'll have you back on.
*  Okay, I will. Thank you. That was been so much fun.
*  Thanks so much, Paul, again for inviting me. It's been great.
*  It's wonderful to think about these things and your questions have been really,
*  really well posed and intriguing and making me think about things in different ways.
*  So I really appreciate that. Yeah, I'll be in touch.
*  All right. Sounds good.
