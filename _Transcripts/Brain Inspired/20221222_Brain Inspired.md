# BI 156 Mariam Aly: Memory, Attention, and Perception
**Brain Inspired:** [December 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNq9sYOqfOU)
*  I think the general way we're viewing it is that there's no clear dividing line between
*  attentional systems and memory systems, but they have to be fundamentally interactive
*  and that attention can shape what your memory systems are doing and how they're doing that.
*  And these memory systems can also then affect what you're paying attention to and affect
*  different attentional systems.
*  So I think the cognitive labels of memory and attention are very useful because they
*  are convenient shorthands that we all intuitively understand and communicate and also allow
*  us to communicate our science to the public.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hey everyone, I am Paul.
*  My guest today, Mariam Ali, runs the Ali Lab at Columbia University.
*  So in the last few episodes of Brain Inspired, we've focused a lot on the interactive nature
*  of our brains and our cognition.
*  So for example, recently on Collins, talked about how working memory interacts with our
*  reinforcement learning systems during learning.
*  And with Michael Anderson and Luis Pessoa, we've discussed how the traditional way of
*  studying brains in terms of individual areas and studying cognitive functions as if they
*  were individual modules functioning independently.
*  That's likely not the best way to study brains and minds.
*  And instead, we should honor the complexity and interactions and integrations of brain
*  areas and cognitive functions.
*  Today's episode continues in that vein.
*  Mariam and her lab focus on the interactions between memory, attention, and perception.
*  And although much of her work and much of our discussion today focuses on one brain
*  area, the hippocampus, she shares the view that it's wrong to think of a single brain
*  area as carrying out a single cognitive function, which we also discuss.
*  The short story is that memory affects our perceptions, attention affects our memories,
*  and memories affect our attention.
*  These effects have signatures in neural activity measurements in places like the hippocampus
*  and other areas.
*  And Mariam details these stories more during the episode.
*  And toward the end of the episode, we go pretty deep into Mariam's personal story and career
*  trajectory.
*  She had a pretty challenging stretch in graduate school regarding anxiety and overworking that
*  I think many of you may be able to relate to.
*  She was very open about her experiences and hopefully her story will help any of you who
*  might be struggling with similar challenges.
*  So I appreciate Mariam being so open with that.
*  Show notes are at braininspired.co.

*  And I would love to have you join our brain inspired community.
*  All right, here's Mariam.
*  Mariam, I read on your sort of backstory that you linked to from your website that there
*  was a time where you didn't know what psychology was.
*  And this rang true to me because there was a time I didn't know what neuroscience was.
*  And it's hard to remember that time period.
*  Do you know what psychology is now?
*  I think I do.
*  I'm pretty sure.
*  Although obviously there's a lot of blurry lines between other fields like neuroscience
*  and cognitive science, but I'm pretty confident that now that I teach psychology, I know a
*  little bit more about what it is.
*  Good.
*  Good.
*  Well, reading your work, one of the reasons why I was interested in having you on is because
*  recently I've had multiple people on talking about the interaction of cognitive functions
*  and how they affect each other and how the brain is a highly integrative complex system
*  and how that kind of changes the views of how we think about cognition and brain function
*  and psychological constructs and stuff.
*  And I'm just curious because we're going to get into talking about many of the much of
*  the work that you have done.
*  But do you feel like you are closer to knowing what you sort of originally wanted to know
*  about how the mind works and how brains work?
*  Because in my career, I felt the more I knew, and this is a common feeling, the more I knew,
*  the more I realized how much I don't know.
*  But do you feel like you've taken steps closer to knowing what you want to know?
*  I think like you, the more I know, the more I realize I don't know and may never know.
*  But I've become comfortable with the amount that we have yet to figure out and that we
*  may not figure out at least in my lifetime.
*  So at least at the level of going from neurons to awareness or subjective reliving of our memories,
*  I don't know if we'll get there in my lifetime.
*  But we do have a better appreciation or I've come to appreciate that we have a better understanding
*  of links between neural networks and components of the mind and the blurriness between different
*  modules of the brain that used to be considered perception or memory.
*  For example, a lot of my work touches on how a given brain region might support multiple
*  aspects of cognition.
*  So in that sense, I think at a high level, I've come to understand a lot more what brain
*  regions and brain networks might be doing.
*  But in terms of the specific question of how do neurons and glia and cells give rise to
*  the mind, I don't know if we'll get there in my lifetime at least.
*  Wow, you threw glia out there.
*  Glia are becoming more and more important.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I'm not in that particular area of work, but I am very curious about it.
*  So I've seen and keep an eye out on studies showing that glia might be a lot more important
*  than traditional neuroscience textbooks would have you believe.
*  Has the target of your interest changed over time as well?
*  Like with, you know, as you do experiments and learn more about what you know and what
*  you don't know.
*  Have your questions that interest you have, how have they changed over time?
*  It's interesting because when I first thought I became aware of psychology without knowing
*  the word for it, I was a child and I was looking at these eyewitness science books that had
*  visual illusions of them.
*  And I was absolutely captivated by the Ames room, which I can describe to you if you're
*  interested.
*  I was just amazed that not only was there this very powerful illusion, but that even
*  if I knew how it worked, I couldn't convince myself to see it any other way.
*  So in that sense, some of my interest started with perception.
*  And then when I went to college, I started to become more and more interested in memory.
*  And so I went into my PhD convinced that I would study memory only to find myself going
*  back to perception, and then finally kind of merging my memory and perception interests.
*  So in that sense, my interests have both changed and remain the same.
*  I don't always do what I intend to do in a particular part of my career, but I find
*  that my interests have become fairly broad, but yet somewhat consistent in terms of the
*  way that the different parts of cognition are tied together.
*  Well, when did attention come into the fore?
*  Yeah, so that's a great question.
*  I had went to my PhD to try to study memory, accidentally found myself in perception, and
*  I could tell you a little bit about how that happened.
*  And my PhD research ended up focusing on how the brain's so-called memory systems can play
*  a critical role in our perceptual experience.
*  And so after finishing that work, a natural next step for me was to understand the links
*  between the brain's memory systems and attention, both because attention affects what we perceive
*  and attention affects what we remember.
*  And it was a relatively under explored part of the field at that time.
*  And so I went to my postdoc to try to find how attention can shape the brain's memory
*  networks and how that can affect what we encode.
*  That's a lot of what we're going to talk about, but can I back up and ask you what
*  is the Aims Room and why is that interesting?
*  I don't think I've heard of the Aims Room.
*  So the Aims Room is this illusion where you as a perceiver are looking at what seems to
*  be a regular shaped rectangular room, except at one end there is a person who appears to
*  be giant and at the other end is a person who appears to be miniature.
*  And so naturally your brain wonders how can one person be five, six times the size of
*  another.
*  And it's because the room is actually not rectangular, it's set up to be a trapezoid
*  so that one person is physically a lot closer to you than the other person and the person
*  who's closer to you appears to be larger.
*  But because of the way you're seeing the room, your brain is convinced that it's rectangular
*  and not a trapezoid and it's extremely difficult for you to overcome the illusion even if you
*  know that it's a trapezoid.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So I have seen that, but I didn't know it was called the Aims Room.
*  So thanks for educating me.
*  Sure.
*  Okay.
*  So you mentioned that you got interested in memory and a lot of what you study is how
*  specifically hippocampal, what you call hippocampal memory is affected by attention and affects
*  attention and perception.
*  And maybe we could just start off by talking about the hippocampus because you already
*  mentioned earlier that you have come to appreciate more how different brain areas can be involved
*  in multiple cognitive functions.
*  And of course, I don't know about you and I don't know how it is these days, but when
*  the word hippocampus comes up in textbooks or it used to, you learn about HM and hippocampus
*  is all about memory.
*  It was that way for a long time.
*  And more recently, of course, with the discovery of place cells and all the navigational type
*  signals that are found in hippocampus, now it's all cognitive maps.
*  Now the hippocampus is all cognitive maps.
*  And or with the Jennifer Aniston cells, it's all abstract conceptual features in the hippocampus.
*  So, how have your own views on the hippocampus changed over time with your own research,
*  but also just the way that research has historically progressed and people have made different
*  claims about the role of the hippocampus?
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  So traditionally, like you said, the hippocampus is a memory system.
*  And for good reason, when patients have damage to the hippocampus, one of the most notable
*  symptoms and one of the most notable complaints by them is the fact that they now have problems
*  with their memory, so both encoding and retrieving memories.
*  So I don't want to minimize that the hippocampus does play a really crucial role in memory,
*  particularly because memory loss is the most salient feature of hippocampal damage.
*  And that's why HM was so notable, is you just have this complete lack of an ability to encode
*  new memories after the hippocampus is gone.
*  And so rightfully, people spend many decades in the field to try to understand how it encodes
*  and retrieves memories.
*  But I think that's the standard textbook view.
*  It's still in the textbooks today.
*  You open a textbook published in 2022 or 2023, and that's the story that you'll find.
*  But I think in the last 20 years or so, there's been increasing appreciation of their role
*  of the hippocampus in non-memory domains.
*  Some of those are because memory is useful in many settings.
*  So of course, many of us will study memory because we think it's an inherently very interesting
*  and a part of who we are.
*  But memory is also used in lots of settings in which you might not think you're using
*  memory.
*  So you use memory when you're making decisions or trying to anticipate what someone might
*  say next or when you're trying to solve a problem or when you're trying to anticipate
*  where you should direct your attention when you're driving.
*  So because memory is so ubiquitous in how it contributes to our behavior, then the hippocampus
*  will play a role in lots of those settings as well.
*  But I think what's more interesting to me is situations in which memory is not needed
*  and not obviously used, but the hippocampus still seems to play a role.
*  One of those that really got my attention and my PhD was perception.
*  So there was a number of studies done in the late 90s and early 2000s in both non-human
*  primates and in humans showing that hippocampal damage can impair perception of scenes when
*  they're all on the screen in front of you.
*  So there's no demand to encode anything into long-term memory.
*  There's no demand to retrieve.
*  Everything is there in front of you.
*  And yet hippocampal lesion patients seem to have great difficulties in perceiving spatial
*  relations.
*  And so one of my main interests now is to try to understand what are the core features
*  of the hippocampus that allow it to contribute critically to memory, but also to make important
*  contributions to these other domains.
*  Since you said spatial relations, one of the things you often write about is the relational
*  aspects of, let's say, information processing in the hippocampus.
*  What does that mean?
*  And why do you think that that's one of the core functions, let's say, of the hippocampus
*  is relational processing?
*  Yeah, I've come to think that one of the very important aspects of the hippocampus is its
*  ability to represent and integrate relationships between different features in the environment.
*  So to give an example, within the spatial realm, you might have a room, like your living
*  room, and your living room contains multiple pieces of furniture.
*  You have a couch, you have tables, you have a television.
*  And we know that different parts of the visual stream might be specialized for processing
*  some of those components.
*  So there might be some parts of the visual system that are specialized for processing
*  objects, for example.
*  Based on work from memory and perception, we think the hippocampus is particularly critical
*  for processing the relationships between those features.
*  So not just knowing that there's a couch and a table, but knowing that the table is to
*  the left of the couch and that if those relations were swapped, then the room has become different
*  in some important way.
*  Or that your living room and my living room could have the same exact components, but
*  if they're arranged differently, that means they are signaling a different room or a different
*  environment.
*  So I can relate that very easily to navigation, right?
*  Because navigation is all about knowing where something is in relation to where another
*  thing is.
*  How do I relate that to episodic memory?
*  Or is it necessarily relational episodic memory that the hippocampus is dealing with?
*  And concepts, right?
*  Abstractions.
*  There must be an easy step from relations to abstractions, since relations necessarily
*  deal with conjunctive features of things.
*  Yeah, I think remembering relations is necessarily a critical part of episodic memory, because
*  it's not enough to remember that you had a particular conversation.
*  You have to remember who you had the conversation with.
*  Or was it you that said this particular sentence or your friend that the conversation happened
*  yesterday or last month?
*  Was it in your office or in their office?
*  So you're remembering not just details, but also the relationship between those details.
*  And if those details were arranged in a different way, then it's a different memory.
*  So I might have a conversation with a graduate student in my lab Tuesday morning, and I have
*  to separate that from a similar conversation I have with them Friday afternoon.
*  So I have to remember those relations for it to be an episodic memory.
*  And it's not that the hippocampus is the only region that stores relations.
*  So like you said, relations are a key aspect of knowing what concepts are or having a schema
*  for typical structures that exist regularly in the world.
*  So knowing what typically happens when you go to a restaurant is a relational structure
*  or a schema.
*  And there are other parts of the brain that can store that type of relational information.
*  But when I think of like a concept or an abstraction, I think of somehow losing the relation and
*  have the abstraction is a higher order concept, right of something that was built out of relations.
*  So how do I marry those two ideas?
*  Sure. Yeah. So you can think of concepts being acquired when you have multiple experiences
*  with a particular entity.
*  And over time, you can abstract the core features of that thing and lose the incidental features
*  that are not important for defining what that concept is.
*  It doesn't mean that you can't still have some of those details somewhere.
*  So in the case, for example, the Jennifer Aniston cell, it could be that the hippocampus
*  is representing the unique concept of Jennifer Aniston.
*  But of course, every time you see Jennifer Aniston, you might be bringing to mind memories
*  of movies that you've seen her in or TV shows that you've seen her in.
*  So I thought you're going to give me a specific Jennifer Aniston memory there.
*  Oh, I don't have many specific Jennifer Aniston memories, actually.
*  I don't either, but I'm sure some cell in my hippocampus fires when I see her on screen
*  or something.
*  Probably.
*  So earlier you said, you know, in your work on the effect of memory and perception and their
*  interactions that even when memory is not demanded, right, damage to the hippocampus
*  affects how we perceive the world.
*  When you're doing something that doesn't require memory, maybe the hippocampus just shuts off,
*  right?
*  No, that never happens, right?
*  Your brain's constantly active, sometimes more, sometimes less, and sometimes in different
*  patterns, as we'll discuss.
*  But, you know, how much of, you know, when you think of memory, you always, well, you
*  often think, except for implicit memory, you think of explicit memory, conscious memory,
*  right?
*  And how much, you know, my memory of cats is affecting something that I'm doing with
*  cats or something like that.
*  But everything's always going on under the hood as well.
*  And do you have a sense of how much that sort of sub subjective memory activity might be
*  interacting with ongoing task related activity that we're trying to bring into that we're
*  focusing on that we're subjectively aware of?
*  Like how much of that is going on under the hood at all times?
*  Sure.
*  It's a great question.
*  Also one that I struggle to know how to precisely answer, because by its nature, we're not aware
*  of it.
*  So it's very hard for us to estimate how much is happening.
*  But of course, in laboratory settings, you can try to see cases where people have implicit
*  memories that affect their behavior, even without their awareness.
*  And my guess is it's probably a great deal.
*  Like you said, although we're very aware of our explicit memories and memories we know
*  we have and can talk about, there's a lot of ways that our behavior is guided by habits and
*  learned statistical associations and repetitions that we have from doing the same thing over and
*  over in the case of many of our routines where we take the same route to work.
*  We walk the same way to our office every day.
*  So some of that is non-hypicample implicit memories that might be mediated by other brain systems.
*  But I think there's also a lot of work in the last couple of decades showing that some of
*  those implicit memories might also be hypocample.
*  So for example, our eyes are drawn to regions of space that might have changed, even if we
*  don't have explicit memory for them.
*  So if you think about walking into your office, something is slightly different.
*  You don't know what it is.
*  Your eyes might go to that location, even if you don't explicitly notice that maybe a
*  facilities person has come in and cleaned the office and moved some of your things around,
*  for example.
*  So I think a lot of our day-to-day experiences might involve some measures of implicit memory,
*  the way that our eyes move, the fact that we're faster at responding to things that we have many
*  associations or many experiences with.
*  They're not sailing it to us, but if you think about it, how fluidly you navigate around your
*  house, for example.
*  You're not thinking about it, but you clearly know where to go, the places to avoid so that
*  you don't run into furniture and so on.
*  This is a total aside, but you conjure thoughts of my wife who doesn't notice large changes in
*  the environment, doesn't seem to notice.
*  And there's a story from one of her old roommates and friends where she would even test my wife
*  by putting this big trash bag, a full-filled trash bag that needs to go out in the walkway.
*  And my wife would just step over it and go on about her days, seemingly not noticing that.
*  What does that mean?
*  Are you sure she's not pranking you in some way?
*  She could be.
*  She could be, or she could have severe hippocampal damage.
*  I'm not sure.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  With such large salient objects, I think the literature would suggest that even with
*  hippocampal damage, you should be able to notice those.
*  I think this is a motivational issue with taking out the trash, perhaps.
*  I haven't tested that one.
*  It could be.
*  It could be.
*  All right.
*  Let's talk about some of the findings that you are continuing to generate from your lab.
*  I'm particularly interested on the interaction between attention and memory.
*  And then there are some other things that I want to ask you about as well.
*  But so traditionally, as you write in your papers, attention,
*  attentional effects have not been found in the hippocampus, or there has been scant evidence
*  for them and for attentional effects in the hippocampus.
*  Why is that?
*  Sure.
*  So we started looking at this question maybe around 2013 or so.
*  That's when I started my postdoc, and I was really interested in how
*  the way that we pay attention influences what our memory systems are representing and what we encode.
*  And of course, there's extensive appreciation of the fact that attention influences memory.
*  And there's also lots of findings showing that attention modulates hippocampal signals of memory
*  encoding and retrieval.
*  What hadn't been found at that point is how attention affects hippocampal representations
*  when there isn't really a demand to be encoding or retrieving from memory.
*  As you are going around in the world, you pay attention to some things and not others.
*  And we're interested in even when you're not trying to encode or retrieve any memory,
*  how does your attentional state affect hippocampal representations?
*  And when I started this line of work, it seemed like
*  paying attention to the left or right side of the screen or paying attention to
*  faces versus houses didn't really seem to affect hippocampal activity at all.
*  And that's in stark contrast to how attention affects visual systems,
*  where if you're paying attention to a face versus a house,
*  there is extremely robust modulation of signals in visual areas.
*  And we figured that some of those null effects in the hippocampus might be because the hippocampus
*  doesn't really care about individual objects as much as it cares about relationships between objects.
*  So that was one reason.
*  The other reason we thought that there might have been null effects in those studies is because the
*  way that attention affects visual systems might be different from the way that it affects the hippocampus
*  in terms of the actual signature you're looking for.
*  So the most robust way to look for attention effects in the brain is to look at,
*  are areas more active when you're paying attention to the features they prefer
*  compared to when you're not paying attention to those features?
*  That's because attention is traditionally, well, one way to think of attention is sort of gain
*  modulation of salient things, right? Increase the activity of your brain to salient features
*  and decrease them to non-salient features, for example.
*  Exactly. So this gain modulation is one of the signatures of attention that has received a lot
*  of investigation and is a really robust signature to find in the brain. So of course, it's reasonable
*  then to look for the same gain modulation in the hippocampus. But we'd also noticed that there was
*  some exciting work from Ronin models that was coming out around that time showing that attention
*  affects not how active different cells are in the hippocampus, but how stable they are in their
*  firing. So place cells, which fire when an animal is in a particular location in the environment,
*  tend to be more stable in their firing, more precise in where they fire when the animal's
*  paying attention to the spatial environment versus other aspects of the environment.
*  So we thought that maybe prior studies had missed signatures of attention in the hippocampus
*  because one, the studies they were using were maybe not optimally designed to tax hippocampal
*  relational processing. And second, you might have to look not just at how active the hippocampus is
*  but also how stable its representations are. So, okay, make the connection for me between stability
*  and okay, so let me back up the old way of doing fMRI, which is currently still in use, is to look
*  at some area and say, is that area, does it have signatures of higher oxygenation levels there,
*  higher bold signal? And that must mean it's more active and you're using that area more.
*  And that's still traditionally, like you said, when you look in visual cortex, for instance,
*  when you're performing something and you're paying attention to the left side of the screen,
*  your right visual cortex will have a higher bold signal, right? And then the inference there is
*  that your right visual cortex is more active, is working harder. I'll back off on working harder
*  because that's something I want to ask you about. But then, multi-voxel pattern analysis came along
*  and started looking at different patterns of activity among all of the voxels. And then you
*  can compare the patterns of this wide array of voxels of areas in the brain and then differentiate
*  cognitive functions based on those patterns. But how does stability relate to those two aspects?
*  Sure, yeah. So stability is related to the second aspect that you talked about of looking at
*  multi-voxel patterns. And so the idea behind stability is just how similar are those patterns
*  across different instances. So imagine you're doing a task where you're viewing pictures of rooms,
*  and half of the time I tell you to pay attention to one feature. So I tell you to pay attention to
*  the relative positions of the couch and the table. And the other half of the time I tell you,
*  you know, pay attention to the windows. The idea with stability is that when your attentional state
*  is the same, the activity patterns in the brain or in the hippocampus might be more similar.
*  So we call them stable because the idea there is that every time you're in a particular state,
*  the brain being states a particular activity pattern that is similar or stable across those
*  different instances. Well, I thought you were going to describe the art gallery task that you
*  employ. Yeah, I was subtly hinting. You should. Let's explicitly describe it,
*  I suppose, because it's not a far cry from what you just described.
*  Sure. Yeah. So one way that we've been looking at attention effects in the hippocampus is by
*  having people do a task that we've been calling the art gallery task. And the idea there is that
*  you can present people with a relatively naturalistic stimulus. So in our case, it's
*  images of 3D rendered rooms, and we get them to pay attention to different features.
*  So half the time we tell them to pay attention to the spatial configuration of furniture. So
*  we create these rooms that have really unique layouts, unique angles in the walls, unique
*  spacing and sizing of the furniture. And half the time we tell people pay attention to the
*  spatial configuration of the room. So where are the walls? What are the angles? How is the furniture
*  arranged? This is the relational part. Exactly. And particularly spatial relationships.
*  Then the other aspect of the task is that we hang the painting in each room. So we place it on one
*  of the walls. And the idea there is that maybe you're walking through an art gallery, and you
*  sometimes are paying attention to the paintings, and sometimes you're paying attention to other
*  features. So half the time you're paying attention to the spatial configuration, and half the time
*  you're paying attention to the art. And people have to do different tasks. So in the room task,
*  they're looking for rooms that have the same spatial configuration, even if your perspective
*  is shifted. So if you are looking at a room, you have to be able to recognize that this is the same
*  room, same furniture, same arrangements, but your perspective has shifted by 30 degrees or so.
*  In the other half of the trials, we call those art trials, we tell people look at the paintings,
*  and try to identify paintings that were painted by the same artist. So you're trying to identify
*  paintings that are similar in terms of the choice of color, the content, the brush strokes, and so on.
*  So that was a way that we could try to manipulate different types of relational tension and see the
*  effects on the campus. And those effects were not, the signature of those effects were not
*  born out in the overall bold activity, right? But the, but the, what you were just referring to is
*  the stability of the patterns. Could you just describe that a little bit more?
*  Sure. So interestingly, we actually saw opposite effects on the bold activity and the stability
*  measures. So in the hippocampus, we surprisingly observed robust deactivation
*  when people paid attention to the room versus the art. So this was unexpected for two reasons. One
*  is that prior studies didn't show any modulation of overall bold signals. So we were surprised to
*  see an effect there. But the second reason it was surprising is the robust deactivation for the room
*  versus the art task, because there's so much literature suggesting the hippocampus should
*  care more about spatial features. But surprisingly, we saw the flip of that in the stability measure,
*  where hippocampal activity patterns were much more stable across different room
*  attention trials than different art attention trials. And this stability measure also predicted
*  how well people did on the task. So this suggested two things to us. So first, the signatures of
*  attention in the hippocampus might be different from those in neocortical areas. And second,
*  that deactivation doesn't necessarily mean disengagement. So you could have deactivation
*  in the hippocampus for spatial attention, but more robust and more stable patterns that predict
*  people's behavior. I just want to add, okay, so this is another aside, but fMRI has always
*  given me pause. Because so I grew up in science recording single cell activity in non-human
*  primates, right? So action potentials. So of course, I'm biased to action potential signals,
*  right? But I understand the value of fMRI. But the interpretation has always been somewhat up in the
*  air. I mean, there have been plenty of studies looking at how bold signal relates to local field
*  potentials and spiking activity. But so okay, one thing is, you mentioned that maybe attention is
*  modulating the hippocampus differently than it does more sensory related neocortical areas.
*  So one question would be, why would that be? And sort of another question would be like,
*  are we just missing stability information because we're not measuring it in early visual cortex,
*  for example? Maybe before I ask. Go ahead. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So I will say we did also observe stability in visual areas. So they also showed
*  modulation of how stable their activity patterns were across the two tasks. Some showed more
*  stability for the room versus art. Some showed the other way around. However, in cortical areas,
*  those stability measures were highly related to the fact that those areas showed more bold activity
*  for one task than the other. Everything went up and therefore you could say it's more stable.
*  Is that the? Exactly. Yeah. So parahippocampal cortex loves scenes. It's more active for room
*  attention than art attention. Its patterns are more stable for room than art attention.
*  But that stability was because voxels that are more active were more stable across different
*  room trials. So that suggested to us that maybe the neocortical signal is a little bit different
*  than the hippocampal signal where activity and stability were dissociated and unrelated
*  at the voxel level. But I do want to acknowledge that the bold signal looks different in hippocampus
*  and in neocortical areas. And the coupling between aspects of the bold signals and
*  local field potentials is also different across the hippocampus and neocortex.
*  Oh, I didn't know that. What is that relation? So some studies have found that there seems to be
*  sometimes a lack of relationship between bold signal and hippocampus and different
*  aspects of the local field potential. Whereas in neocortical areas is usually a relationship,
*  a positive relationship. So for example, gamma could be related to higher bold signal.
*  That's not to say that the bold signal is not meaningful in hippocampus, just that it might not
*  be as closely tied to some aspects of neural firing. So if I was going to amend what I said
*  earlier, it's not necessarily that attention acts differently on hippocampus than neocortical areas,
*  but the way that we're measuring it with fMRI looks different in the hippocampus versus
*  neocortical areas. So I've always had this naive thought that, so years ago, there was a correlation
*  made between the LFP signal and bold signal and oxygen levels. And the interpretation of that is
*  that bold is more of a measure of incoming signals, right? The signals coming into the dendrites and
*  less a measure of outgoing signals. It's less correlated with spiking activity. And one
*  interpretation of that is that a brain area is working harder when there's higher bold, right?
*  And I'm sorry if I don't know this from the literature, but another interpretation of that
*  is that it's less efficient. It's working less efficiently because it's having to...
*  It's working less efficiently because it's having to... You can imagine a circuit, right,
*  in some very automated behavior that just fires really quickly and gives rise to very little bold.
*  And maybe that's related to the lower activation and the stability patterns that you saw.
*  So one interpretation of bold anywhere in the brain is that a higher bold means less efficient
*  processing, which is kind of the opposite of a higher bold signal means that area is
*  involved in the task more than some other area, right?
*  Yeah, I agree with that completely. And I think based on my work, I'm very hesitant to conclude
*  that lower versus higher relative bold signal necessarily means anything in particular.
*  The fact that there's differentiation in the bold signal across tasks means that there is a
*  signal related to the task. But in terms of whether more is better or less is better,
*  I am not going to reach conclusions at least based on the work that I've done and I've seen.
*  So we interpreted the hippocampal effect exactly the way that you mentioned. So
*  lower activity, more stability might mean more efficient processing or kind of
*  silencing of irrelevant information. So you have low activity, maybe only the neurons that are,
*  of course, I'm jumping to neurons, which is based on fMRI, but could mean that only the neurons that
*  are the most relevant are firing and there is suppression of the ones that are irrelevant or
*  not needed, which could lead to lower activity, but more stability. Here is where I think it's
*  really important that we not just focus on fMRI, but the conversions of results from fMRI and other
*  methods. So for example, if fMRI told you that the hippocampus seemed to be disengaged by a
*  particular task, but then hippocampal lesion patients cannot perform well on that task,
*  then we should amend our interpretation of fMRI. Does it mean that less activity is disengagement?
*  It means that there might be more efficient processing or something else that's going on.
*  Hmm. Maybe we should talk about how you've studied, first of all, well, first of all,
*  you've caused me to start smoking again with some of your research.
*  Oh no.
*  No, I'm just kidding. I just inject nicotine or acetylcholine.
*  Yeah, it's funny.
*  Yeah. But your results could potentially cause someone to rethink whether they should quit smoking
*  because you've looked at effects both for damaged hippocampal
*  in patients with lesions to the hippocampus and how tension affects memory in that way.
*  And you did a smokers study. So what have you found with smokers and with damaged hippocampi?
*  Sure. I'll start with the hippocampal lesion patients, but without first
*  just mentioning a caveat that every time I talk about this work, I try to encourage people to not
*  smoke because of the results of the study that the effects that we see on behavior while positive
*  are not going to outweigh the devastating effects on one's health.
*  Unless all you care about is having a better attentional effect.
*  Indeed. That's true. And of course, I'm appreciative that we have been able to use
*  samples of cigarette smokers to get some of the insights I'll share with you. But
*  of course, it would be better if people didn't smoke in general,
*  despite the benefits it gives to me personally for my research.
*  Have you had media outlets that reach out to you because this is
*  something that would make for a good headline, right? Smoking?
*  That's yeah. I'm trying to wonder. I'm just trying to remember if they have. I don't think
*  anybody has reached out about that particular study. We'll see what happens after this podcast.
*  Oh, sure. Yeah. Okay.
*  But yeah, so to backtrack a little bit. So we had designed this art gallery task that we
*  initially had used in fMRI. And the story there is the hippocampus was modulated by the task and
*  seemed to be particularly important when people were paying attention to spatial relationships.
*  So the next two questions we wanted to ask is, is this hippocampal modulation actually critical?
*  So is it doing something necessary for the performance of that task? And if so,
*  how is that happening? Or why is it happening? So we found we recruited a sample of patients with
*  medial temporal lobe damage. So of course, the first caveat here is their damage was not
*  restricted to the hippocampus. Some of them had more extensive lesions. And even for the patient
*  whose damage seemed to be restricted to the hippocampus, of course, there's going to be
*  broader network abnormalities. But the main lesions in these patients were in the hippocampus and
*  surrounding cortex. And we had them do a version of the art gallery task where they're trying to
*  find rooms with the same spatial layout, or trying to find paintings by the same artist.
*  And we find that these patients are totally fine when they're trying to find paintings by the same
*  artist. And they are very impaired when they're trying to find rooms with the same spatial layout.
*  So statistically, the patient group was not different from chance levels. And I'll say here
*  that, you know, we showed them two images on each trial, the images were on for a couple of seconds
*  with, you know, a couple hundred milliseconds between them. So everything was should be within
*  the realm of, you know, online perception, potentially working memory, there weren't any
*  demands to encode anything into long term memory. So from that study, it seemed that the medial
*  temporal lobe generally is probably doing something critical for the performance of the task because
*  these patients could do other attention tasks, but were at chance at finding rooms with the same
*  spatial configuration. So that's why I kind of linked earlier to converging results between
*  African-American and patient studies. So hippocampus showed the activation for the room task,
*  but it seems to be playing a really critical role in performance of that task.
*  Can I just ask, interject, because we were talking about, you know, the classic roles of hippocampus
*  and abstraction being one of them, we talked about how abstraction and concepts are related to
*  relational processing. And it seems like judging whether the same painting was hung on the wall
*  in different presentations of the stimulus is somewhat related to abstraction and concept
*  formation. And maybe not, maybe it's just related to statistical features of the art or something
*  like that. But in that sense, your results, do they argue against a role of, for the,
*  for abstraction in the hippocampus? Does that make sense?
*  Yeah, that's, yeah, it does make sense. I guess that that hasn't been the way that I've been
*  framing the past, but I think it is an appropriate way to think about it. So when you're trying to
*  find rooms with the same spatial configuration, you might consider that as a demand to abstract
*  away from the specific features you're looking at with any given snapshot of the room, and to find
*  the same high level relationship in another view of the room. So something I didn't mention earlier,
*  actually, is that the rooms with the same spatial layout were different in other ways. So we changed
*  the wall colors, we swapped chairs with different chairs. So you couldn't do the task just by looking
*  for identical features that repeated, you had to form a higher level abstracted representation of
*  the spatial layout that wasn't so dependent on the specific visual features you saw. And same for
*  the art. The paintings were not identical, but had abstract similarities. Right. But the effect that
*  you found was specifically for the spatial layouts, right? So it does seem to be much more spatially,
*  I guess, spatial memory abstraction. I guess you can, there's room for all three of those interpretations.
*  Sure. Yeah, I guess what I would, what I wish, in hindsight, I would have done differently,
*  is how to task that was as relational as the room task, but in a non spatial domain.
*  So when we got the results we got, which we were actually a little surprised, because we thought
*  the art task would be quite relational as well. We realized that there are probably ways to do the art
*  task based on paying attention to individual features or summaries of features like color.
*  And although that wouldn't be a perfect strategy, it might get you decently, decently good performance.
*  So one interpretation of our results is the hippocampus really cares about space. The other
*  interpretation is maybe the spatial task was more relational, and the art task was less relational.
*  And if we'd had a better task that had as much spatial, sorry, as much relational demands as the
*  room task, but not spatial, the hippocampus might have been just as involved. The challenge there is to
*  quantify. Right. That's what I was going to ask you. Have you had thoughts on how to do that?
*  I, so I don't know the best way of doing that. Space is a really convenient way of studying
*  relationships because you know what the relationships are, and you can manipulate them very precisely,
*  you know, chair to the left or right of table. Time is another feature where you could manipulate
*  relationships. So relative temporal onsets, for example, with art, maybe we, you know, went a
*  little too high level. And it was a little difficult to define what the relations were
*  in the first place. And how many of them there were, obviously. Do you know the study of the
*  relational birds that are have been used like, yeah, by Tim Barons. I'm wondering if you could
*  just use those, those stimuli and somehow I'm not sure if he quantified the, I guess you can
*  quantify how much the legs are stretched and the necks and stuff like that. So that might be
*  something, but then that's also kind of spatial. Yeah, that's an interesting idea. I guess it's
*  also kind of an object in so far that's a self-contained, you know, a duck is more object
*  like than it is a scene, which could be okay. But there is work suggesting that the hippocampus
*  might care less about relationships within objects than relationships across scenes. But it would be
*  a good control task where you could at least manipulate different relations in a different
*  type of stimulus. Anyway, I'll get my people on it and we'll figure this out. How to. Perfect.
*  Let me know when you do. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So but I interrupted you and I don't remember where we
*  were if. Oh, yes. The cigarette smoking. Oh, sure. So based on our fMRI and patient data,
*  we thought that we had some evidence that the hippocampus is important in attending to spatial
*  relationships during these rapid online attention tasks. And we wanted to understand that the
*  mechanisms by which that happened. So what are the neuromodulatory systems that might allow the
*  hippocampus to contribute to performance in perception tasks? And we were very motivated by
*  computational modeling studies and work with road models, showing that the hippocampus might
*  switch between states that are optimized for attending to the external world and states that
*  are optimized for retrieving memories. So these kind of switches between internal and external
*  modes. And that work suggested that the acetylcholine neurotransmitter system might be important
*  for biasing the hippocampus toward this outward state where it's paying attention to the outside
*  world rather than to internal memories. So we thought, you know, if that's true, then if you
*  manipulate the cholinergic system, you might be able to get people to perform better on
*  attention and perception tasks that are recruiting the hippocampus. So what I really wanted to do is,
*  you know, a double blind pharmacological manipulation with a cholinergic agonist versus
*  a placebo and see whether we could get better performance on hippocampal tasks with
*  cholinergic agonists. But you couldn't? The problem was, you know, well, so I was in my,
*  you know, first or second year and as an assistant professor, so I just started my lab.
*  And the advice I got was, you know, maybe don't do this before tenure, you know, it could take
*  five years. It was very logistically challenging to do that. Yeah, and yeah, a long time. Yeah.
*  But okay, but then the other route is just to recruit smokers, I suppose. Yeah, exactly. So
*  my first thought was, okay, maybe I'll put this project on hold and revisit it after tenure when
*  I can, you know, have the flexibility and the time to do a study that could take many years and be
*  logistically very challenging. But then I was, you know, talking to other people in the department
*  and one student said, why don't you just test cigarette smokers? And I thought, you know,
*  if it's between not doing this project, or maybe waiting five to eight years and doing it versus
*  just, you know, having a fun study on the side, why not just do it and see what happens? How
*  messed up, though, is our current system, right? Our current system that that really affects your
*  research thinking about your career and what is good for your career versus what is best for science.
*  And we don't need to perseverate on this issue. But it's just a shame.
*  I think it is. And you know, some people will say, you know, I'm just going to do the research I
*  want to do, regardless of whether it's ideal for me right now. I was a little too too scared to do
*  that. Right. And I figured, yeah, and I think it would be better to prioritize slow, careful science,
*  you know, rather than counting publications or looking at where those papers are published. I
*  think there should be a lot of credit given to people who do studies carefully and slowly and
*  well powered and reach conclusions that are robust and replicable.
*  But for now, I don't think we're there. Yeah, well, at least in the United States,
*  right? I think that there are systems in Europe where you're automatically, you know, you sign up
*  in your tenure, tenure track, unless you screw it up or something like that, right? This is a political
*  conversation now. But at this point, maybe people should go to Europe if they want to do slow,
*  careful science. Yeah, I do hope there could be a cultural shift towards slow and team science too,
*  that there's no need for, you know, individual labs to kind of try to do everything alone
*  and potentially reproduce the same scientific question and same experiments across labs,
*  rather than collaborating, it might be a better use of money as well. So I do hope that maybe
*  we'll move towards that in the future. You know what, one good use of money is not is
*  purchasing cigarettes because they're very expensive. Yes, indeed. Yeah, so that'll take
*  me back to the study where we, you know, decided just initially it was like a fun side project,
*  you know, why not just try it, see what happens. And it's successful that could open the door to
*  a lot more people being able to do pharmacological manipulations, people who don't have access
*  to the resources of the medical schools that are needed to do other types of drug studies.
*  So we recruited people who smoke cigarettes. And we asked them to participate in two sessions. One
*  was one in which they they woke up, they smoked the usual amount they smoke. And then they
*  These were light, these are light smokers. I'm sorry to interrupt. They were very light smokers,
*  right? Yeah. Yes. And that's a critical point to make. So thank you for bringing that up.
*  We selected people who are relatively light cigarette smokers who did not count as dependent
*  based on a questionnaire that we gave them. And the reason for that was to avoid the withdrawal
*  effects that you would get with people who are heavier cigarette smokers. So these are people
*  who smoke maybe a few cigarettes a week. So they would come in, they smoked, you know, one or so
*  cigarette, they came into our lab, they did the same study that we use with a hippocampal lesion
*  patients. And we compared that to a session in which we told them to not smoke for 12 hours,
*  before coming into the lab. Both sessions were first thing in the morning. So it's not that we
*  were asking them to, you know, go entire day without smoking, they went to sleep, they woke up,
*  maybe had a few hours and then came to the lab. So then we had an on nicotine session and an off
*  nicotine session. We we were not very confident that people would follow our instructions. So
*  um, we purchased a carbon monoxide monitor for people to breathe into. So carbon monoxide turns
*  out to be a very effective way of measuring how recently someone has smoked a tobacco cigarette.
*  So if you smoke, carbon monoxide levels go up and they decline slowly over over hours. And
*  um, this measure is also very highly correlated with nicotine levels in the person's blood.
*  So we could use this carbon monoxide measure to make sure that people, you know, followed our
*  instructions. And second, to have a measure of nicotine. Because what you're saying is all
*  smokers are liars. I get the I see the causal connection here. I generally have very low faith
*  in people following instructions across the board, you know, and that that includes everybody. But
*  yeah, so we had this carbon monoxide level for each individual. And we had their performance
*  when they were on nicotine, and their performance when they were off nicotine. And what we found
*  was that individual differences in these carbon monoxide levels, so essentially a measure of how
*  much more someone smoked on versus off nicotine predicted the performance enhancement on the
*  hippocampally mediated room task. So the people that showed, you know, more smoking in the on versus
*  off session tended to show the greatest boost to their performance when they were on nicotine,
*  specifically in the hippocampally mediated task and not some other control tasks that we had.
*  So that was consistent with the idea that higher coal energy signaling might bias the hippocampus
*  toward this external attention mode that could improve your performance on external attention
*  tasks that talks hippocampal processing. How important are these attentional effects? Like,
*  how big are they? Right? For instance, and I'm jumping ahead here, but one of the things that
*  you've studied is how attention on states when people are at high, highly attentive states versus
*  when they're not paying attention to something how that affects memory, and you found effects
*  there. But then compared to what's called the temporal context, organizational structure of
*  memory, essentially where when you think back in time, you don't remember things out of order,
*  you remember things in the order in which they happened at the time. And that effect was just
*  dominant, right? And so I'm not sure this is a fair question to say, you know, I'm not asking
*  you like how much power your results yielded, right? Statistically, but just your overall
*  picture of how much attention is affecting our memory. Sure. Yeah, I think attention can have
*  stronger effects on some types of memories than others. And different levels of attention also
*  matter a great deal. So if you take an extreme example, if you are paying attention to a movie
*  versus completely zoned out looking at your phone, taking a nap, you're not going to remember the
*  movie in that latter case. So whether you're paying attention to something or not, whether
*  your attention is full or divided, those will have robust effects on your memory. Other types of
*  attention might matter a little bit less. So say that you are, you know, generally on task and
*  paying attention, but every once in a while, you know, you're paying a little bit more attention
*  than others. In that case, your memory might still be decent in those periods where you're,
*  you're, you know, out of the zone, not paying attention as much because you're still generally
*  on task. So I think, yeah, some types of attention matter more than others for memory. And if you're
*  generally attentive, more might get in than you would expect. I was trying to, in preparation for
*  this conversation, there's a phenomenon that I've experienced personally, and I assume other people
*  experience it also. So I'll ask you about it. I have found that, so obviously, when you, you know,
*  are paying attention to what you're doing, you're more likely to remember it better. But then there
*  are certain things in my personal experiences, and I cannot conjure one right now, where I just
*  can't seem to remember something, you know, like, and there are experiences where I think to myself,
*  ah, pay attention now, right, like studying for a test or something. This is what I need to remember,
*  focus, pay attention, you know, so sort of a self-talk and a desire to pay attention. And there
*  are certain types of memory, I suppose, for which that does not work for me, for which I fail over
*  and over. Even though I am trying my hardest to pay attention, I am kind of confident that I won't
*  remember it later, and then I don't. So what's wrong with me? Oh, I don't think there's anything
*  wrong with you in particular. That's the good news. So I think all of us probably have that experience.
*  I think part of it is because attention matters, but it also matters how you engage with the
*  material. So for example, I'll give an example for when I was in college and trying to study
*  for exams, you know, and I'd read the textbook and I'd tell myself, you know, you got to remember
*  these details, and I would try to like highlight the ones that I thought were more relevant.
*  But it felt like in the act of highlighting and trying that I was like doing the work,
*  but I wasn't, you know, it's like offloading. It was like highlighting is not the same as committing
*  to memory. And I wouldn't remember anything I read. So I think it wasn't the intention that was
*  enough. It's how I engage with the material. And I felt like trying to form rich connections or
*  associations and testing myself was a lot more effective. So not just like this detail is
*  important, try to remember it. But how can I remember this? How can I link this to other things
*  that I know? What are the features of it that I think will help me access it later? And then try
*  to test myself on it, you know, five, 10, 15 minutes later, a day later, to make sure that I retained it.
*  So you fixed yourself and I'm just a poor learner, I suppose.
*  No, I still have that experience, particularly for real life events or
*  where you're not consciously thinking I need to engage in it in a certain way and do some
*  interval training and do some, yeah. Yeah, then I have a terrible memory for a lot of things,
*  including movies and books. Even if I'm engaging with them, and I would like to remember them,
*  you know, they're there in my mind for a while and they're gone later. And I think part of it is
*  because I'm at least a lot more destructible than I think I am. So I've caught myself a lot
*  mind wandering when I'm reading or watching television or whatever. And I think it's not that
*  I'm trying to remember at some places, but I'm often switching to my internal mode and
*  thinking about things that I need to get done and that's just destructible.
*  You need to start that smoking, right? Smoke when you read.
*  That's right. Maybe.
*  All right. Well, so we've talked a lot about how attention affects memory, but you also go the other
*  way and you study how memory can affect our attention. And in this particular case that I'm
*  thinking of, you're looking at hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Maybe you can just say
*  a word about what you found about how memory itself in turn affects attention as well.
*  Sure. Yeah. So a lot of the ways people study attention and a lot of ways I've studied
*  attention in the past is telling people what to pay attention to. And of course, that's common in
*  many aspects of life. You're teaching and you're telling people, hey, pay attention to this lecture
*  I'm giving. Attention is also sometimes captured automatically. If you hear a loud noise or
*  something jumps in front of you, your attention is going to be captured by that.
*  But there's also been a lot of interest in how memories, so our memories of past experiences,
*  guide what we pay attention to in a particular setting. And we've been really interested in how
*  our long-term memories can affect what we pay attention to or serve as guides for our attention.
*  So we were interested in seeing hippocampal contributions to memory-guided attention
*  with the idea that if your memory tells you what to pay attention to, you can prepare better. So
*  if you know that you're going to walk into a room and the projector is in a particular setup,
*  and you know where the lecture is going to be, you can have anticipatory attention to the correct
*  place in the room. And we were inspired by a lot of the work in memory research showing hippocampus
*  anticipation signals. And we were interested in whether the hippocampus can anticipate what
*  you're about to pay attention to. And so we had people do tasks where they could, based on memory,
*  know what they're supposed to pay attention to in an upcoming trial. This was, again, the art
*  gallery task. So you could know in the next few seconds I have to pay attention to spatial
*  configuration or to artistic style. And the general finding was a hippocampus showed a preparation
*  signal. So its activity patterns when you're about to do a room task are the same as the activity
*  patterns when you're going to do the room task. So it's as if it has this preparatory configuration.
*  So that you can do the task with a head start when you start the trial.
*  How does it get that preparatory configuration? Because one way to think about that as well,
*  you have to then attend to the appropriate memory, right? So then it's like attention
*  grabbing the right memory and then the memory is going to affect the attention?
*  Sure, yeah. There was a couple of different ways that you could think about the preparation signal.
*  So one is maybe the hippocampus is retrieving similar memories. So it's retrieving memories
*  of other times you've done that task. And the preparation signal is just you thinking of those
*  memories. Another way to think about it is that you know generally what it's like when you have
*  to process spatial information. So maybe your attentional state has to be wider or broader.
*  And so it's a relatively abstract attentional set geared towards specific types of information.
*  So it's like it gears up and by gearing up it puts it into that,
*  maybe we can say low-bold or more stable set state to prepare because it needs to be online
*  for the task at hand. Yeah, that's the general idea. At least that's how we interpret the data.
*  Yeah, but you saw these same kinds of signals in medial prefrontal cortex, right?
*  That's right. The difference between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal signal,
*  if I'm remembering correctly, is that the hippocampus showed more preparation when your
*  attention was guided by memory rather than just us telling you that you have to pay attention.
*  And wasn't it more, there was a bigger effect for the spatial aspect as well and medial prefrontal
*  cortex didn't care as much about that relational spatial aspect or maybe I'm not remembering.
*  Yeah, I don't remember if we found that particular result. I think there we just focused on
*  preparing for either room or art but didn't separately look at preparation for spatial
*  versus non-spatial. So then zooming way out, which is unfair to do, to ask you to make a grand
*  sweeping conclusion about attention and memory and the relation between them, what kind of big
*  picture do you have in mind for how attention and memory are related and interact and then of course
*  how that happens in brains? That's a very big question.
*  So I think you have 12 seconds to answer. No, just kidding. Oh, no.
*  I think the general way we're viewing it is that there's no clear dividing line between
*  attentional systems and memory systems but they have to be fundamentally interactive
*  and that attention can shape what your memory systems are doing and how they're doing that
*  and these memory systems can also then affect what you're paying attention to and affect
*  different attentional systems.
*  Attention is notoriously slippery just conceptually and in terms of mechanisms etc. But memory also
*  is still historically debatable how many different forms we have. There's the encoding,
*  the storage aspect, the retrieval. I mean there's all these different facets of memory.
*  Where are we in terms of understanding what memory is and how it works and what attention is and how
*  it works? How do you view that in the large scheme of things?
*  Yeah, I think the challenge is that there's many types of memory and there's many types of attention
*  and they can look very different. So it's not always clear that they're really the same
*  cognitive process that we're studying depending on the specific instantiation of memory or
*  attention that you're looking at. So attention that's automatically captured by sudden movement
*  might look very different in the brain than attention that's guided by your memory. You can
*  prepare to direct your attention to a specific visual feature, a specific location in space,
*  a specific type of task and those are all going to look very different. Specific memory.
*  Or a specific memory. And likewise you might be interested in memory for an episode. So our
*  conversation today you might be interested in your memory for how to tie your shoes or how to ride a
*  bike and all of those are going to look very different. So I think the cognitive labels of
*  memory and attention are very useful because they are convenient shorthands that we all
*  intuitively understand and can communicate and also allow us to communicate our science to the
*  public. But it might not be that your brain respects those particular divisions. There might be
*  so much variation within memory or attention that one word to describe them doesn't adequately
*  capture the way that your brain represents the different features. But they're convenient
*  shorthands for talking about our science. Well I mean I mentioned that the smoking study
*  would make for good fodder for a headline and then I thought well what would that headline be?
*  It's something like smoking improves attention. And maybe I'm doing a disservice by even saying
*  that out loud. But then that masks so many subtleties and details of what attention is.
*  Is it carbon monoxide or is it the subtleties of the study? I don't know. Maybe that's just
*  commentary. But I just continue to grapple with these psychological notions that we
*  are continually refining. So yeah. So I was just kind of curious in your own head how comfortable
*  you are with these sort of shorthand notions. But I guess for someone an expert like you,
*  that shorthand notion opens up this wide net of detail that then you can explore that more
*  detailed conceptual space as well. Exactly. Yeah. I like to differentiate between concepts that I
*  think are useful for communication and ones that I think are useful for shaping our research. So I
*  think the difference between perception and memory is important for talking about what we're
*  studying and talking to the public and loved ones about aspects of our experience. People
*  intuitively understand that when you talk about memory you're talking about your representation
*  of something that might have happened a while ago that is no longer here. And when you're talking
*  about perception you're talking about something that's in front of you. And I think that's useful.
*  It's a good shorthand for introducing our tasks to each other for example. But it's not so useful
*  for thinking about how the brain and cognition are carved because it's very difficult to separate
*  perception and memory in behavior. You can't have memory for something you never perceived.
*  But in the brain probably in my opinion is not divided along the lines of perception and memory.
*  There's no module in the brain where perception ends and memory suddenly begins. So I think
*  these concepts are not going to define the way that I ask particular research questions,
*  but they're still useful for talking about and communicating the research.
*  You know you said modular and I've recently had Luis Pessoa on and Michael Anderson and
*  we've talked about the breakdown of that traditional modular view of the brain,
*  that everything is in these well-defined modules. And I know that you're interested,
*  I mean I know that you basically agree with that essentially, right? Because you've written about
*  it multiple times and thinking of the hippocampus as a module and the memory module. And yet you
*  know when you look at networks and functional connectivity and look at resting state networks,
*  there are different quote unquote modules of the brain in terms of these larger dynamic networks.
*  How modular is the brain?
*  Yeah that's it's it's modular and it's not. So it's modular, you can have modularity in terms of
*  particular areas that are more likely to form networks with each other than others or different
*  brain states that you might switch between. But I don't think those modules map on to discrete
*  cognitive processes. That you don't have one network that only does memory and nothing else
*  or a network that only does perception and nothing else. And those networks communicate.
*  So even if there are some systems that are more connected or more coupled than others,
*  it doesn't mean that they're not also sharing information or receiving information from the
*  other networks. So in that sense there is some modularity, there are some systems in the brain
*  that maybe show a bias to communicate with each other or might be preferentially associated with
*  some types of information processing. But I don't think that information processing then has a one
*  to one mapping with a type of cognition. So for example I think relational representations
*  are a very important aspect of hippocampal function. But these relational representations
*  can be used for perception and memory and problem solving and language and attention and creativity
*  and lots of other domains. I was going to ask what what would we do different studying HM these days
*  under that perspective? Yeah it's a great question. It's a challenge because when you're
*  first discovering a particular phenomenon it's very reasonable to try to understand what is this
*  brain area doing and what is it not doing and to study that using the particular tasks that are
*  available to you at that time. And over time you could try to find the blurriness between
*  the different boxes or the different tasks that you've used or maybe find how the tasks are
*  different not only because of memory versus attention but also in the representations or
*  the complexity of the stimuli. But I think the way that HM was studied was a very reasonable way
*  to start. And then the further the research goes the more you're able to find the blurriness
*  between the different tasks and concepts. Yeah I mean there's a lot of reinterpretation of what
*  the results mean these days right with HM which is at this point all we can do. I guess we need
*  another HM but let's not hope for that. How modular is the mind right? So you've talked about there
*  not being a one-to-one mapping between the brain area and a cognitive function but how
*  are cognitive functions given your research studying the interactions between what we use
*  shorthand words for memory, attention, but there's just this massive interaction there seems to be
*  this massive interaction between these cognitive functions so how modular is cognition?
*  It can't be very modular I think so I always talk about the relationship between memory and
*  perception when I teach because you know vision is something that seems to be very sensory. You
*  open your eyes and you see things but memory and learning play a huge role in perception and so
*  I sometimes tell my students about these studies of people who have been blind since childhood
*  or birth and regain sight in adulthood and if vision was just you know your eyes getting light
*  and you're seeing then you would expect that an adult who regains sight would open their eyes and
*  they'd see just the same way that you and I do but that's that's not what happens so these people
*  who regain sight in adulthood actually have a lot of trouble making sense of what they see and that
*  means that seeing requires experience and learning and that means it requires memory.
*  There's also you know when you see an object you're of course you know using the pattern of light
*  that hits your eyes to interpret what that object is but you're also using your memories and other
*  information so if the object is partly occluded you're able to use your memories and experiences
*  to figure out what the full object looks like so perception requires memory. There can't be
*  memory without perception because what would you learn and remember unless it was something that
*  you had a sensory experience with so I think it's very easy to find ways that the mind can't be
*  modular but has to be interactive. Given all your research, here's where the fun part is.
*  Do you have practical advice for people who are trying to improve their attention, improve their
*  memory, how to go you know have you altered anything about your daily going about life etc?
*  Sure, I'll do attention first and then I'll do memory. So the attention part is like I mentioned
*  earlier I've noticed how distractible I am and particularly how often when I should be paying
*  attention to stuff around me I'm instead mind wandering or planning or thinking about something
*  that happened earlier in the day and if you start to pay attention to how often that happens for me
*  at least it happens all the time so I'm trying to be better at you know trying to live in the
*  moment and appreciate what's there and by constantly reminding myself to try to focus on
*  you know things that I'm looking at or things that I'm hearing and when I touch myself doing
*  that mind wandering to try to put myself back into this externally oriented mode. But you have to
*  remember to do that. I have to remember to do that. Some people might be better at being
*  at it than I am. People who engage in meditation practices might be able to better kind of keep
*  themselves attuned to the here and now and the sensory signals around them. I just I'm constantly
*  living in my head so I have to remind myself to you know switch and pay attention to you know what
*  I'm doing now and appreciate the sights and sounds around me. For memory I think
*  intentionally engaging with material in a deep way so trying to find associations between what
*  you're trying to remember and other things that you know. Making mnemonic aids for yourself
*  and testing yourself are really key so trying to generate the information rather than just
*  read it and assume that you remember it. One way to do that is you know telling people the things
*  you learned that day so you know if you saw a cool talk you can try to tell somebody try to tell your
*  wife about the cool talk and that might help you remember a little bit better. Yeah. Have you ever
*  ever so this mind like I'm always in my head as well so what you're saying is really resonating
*  with me and I immediately feel sorry for you because I feel sorry for myself or and or and
*  embarrassed that it's much better these days but I remember in high school and especially in college
*  I would read an entire chapter and then realize I was mind wandering the entire time and I my eyes
*  had scanned all the words. I perceptually took it all in and had it was just gone
*  and I always thought that that was just me you know that I'm particularly poor at focusing or
*  something but maybe it's a little more widespread than I'm appreciating.
*  It happens to me all the time and I think it also coincides with how you know how stressful the
*  other things in my life are and how boring what I'm reading is so you know it's a particularly
*  boring thing and I'm very stressed there's no way I'm going to remember anything that I'm reading.
*  Yeah. You said stress and another thing that you write about or have written about is your kind of
*  trajectory in science and throughout your career and some of your own personal struggles so if you
*  don't mind I would love to just kind of talk about that and where you are these days and you
*  know how you think about that. So I was surprised when you mentioned that you like me are constantly
*  just in your head and mind wandering and maybe struggle with focus and depending on stress
*  levels and stuff because I was you know having read a little bit about your own personal journey
*  I just assume that you are a super focused overachiever but you can correct me.
*  Sure yeah that's that's a fair assumption I think probably many people would assume that
*  and certainly in school that's how I appeared to be you know I was a very focused student.
*  I probably took school a little too seriously I could have maybe relaxed a little bit more but
*  I was very focused on trying to do well. I remember going into college and being told
*  you know you should expect your grades to drop by 15 percentage points.
*  You're like screw that.
*  And I found that terrifying you know and my first chemistry exam the class average was something
*  like 56 percent and I was terrified you know I just was set on trying to do well in school
*  for my future career and you know that led to a lot of anxiety it led to a lot of mental health
*  problems that took various forms and it was something that I struggled with throughout
*  undergrad and that got particularly worse in graduate school. So I did struggle quite a bit
*  with my mental health during those times. Tried to maybe focus a little bit too much on school
*  which was meant to kind of reduce my anxiety about doing poorly but I just meant to actually
*  it ended up increasing anxiety and stress because I didn't have other parts of my life
*  to enjoy you know you didn't have I didn't have that social support group for example because I
*  had focused so narrowly on work that I had excluded friends and family and were just
*  kind of spiraling into a bad mental space.
*  Is that an intrinsic property of your personality or was there you know where you do you have like
*  external influences that like pressure and I'm not pointing I don't mean to like point fingers
*  blame you know to your parents but I know a lot of people are you know heavily
*  guided and motivated by their parents expectations and society's expectations.
*  Sure I certainly had pressures coming from various sources but when I started getting
*  really mentally sick I had a lot of support from my family who was extremely alarmed
*  to see that trajectory I was going down on. I had a lot of support from my undergraduate
*  advisors and people who saw me and cared about me but I think I was too far gone to
*  it's like thanks you know I'm fine was my was my reaction.
*  What and just you know cut me off if something gets too personal but what like how did
*  presumably you were making good grades because you're putting all this pressure on yourself and
*  sort of laser focused in that regard so was it your was your health just deteriorating or
*  you know was it like an ex some sort of external manifestation that that people could even notice
*  or is it did you just seem too focused or how did people even notice.
*  My physical health was extremely poor I I'd lost a lot of weight I developed some
*  uh disordered eating I was extremely unhealthy looking as very physically weak by the time it
*  got really bad so that led eventually to me being hospitalized in graduate school because I was
*  extremely close to death so physically you know my I'm sorry did you resist that being hospitalized
*  like how difficult was that and I'm sorry I interrupted I just off the top of my head.
*  No no worries um I kind of did and I didn't so by the time that uh the university reached out to
*  me and told me that I needed to seek care or be kicked out of the program um by that time it's
*  been it was so many years of living that way um I was I was extremely weak I was you know at the
*  point where I could have trouble physically walking um my my heart was damaged um I I looked
*  like I was you know about to die um and I had a lot of trouble just doing day-to-day activities
*  so because of that um I kind of knew I needed help that if I didn't get it I would probably die um so
*  part of it was me like resistant in the sense that I just wanted to continue my life the way
*  it was but part of me realized that my life would not continue um so when I got the message from
*  the university that you know concerned people had told them that I should seek medical care
*  and if I did not I would be kicked out um my first reaction was fear and um just like how can I get
*  out of this you know how can I continue the way that I am totally that would be me and then when
*  I yeah it's just this bizarre thought process that doesn't make sense to anybody except yourself
*  when you're when you're in it um and then part of me was relieved that maybe this would be over um
*  I just knew that I couldn't continue the way that I was because of my I just I couldn't like walk
*  you know it's like um you know I'd had a fall and I wasn't able to get up so wow from dizziness or
*  lack of strength or all of the above or lack of strength I was walking home I didn't have any
*  strength I fell in a field um I yelled for help and a lot of people walked by and one person
*  stopped and carried me home so that was a low point um
*  and uh I knew something had to had to change so I was relieved um maybe as much as I was
*  you know sad and scared um so I ended up going to the hospital where I was hospitalized for
*  um six weeks part of that on a uh cardiac ward because my heart um wasn't so when you're when
*  you're starving your your body tries to use whatever energy source it needs um and that
*  means harder work on the heart because it's uh you're you're it's pumping blood asking for more
*  nutrients or something I don't sorry I'm ignorant I think your body tries to digest whatever I see
*  sources of energy has left I see including the heart yeah okay so I was I was actually very close
*  to death um so were you like on an IV and sorry oh yeah oh I was on everything I was uh yeah I
*  my body just was um nowhere near where it needed to be I was on all kinds of IVs my electrolytes
*  were just horribly imbalanced my liver problems I had heart problems I had um osteoporosis I
*  had everything that you could think of I was you know 21 um should be in great health so I was yeah
*  um but yeah I I had to I was under careful care for a long time because I I was quite close to
*  death um you know I remember that um my heart rate was really high so my resting heart rate was
*  I don't know maybe 120 and I'd brush my teeth in the morning and when I'd get up to brush my teeth
*  my heart rate would go up to 160 180 the alarms would go off the nurses would come running in
*  to see if I'm okay and I'm just standing there brushing my teeth you know so um there was a lot
*  of recovery that had to occur over over those six weeks and so it's six six weeks and then you did
*  you go immediately back to graduate school how how's that process getting back in to graduate
*  school and the flow of things and and just moving forward so probably wouldn't surprise people to
*  know that I was analyzing data while I was in the hospital and that sounds terrible but I I needed
*  something yeah um and I I did a lot of reading I read novels um I tried to you know relax as much
*  as I could but I also needed to forget my situation sometimes and I love brains and memory and data
*  and it wasn't that I felt pressured it was I needed to to do something um but I did take a good chunk
*  of time I was away not just the rest of the quarter but also a good chunk of the summer
*  um did a lot of time to try to build hobbies and sign my friend groups and so on
*  and then was was back um this happened about in April and so I was back in in graduate school at
*  the end of September. And this you know your personal experiences must have um had a lasting
*  effect and continuing effect on how you run your lab and probably your sensitivity to students needs
*  I would imagine. Would you say that I mean stupid question but has it had a large effect on
*  just you know how you run your lab and how you take care of your own self these days and the
*  memory for that and mindfulness of that is that a constant sort of um inner reflection?
*  Yeah that experience was um so awful for me as as you'd imagine it was um not just the
*  hospital but everything before that the memory of that you know for some people it sounds like oh
*  that was you know more than 10 years ago it's old you're probably fine now but that doesn't go away
*  so that um the unpleasantness of those experiences is something that um it's still very difficult
*  for me to talk about and uh is a good reminder for me to never go back to that place again
*  um so as negative as those memories are they are a very powerful deterrent for ever returning
*  to that place and I'm a lot better now at um leaning on my partner and my family and my social
*  support group so that I don't return to that place. And I hope that has made me a better mentor and
*  more um aware of people's needs and the importance of mental health and self-care.
*  I'm very open in talking about it and I try to be supportive of people. I've had some moments that
*  I'm not proud of especially when I was early in my um assistant professor career where there's so
*  much pressure. Oh so much to produce. Yeah I mean I remember seeing people like running you know
*  new faculty members sweating and running through the hallway to there it just seems so so high
*  pressured and so that has like got to be the worst situation for uh someone who's gone through
*  something like you have to be and let you know let me throw myself into this even harder more
*  pressure situation. Yeah and I think what I'm not proud of is that I let the pressure that I feel
*  kind of leak over to my trainees where in hindsight I should have been easier on them. I should have
*  given more time and less pressure um and I that's that's one of my my biggest regrets is I think
*  that um the pressure to produce should have been something that was on me and contained enough
*  that I didn't um that I respected my trainees needs for mental health time a little bit more.
*  I'm better at it now both because I realized that my past self um was maybe putting a little
*  bit too much pressure on my trainees and also because the further you go in your career the
*  more you kind of like let up you know it's like okay I got that paper out you know I got that
*  grant maybe I can relax a little bit more. You kind of see that um over the long haul it's uh it's
*  a marathon not a sprint or something is that the but how do you get around feeling like it's a it
*  is a sprint in the beginning though right? It kind of is um I those first few years I think
*  there's just so much pressure to write all the grants write all the papers like get the data
*  from your lab just get going um and I just don't know how to take away some of that pressure
*  How's the tenure going? Are you tenure-tracked yet?
*  I'm not tenured yet um so that's coming up in the next couple of years. I'm at the point where
*  you know I know I've been trying my best um and that if that's not good enough then I've at least
*  give it gave it all I got and I'm not willing to to give any more than I have so hopefully it's
*  enough. You know we talked about you not knowing what psychology was early on and of course I
*  didn't know what neuroscience was early on and I'm pretty sure when I got into graduate school
*  I didn't know what tenure was so I was like so naive uh about academia and I suppose I still am.
*  I am too I I didn't really understand the difference between assistant associate and full
*  I still don't I still don't my faculty job.
*  Yeah it's I have a lot of learning to do as well there's a lot about academia that I didn't
*  understand. Yeah I um you know I wish I had something uh more comforting more profound to say um
*  I really appreciate you sharing your personal experience this is not something that we usually
*  talk about um or go into that much depth on on the podcast so I really uh appreciate that I'm sure
*  it's probably becoming more easy to talk about but I'm sure still difficult to talk about um and uh
*  you know I don't know if congratulations is the right word but I'm just happy that you're
*  moving continuing to move in the right direction uh I hope and
*  I'm glad that you came out of it and and you know sorry that you had to go through that.
*  Yeah I hope just by talking about it that it'll help other people who might be in similar situations
*  and maybe prevent people from living what I had to live through um so you know it's it's not
*  something that's easy for me to talk about there's a lot of details and I'm not sharing but hopefully
*  um and at least providing this part of my story I can try to help others. Even knowing probably
*  that um that there are experiences like yours someone who may be suffering through a similar
*  experience even that has got to be a just a shining light of hope I would imagine.
*  So when I first shared this story I um like you mentioned I wrote about it briefly at stories
*  in science and the outpouring of support and thanks I got was um it was very touching um
*  and it felt like maybe one of the most important things that I've ever done so um you know I've
*  come to think that you know my research is fine and some people like it some people probably don't
*  but I think I'll probably have a bigger impact in other areas um and I think one of those is
*  trying to be more open about mental health struggles and the fact that many people
*  experience them they're nothing to be ashamed of it's not something you can think yourself out of
*  um that when you're in it it's very difficult to to get out um and I think it's not you know
*  one person out of a hundred it's a lot of people you know in in a in a group of ten probably
*  what half might have had some mental health struggles um so I do think it's important to
*  talk about these things and um I received a lot of support for sharing some of my story and a lot of
*  people um I hope were helped by it and will continue to be helped by it well I appreciate
*  you being so open about it so thanks all right mariam I've taken you long enough I really
*  appreciate you um sharing so much of your personal story uh with me but then also um
*  congratulations and continued success uh on the science story as well and um I feel very optimistic
*  for your future uh science path because there seem to be many open questions to continue to tackle
*  thanks so much it was a real pleasure and thank you for giving me the chance to
