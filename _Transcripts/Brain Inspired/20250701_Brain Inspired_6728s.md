# BI 215 Xiao-Jing Wang: Theoretical Neuroscience Comes of Age
**Brain Inspired:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI)
*  So it becomes actually really a puzzle, right? If you assume that, you know, different areas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=0.0s)]
*  are made of the same stuff, and they all talk to each other in a dense network, how do you [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=10.22s)]
*  get differentiation of function reading? You can think about bifurcations as a mathematical [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=17.66s)]
*  machinery to create knowledge. Now, let me make one more sweeping statement. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=27.0s)]
*  I'll make four more. Come on. Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=34.92s)]
*  This is Brain Inspired, powered by the transmitter. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=37.72s)]
*  Xiaojing Wang is the director of the Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at NYU, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=50.64s)]
*  New York University, and he sent me some bio notes. I don't usually do biographical stuff, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=56.84s)]
*  but he sent me some bio notes and they're interesting. So here you go. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=62.44s)]
*  Xiaojing was born and grew up in China, spent eight years in Belgium studying theoretical [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=65.68s)]
*  physics, areas like nonlinear dynamical systems and deterministic chaos. And as he says it, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=71.84s)]
*  he arrived from Brussels to California as a postdoc and in one day switched from French [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=78.84s)]
*  to English language, from European to American culture, and from physics to neuroscience. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=85.2s)]
*  Okay, so I know Xiaojing as a legend in non-human primate neurophysiology and modeling theoretical [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  neuroscience and having paved the way for the rest of us to study brain activity related [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=99.64s)]
*  to cognitive functions like working memory and decision making. He has just released [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  his new textbook called Theoretical Neuroscience Understanding Cognition, which covers things [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=110.5s)]
*  that textbooks cover. In this case, he covers the history and the current research on modeling [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=118.04s)]
*  cognitive functions from the very simple to the very cognitive. The book is also somewhat [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=125.04s)]
*  philosophical arguing that we need to update our approach in neuroscience to explaining [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=130.54s)]
*  how brains function, essentially to go beyond Mars levels, the famous David Mars levels, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=136.54s)]
*  which we discuss in the episode, and instead to enter into what Xiaojing refers to as a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=144.34s)]
*  cross-level mechanistic explanatory pursuit, which again, we discuss that as well. I just [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  learned he even cites my own PhD research studying metacognition in non-human primates [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=158.78s)]
*  and also my postdoctoral research studying response inhibition right there, right in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=166.82s)]
*  the citations. So you know it's a great and worthy book. You can learn more about Xiaojing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=172.22s)]
*  and the book in the show notes. It was fun having one of my heroes on the podcast, and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=179.58s)]
*  I hope you enjoy our discussion. Xiaojing, I have the book Theoretical Neuroscience [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=185.62s)]
*  Understanding Cognition. That's a slightly ambitious subtitle. So there's a lot in this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  book. Were you asked to write this book or did you decide it's time to write this book? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=203.3s)]
*  Hi, Paul. It's great to be on a podcast. I decided to write this book actually for some [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=210.46s)]
*  time now. I guess probably it's a good time for a new textbook in the field. As you know, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=220.3s)]
*  neuroscience has developed tremendously over the last maybe two decades or so in terms [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=233.02s)]
*  of two developments, right? So you have new technological methods and as a result you [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=239.42s)]
*  get a lot of big data of all kinds. So there's this recognition that perhaps we need theory [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=246.94s)]
*  and modeling that go hand in hand with experimentation to help accelerate discoveries. At the same [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=252.94s)]
*  time, computational neuroscience field has matured, so maybe this is a good time for [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=260.18s)]
*  a new textbook. So if you don't mind me saying, at least from my matriculation in computational [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=269.58s)]
*  neuroscience, you already were a legend in the field when I began, and so I suppose you're [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=278.46s)]
*  still a legend in the field. And this is a single author book. Most textbooks are multiple [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=285.1s)]
*  authors, right? So that stands out in that respect. And I want to understand, you just [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=290.82000000000005s)]
*  alluded to how things have progressed and now we're in a regime of big data. Back when [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=300.18s)]
*  I was beginning, we were recording single neurons. You would lower a single electrode [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=306.22s)]
*  and get one or two or maybe three neurons for a recording session while your animal [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=311.54s)]
*  was performing a task. And that's sort of what I knew you from as well, studying working [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=318.54s)]
*  memory. And you were really early on in the computational neuroscience of working memory [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  and decision making. I would just like to ask you to reflect a little bit about what's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=329.82000000000005s)]
*  different today besides just that it's bigger and more, what's different today than from [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=337.54s)]
*  earlier on in your career? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=345.34s)]
*  Right. Well, as you said, right, back then, we're talking about maybe 30 years ago, 25 [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  years ago, most of the recordings from behaving animals writing an interesting task were about [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=358.42s)]
*  limited to one cell at a time. And perhaps I'm sure you agree, you are from the field, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=367.3s)]
*  that it's probably fair to say that studies of cognitive functions like working memory [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=375.7s)]
*  and decision making roughly started around the turn of the century. Before that, I would [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=380.82s)]
*  say most of the efforts in our field were about sensory coding, sensory information [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=388.1s)]
*  processing or movement, like central pattern generators in insects, for example. And what's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=394.46s)]
*  happening in between in a kind of more flexible deliberate process at a single cell level [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=402.5s)]
*  really started around before or after the turn of the century. You're thinking about [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=411.02s)]
*  like selective attention by the work of Bob Desmond, for example, right? Action selection [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=418.41999999999996s)]
*  by Jeff Schaal, perceptual decision making by Bill Nilsson, Mike Shetland, and economical [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=423.38s)]
*  decision making by people like Dale Lee and Paul Gnimcher. So they already happened roughly [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=431.34s)]
*  around that time. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=439.02s)]
*  That's true. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=440.26s)]
*  I think about that. So, and that frankly, in my mind, I think that's the most important [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=441.02s)]
*  thing in my mind that has not really been covered in a systematic way, in a pedagogical [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=448.02s)]
*  way, in a textbook. So that's what I tried to do in this book. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=453.02s)]
*  I'm not sure what percentage of textbooks have quoted Dr. Seuss, but the last chapter [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=460.02s)]
*  in your book has a Dr. Seuss quote, with your head full of brains and your shoes full of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=466.02s)]
*  feet, you're too smart to go down any not so good street. Man, I'm not a good Dr. Seuss [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=471.41999999999996s)]
*  here. But having you having said that you have this table in the last chapter that lists [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=477.58s)]
*  everything that you were just talking about it sort of in in a sort of order of like a [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=484.58s)]
*  hierarchical order of all the the tasks that have been used. Many of the tasks that have [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=489.82s)]
*  been used to study what you're alluding to here with the cognition. So it's a it's a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=497.09999999999997s)]
*  very thorough and modern, obviously, book. But so so why did you feel okay, so you felt [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=503.06s)]
*  like they just hadn't been put together? Our modern understanding of cognitive type tasks [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=512.14s)]
*  and theoretical notions? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=520.42s)]
*  Yeah, for computational neuroscience, that I think is something really important. You [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=523.94s)]
*  just mentioned tasks, you know, actually, being trained as a physicist, for me, it's [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=531.94s)]
*  also really a big change. When I started in neuroscience, even when I, you know, tried [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=539.9000000000001s)]
*  to build a model for working memory, I didn't really know much about behavioral psychology. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=549.3800000000001s)]
*  So I didn't really pay too much attention on behavioral performance, right? Gradually, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=554.94s)]
*  I think that's true for many people from physics or mathematics, right? You say, oh, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=560.38s)]
*  this is a neural network model, which is, you know, some kind of physical dynamical [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=565.34s)]
*  system. So I'm interested in skill free dynamics, I'm interested in oscillations, right? Dynamical [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=570.06s)]
*  phenomena without thinking too much about tasks. Right? So that that is for me, a really [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=578.02s)]
*  very interesting, personally, you know, change and gradually how you appreciate, you know, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=584.4200000000001s)]
*  the tradition and, you know, in psychology, right? And how people design tasks to really [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=592.5400000000001s)]
*  get to the specific questions of how brain works. And I do think, you know, as you know, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=599.1s)]
*  you know, computational science is very cross disciplinary, right? You know, each time I [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=607.5400000000001s)]
*  teach a course, there are always some students from physics or mathematics who didn't know [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=613.22s)]
*  anything about the brain. Or, of course, also a few experimentalists to trending biology [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=619.6999999999999s)]
*  with a relatively weak math background. So, you know, I thought it's good to, right? Kind [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=626.54s)]
*  of inspiring in a way in teaching how important it is really to think about behavior. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=635.26s)]
*  Yeah, you highlight that a lot in the book. But so do these students come in from physics [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=642.26s)]
*  these days and have the same appreciation that you did, like where a sort of ignorance [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=647.02s)]
*  of the behavior or no, not a focus on the behavior and the psychological aspects of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=652.46s)]
*  these things. And you try to hammer that into them. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=658.02s)]
*  That depends. Right. This day is maybe more students are interesting now field because [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=660.62s)]
*  of AI, because machine learning. But I would say it's probably still the case. It's still [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=666.78s)]
*  common at least, right? People from quantitative fields may not, you know, have had exposure [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=674.86s)]
*  to this richness of behavior, right? And brain function. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=682.9s)]
*  But people that are interested in AI might be more interested in benchmarks, which is [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=689.6999999999999s)]
*  different than behavior. I'm not sure if that's a nuanced difference. What do you think about [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=694.54s)]
*  that? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=702.66s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I mean, that is about performance, right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=703.8199999999999s)]
*  Performance. That's a very general term, but yes. Okay. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=708.66s)]
*  Performance of what? Right. So, you know, I guess the different people are interested [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=711.8199999999999s)]
*  in different things. And that's the other thing I found interesting. I think that's [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=717.42s)]
*  interesting. Perhaps we can discuss, you know, in this dialogue, namely, in some sense, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=724.54s)]
*  we're a bit schizophrenic when we talk about the brain. And I'll tell you what I mean. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=733.26s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=737.62s)]
*  So of course, we all know, right, that different mental processes, different functions, somehow [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=738.62s)]
*  depend on different parts of the brain. We know that for vision, we know that for audition. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=748.26s)]
*  We know that for motor behavior. But very often when we talk about quote unquote, neuron [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=754.78s)]
*  computation, generically, for example, right? When we talk about the relationship between [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=761.78s)]
*  the brain and AI, we kind of stood that way, right? We kind of don't really emphasize functional [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=766.9399999999999s)]
*  specialization. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=777.14s)]
*  Modularity? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=778.26s)]
*  Like modularity, right? So, right, you know, you can, for example, you can maybe do a survey, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=779.26s)]
*  right, for the general public or even for AI researchers. How much do they know about [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=788.1s)]
*  the differences between the, you know, the ventral stream of the visual system that were [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=795.5s)]
*  the original inspiration of the convolutional neural networks and the dorsal stream, right? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=803.58s)]
*  What are the differences and why? How to explain the differences? I bet very few people [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=809.14s)]
*  really, really think hard on that, right? So that's what I mean by, you know, we know [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=815.14s)]
*  that they're different, but still perhaps it's good to, you know, really discuss diving [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=820.14s)]
*  into more depth, right? How different parts of the brain really can subserve different [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=828.1s)]
*  functions, right? That's the question of modularity. Does that make sense? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=835.38s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=840.38s)]
*  Does that make sense to you? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=841.38s)]
*  Yeah, yes. I mean, so I immediately want to ask you now about like working memory. So, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=843.38s)]
*  so I sort of think of you as being famous for working memory and then revisiting a lot [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=849.38s)]
*  of your historical work, you're famous for a lot of things. But one of the things that [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=855.14s)]
*  you talk about is that, you know, there are lots of circuits, lots of areas that have [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=860.02s)]
*  working memory types of, what you would think of as working memory types of activity within [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=865.42s)]
*  the circuitry throughout the brain. And this speaks to the modularity that you were just [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=871.74s)]
*  discussing. Is that a good example, do you think, to illustrate the modularity? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=876.26s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. So as you know, in neuroscience, you know, usually we get a hint from the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=882.26s)]
*  damaged patients, patients with damaged brain, right? So, and then later on, you know, you [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=890.86s)]
*  could do legions, careful legion studies. And those studies point to the role of, say, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=898.18s)]
*  the prefrontal cortex in working memory, right? And that led people like Fuster and Patricia [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=906.34s)]
*  Gondrakevich, right, to put the electrode into the prefrontal cortex in behaving animals, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=913.82s)]
*  performing a working memory task. It's very nice because all you do in delayed response [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=920.82s)]
*  task is not to allow animal to respond right away to a stimulus, but you have to hold in [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=927.82s)]
*  mind in working memory, maybe do something about it during a delay period before you [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=934.1800000000001s)]
*  can perform a memory guided response. Right. And we should maybe define working [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=940.78s)]
*  memory as a sort of temporary memory, but also information processing within that temporary [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=946.1s)]
*  hold. Right. Yeah, the key is that it's not enslaved [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=952.6999999999999s)]
*  by environment. So it's something internal, right? So when you see some working memory [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=956.26s)]
*  signals, they are not directly driven by external input. It's during a time when you kind of [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=962.38s)]
*  hold something in your mind. And so that's really interesting in contrast to, say, you [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=969.62s)]
*  know, primary sensory neurons responding to stimulation. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=977.3s)]
*  Right. But our entire brain is highly recurrent. So these types of signals are basically kind [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=981.82s)]
*  of everywhere. There are some areas where it's more pronounced, I suppose. So speak [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=991.22s)]
*  to that for a moment. Yeah. Well, so there are multiple parts, you [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=996.5s)]
*  know, in addressing this puzzle, I would say it's still really a puzzle. Actually, it's [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1003.5s)]
*  becoming, I would say, one of the really key central questions today. And I'll explain [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1009.9s)]
*  to you why, I'll unpack a little bit. Right. So because these days, in contrast to what [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1018.14s)]
*  we said just earlier, that you could record from one cell at a time, today with the advances [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1026.14s)]
*  of tools like NeuronPixels, people record from thousands of single neurons in multiple [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1031.7s)]
*  brain regions at the same time, from animals doing some task. Right. And so people then [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1037.8200000000002s)]
*  analyze those data in different ways. For example, you can decode what's encoded in [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1046.0200000000002s)]
*  neuron activity in different parts of the brain and found that you can decode, say, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1053.18s)]
*  you know, working memory signals in many brain regions. Right. Okay. And that's very interesting. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1060.54s)]
*  So suggesting that working memory is distributed. Right. It also, I would say, creates some [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1068.54s)]
*  kind of confusion. Right. You know, we can ask a bunch of questions. We don't really [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1076.3s)]
*  know the answers to those questions. Why is that when you see some neuron signal in [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1081.66s)]
*  a area, right, you can ask, you know, how does that happen and why? Right. For example, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1089.26s)]
*  as you said, right, areas really interact with each other. If you just look at the connectomic [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1095.78s)]
*  measurements in the primate cortex, for example, right, about 67% of all possible connections [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1101.74s)]
*  are there. What I mean by this is that, say, if you have N areas, right, for each area, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1108.74s)]
*  you have N minus one possible long-distance connections. Right. So altogether you have [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1115.74s)]
*  N times N minus one possible connections. Yeah. Out of that, about 67% of all connections [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1119.74s)]
*  are there. I mean, the proportion is even higher in mice. People say 95%, 97%. I did [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1127.74s)]
*  not know that. Yeah. Huh. That's interesting. Wait. So that means it's more modular at quote [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1134.74s)]
*  unquote higher levels in the taxonomic tree, like in primates, non-human primates and human [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1141.74s)]
*  primates. That would make it more modular, right? So it would make the mouse brain more [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1148.74s)]
*  homogenous? Maybe. Yeah. But so you can, in principle, right, there are other things, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1152.74s)]
*  but just look at this connectomic measurements, you would say. You can go from anywhere to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1160.74s)]
*  anywhere else by one or two synapses, right? Okay. So is it possible, for example, just [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1166.74s)]
*  take an extreme example, right? Maybe in the end, working memory depends on only a few [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1173.74s)]
*  areas, but by virtue of interactions, some other areas, you know, are more likely to [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1180.74s)]
*  be connected. Other areas, you know, have some kind of working memory signals as a result [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1187.74s)]
*  of receivers, right, as receivers of projections from the core, right, for example, right? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1194.74s)]
*  That's a possibility, in principle. Yeah. Right? And then you can, of course, discuss [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1202.74s)]
*  functionally, is that a bug or is that useful, right? I think the brain would define the [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1210.74s)]
*  ways to use signals, depends on behavior demands, right? So those are the questions that people [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1218.14s)]
*  are starting to study, motivated by new data, right? Right. That is kind of an interesting, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1227.74s)]
*  that redundancy, I mean, von Neumann wrote about this as a feature of the brain, right, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1234.74s)]
*  redundancy, and how basically if you send a bunch of copies, then you reduce the noise. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1242.74s)]
*  That's a very short way of saying it. But what you were just saying reminded me of how [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1247.74s)]
*  power-efficient brains are and that it might not be such a cost, actually, if you have [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1254.74s)]
*  that extra stuff outside the core. Right. But like, if you have memory signals in V1, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1261.74s)]
*  how do you use that? Sure. Yeah. I was going to ask you, where is working memory then? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1273.74s)]
*  By the way, actually, I'm not so sure. I mean, redundancy certainly is desirable for several [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1279.74s)]
*  reasons. But I also want to say that what I just told you could be understood a bit in [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1287.74s)]
*  terms of this old notion of equipotentiality by Lashley. Remember, he kind of visioned [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1295.82s)]
*  bigger and bigger parts of the brain, right? Oh, it's more or less doing the same thing. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1302.82s)]
*  I actually don't believe that, right? So that's actually the puzzle we try to study and try [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1308.22s)]
*  to kind of propose some solutions. So you take two premises. One is that you have this [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1313.58s)]
*  long range connections. By the way, that's also very different, in my mind, fundamental [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1319.78s)]
*  difference between neural circuits and the physical systems. In physical systems, interactions [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1326.9s)]
*  are local. What do you mean physical systems? Well, like molecules. So interactions are [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1331.46s)]
*  by collision or chemical reactions. They are local interactions. And that's very different [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1339.46s)]
*  in the brain circuits where you have this long range connections that allow you to go [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1346.46s)]
*  to different places. So this is number one. Number one premise. The second premise is [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1353.98s)]
*  the notion of canonical circuits. Right. So Mountcastle canonical microcircuitry in the [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1360.3s)]
*  cortex. Exactly. So David Hubel, Tolston Wiesel, and later Kevin Martin, Rodney Douglas. And [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1368.3s)]
*  it's a very elegant principle. So basically, the cortex is made of the same stuff. It just [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1382.34s)]
*  repeats, more and more repeats of the same local canonical circuit. And if we figure [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1389.5s)]
*  out what one of those little microcircuits are doing, then we have solved the cortex. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1395.7s)]
*  Yeah. That's the goal. Exactly. And also across species, right? From rodents to monkeys and [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1400.14s)]
*  humans. So that's a very powerful, elegant idea, and people love it. But then if you [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1407.38s)]
*  take those two premises, it's become even more kind of no trivial. How do you explain [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1412.3400000000001s)]
*  modularity? Right? Functional modularity, by the way. People use the term modularity [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1419.3400000000001s)]
*  in different ways. People who use graph theory, for example. When you think about a graph, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1424.46s)]
*  applied to neural networks, or even the brain connective. The physical structure. You mean [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1431.94s)]
*  right? The physical structure. Yeah. Network science. When you see a graph, actually implicitly, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1437.94s)]
*  you kind of think about nodes being all the same. Right. And what differ is input and [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1446.8600000000001s)]
*  outputs. Well, also, I mean, there are connectivity differences, right? Small world network, et [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1454.34s)]
*  cetera. Yeah, that's input and outputs. Right? So each node has different inputs, different [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1461.34s)]
*  outputs. Right? But the nodes are all the same. So in that sense, it's a bit like canonical [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1467.34s)]
*  local circuit idea. Right? Okay. So of course, they use the word modules modularity in different [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1474.34s)]
*  ways. So I want to just be clear. What I mean by modularity, I mean functional modularity. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1481.5s)]
*  Right? Like working memory. Right? It's a module dedicated to working memory. Right? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1487.5s)]
*  So it becomes actually really a puzzle. Right? If you assume that different areas are made [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1495.74s)]
*  of the same stuff, and they all talk to each other in a dense network, how do you get differentiation [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1502.4199999999998s)]
*  of function really? I mean, I know that you have multiple answers to this, and it actually [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1510.42s)]
*  doesn't take much. Well, perhaps you could enlighten us how that would work then. We [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1517.26s)]
*  don't know the answer. We do try hard over the last years to build different models. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1525.74s)]
*  But in principle, I think that we do know the answer. Right? I mean, the answer is that [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1532.74s)]
*  not all cortical columns are the same because they express different proteins and even these [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1540.82s)]
*  nuanced differences then give rise to different function within the cortical column. Right? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1546.68s)]
*  And then the modularity itself, the connectivity itself, one cortical column is receiving inputs [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1554.42s)]
*  from these 14 different areas, and another cortical column is receiving inputs from 12 [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1560.84s)]
*  of those and one of these. And so there is differentiation just with the input-output [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1567.6s)]
*  structure, just as you were saying. I thought that's what you were going to talk about. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1572.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, great. You know, that certainly is, as some other people say, you know, just maybe [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1578.3999999999999s)]
*  the canonical circuit idea is appealing but not sufficient. Right? So maybe it's actually [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1585.68s)]
*  not true that different parts of the cortex are the same. Right? Of course, we see all [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1593.16s)]
*  kinds of differences. In these days, with the new transcriptomic data, connectomic data, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1597.88s)]
*  all kinds of data point to that direction. Right? So you say, oh, you know, it's just [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1605.92s)]
*  not true. There are heterogeneities. I don't know if you know this. For example, in primates, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1611.1s)]
*  of course in the cortex, there are excitatory neurons, T-amid cells and inhibitory neurons. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1619.5s)]
*  Right? And in V1, about 15% of neurons are inhibitory. Right? 85% of neurons are excitatory. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1625.1799999999998s)]
*  In the PFC, actually, there are twice as many inhibited neurons. Prefrontal cortex, which [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1632.18s)]
*  if you think of the brain as a feed-forward input-output system, the prefrontal cortex [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1644.02s)]
*  is at the top of that hierarchy in the cortex. Yeah. So the prefrontal cortex or PFC is the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1648.54s)]
*  part of the cortex right above your eyes, like in the front. And that has been kind [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1655.62s)]
*  of mysterious for a long time. And only in recent decades, we start to realize how important [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1662.1399999999999s)]
*  it is for cognitive functions and executive control of behavior. Sometimes it's called [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1670.22s)]
*  a CEO of the brain. Right? Right. Right. So I actually want to contrast sometimes PFC [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1677.22s)]
*  with primary sensory area like V1. Right? And just to say the difference is quite marked. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1684.22s)]
*  Well, that's one big difference is just the number of inhibitory neurons, as you just [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1690.26s)]
*  said, is 15% to how high is it in prefrontal cortex? 30%. 30%. So what does, you hear all [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1695.94s)]
*  the time that excitation inhibition balance is key to neural functioning. So what does [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1703.38s)]
*  that difference mean functionally between those areas? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1708.34s)]
*  Well, so I guess people still try to figure it out. We have some, we've done some research, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1713.34s)]
*  try to adjust this question. In fact, it's something if you don't mind, I can dive into [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1725.34s)]
*  a bit of detail. I think it's probably interesting for your audience for several reasons. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1730.98s)]
*  So we talk about working memory, right? So when we try to build a model for working memory, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1738.6599999999999s)]
*  we were worried about how you can ignore destructors. When you try to hold something in your mind, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1744.6599999999999s)]
*  it's really hard to ignore intruding signals that are not relevant. Right? So that can [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1750.6999999999998s)]
*  be either external stimulation. It can also be some internal thoughts that you should [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1759.26s)]
*  ignore. Right? So by chance, this was like 20 years ago, so we published a paper in 2004. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1764.58s)]
*  By chance at that time, I was talking to an anatomist from Hungary called Thomas Freund. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1778.3s)]
*  So we used to think about inhibitory neurons targeting accessory neurons, controlling accessory [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1786.9399999999998s)]
*  neurons. He was telling me that they just discovered a group of inhibitory neurons that [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1793.94s)]
*  avoid pyramidal cells. They don't target E-cells. And that was a big surprise to him. That was [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1799.18s)]
*  in hippocampus. And then I read more about some bits of anatomical evidence. And it turns [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1807.42s)]
*  out that those guys that avoid the pyramidal cells target another class of inhibitory neurons. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1816.8200000000002s)]
*  A different class than their own. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1824.78s)]
*  A second class of inhibitory neurons. And those second class of inhibitory neurons target dendrites [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1827.14s)]
*  of pyramidal cells. So they're actually controlling input flow to pyramidal cells. So if this second [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1833.78s)]
*  type is very active, it will just block, gate out input flow to pyramidal cells. And then [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1845.22s)]
*  is that for sparsity? Is that for us an efficient coding kind of scheme? You mentioned hippocampus [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1854.18s)]
*  and you need sparsity in parts of the hippocampus. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1859.38s)]
*  We first found that kind of cells that avoid pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. But I [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1861.8200000000002s)]
*  thought that may be a way for gating. So that gives some names. The one that Freund discovered [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1870.3400000000001s)]
*  can be labeled by some biomarker. This states VIP neurons or carotene as a marker. And that's [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1877.34s)]
*  called interneuron targeting neurons. And then the second type can be labeled by somatostatin [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1888.98s)]
*  or carbendin. And they target dendrites. So again, if they're active, they can just be [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1900.1799999999998s)]
*  blocking inputs to pyramidal cells. But if for some reason the first type, the VIP neurons [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1907.34s)]
*  are active, they would suppress som in the neurons, thereby opening the gate. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1915.82s)]
*  Yeah, this is a concept like disinhibition, which is I still, it's a not-not. So it's [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1924.3799999999999s)]
*  hard to even conceptualize. And it happens in the basal ganglia circuitry a lot. But [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1932.22s)]
*  disinhibiting something, for some reason for my human brain, I have to pause and think [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1939.38s)]
*  about it for a second. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1945.22s)]
*  And this one is more about dendrites, about inputs on the pyramidal cells. So we built [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1948.66s)]
*  a model with actually three types of inhibiting neurons. Those two and then the third one [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1955.66s)]
*  in turn actually controls the spiking output of pyramidal cells. So you have the ones that [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1962.66s)]
*  are labeled by som that control the inputs. And the other one, PV neurons that control [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1970.02s)]
*  the spiking outputs of pyramidal cells. And then the third one is the spiking output of [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1978.46s)]
*  the pyramidal cells. And so this motif with three kinds of neurons, I don't know how many [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1986.0600000000002s)]
*  people really know it, was first proposed theoretically in the modeling paper. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1991.18s)]
*  So I can link to it in the show notes. This was 2003, you said? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=1999.9s)]
*  2004. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2004.18s)]
*  2004, okay. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2005.18s)]
*  Yeah. And then nowadays with genetic tools, people have established this motif basically [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2006.18s)]
*  universally across the whole cortex. But then just back to your point, maybe different [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2013.18s)]
*  parts of the cortex have different needs for output control and input control. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2022.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2029.18s)]
*  Right? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2030.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2031.18s)]
*  Now think about the primary visual cortex, maybe there are a few sources of inputs, but [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2032.18s)]
*  in PFC there's this huge convergence of inputs around pyramidal cells in PFC. So maybe you [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2039.8600000000001s)]
*  need more input controlling inhibiting neurons in PFC than in early sensory areas. That's [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2049.02s)]
*  exactly what you find. And so the proportion of input controlling versus output controlling [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2056.2200000000003s)]
*  in the neurons is very different from area to area. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2063.5s)]
*  Does the, okay, so it goes from inhibitory neurons, sorry to backtrack a little bit, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2066.9s)]
*  go from 15% in primary visual cortex, which is the early visual cortical areas, up to [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2072.7200000000003s)]
*  30% in prefrontal cortex. Does it increase linearly along that gradient? One thing that [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2078.46s)]
*  we know is that there are longer and longer time scales as you go from early sensory areas [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2089.38s)]
*  to prefrontal cortical areas, which tracks, I suppose, with the percentage of inhibitory [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2095.14s)]
*  neurons. But is there a jump in there or does it just increase along that axis? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2104.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. So when people say there are a lot of heterogeneities, it's [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2110.66s)]
*  interesting to quantify, right? So is it just random heterogeneity that kind of hygromagic [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2117.8199999999997s)]
*  dimensional distribution, right? Or is there some, alternatively, some systematical change [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2125.14s)]
*  along some low dimensional axis? And so we and others, like John Murray, have used different [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2134.3399999999997s)]
*  kinds of data to address that question, including the inhibitory neuron proportion and all kinds [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2142.02s)]
*  of things like even transcriptomic data. And we found that the answer is the latter. So [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2150.02s)]
*  in fact, there are systematic changes of biological properties along certain low dimensional axis, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2156.42s)]
*  which we now call the macroscopic gradient. So, by the way, there are two slightly different [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2167.22s)]
*  things here, right? One is the proportion of inhibitory neurons relative to accepted [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2174.9399999999996s)]
*  neurons. The other one is among the inhibitory neurons, what's the proportion of neurons [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2179.98s)]
*  that control inputs and what's the proportion of neurons that control the outputs, right? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2185.3799999999997s)]
*  But anyway, they all show pretty systematic macroscopic gradients, which is nice because [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2190.5s)]
*  you quantify them, so you have numbers, right? So then you can build a model of the large [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2197.78s)]
*  scale model, which is, I think, still very new, but promising. So basically you say, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2205.54s)]
*  I don't invent connectivity, we just use connectomic measurements to build a multi-regional large [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2212.78s)]
*  scale, say, macaque cortex, right? And then you introduce gradients of synaptic [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2219.1s)]
*  excitation or inhibition, right? That ensure that you have some graded differences in different [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2227.5s)]
*  cortical areas. Mathematically, right? It means that you should use the same equations for [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2237.26s)]
*  each local area, that's the canonical part. And then the heterogeneity part is to say, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2245.18s)]
*  well, even if you use the same equation, the values of parameters may change, right? And [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2251.78s)]
*  so it's kind of a disciplined way, at least, to try to build a biologically constrained [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2258.78s)]
*  model. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2265.78s)]
*  So I'm sorry to take this as an aside, but as you're speaking, I realized you were so [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2267.86s)]
*  early in... So computational... When I think of neuroscience now, I think, oh, it's all [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2274.1000000000004s)]
*  computational neuroscience. When you began, it was not. There was very little computational [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2278.94s)]
*  neuroscience and you were one of the original people who ushered in theoretical ideas, mathematical [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2285.94s)]
*  models into neuroscience. I mean, can you reflect just a moment? Do I have it right [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2292.94s)]
*  that now it seems like it's all computational? Do you feel justified? Did you come into neuroscience [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2299.42s)]
*  and think, oh, these biological stamp collectors, I'm going to fix this? What was that like [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2305.58s)]
*  back then? Did you feel alone in your endeavors? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2312.78s)]
*  Thank you. I guess... So when I teach a course, I sometimes say that the field... They're [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2318.58s)]
*  always pioneers, right? In any field. I'm thinking about people like Hodgkin-Hoxley, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2327.78s)]
*  who built the Hodgkin-Hoxley model, and then applied the mathematicians like John Rinzel, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2333.1800000000003s)]
*  Will Rowe, Barton-Montchall, Nancy Coppell. But as a field, perhaps it really started [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2340.1800000000003s)]
*  when data collection came to a point. And then people like David Maher, coming from [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2351.3s)]
*  a more functional perspective, pushed the idea of using mathematical models to try to [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2359.3s)]
*  understand how the brain works. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2367.5s)]
*  I want to ask you about David Maher again in a moment. But you said it happened when [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2368.94s)]
*  data collection began, but I saw that... [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2376.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, okay, maybe I'm framing slightly differently. So I guess in my mind, I think it's a little [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2381.1000000000004s)]
*  bit different. But the point is that when the systems neuroscience is developed to some [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2388.3s)]
*  point, in our case, you had Monte Carlo, human whistle, etc. And then you start to use math. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2396.86s)]
*  Again, combined maybe with mathematical psychology, you use signal detection theory, you use a [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2409.54s)]
*  point process. So you start to use mathematical tools to analyze. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2418.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Very simple. Well, I won't say simple, but very small models. You'd call [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2422.5s)]
*  these small models. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2428.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And then you use information theory to quantify coding. And then there are people [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2429.46s)]
*  who like Eve Mather, try to look at rhythms, underlying motor behavior, start to use dynamics [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2436.54s)]
*  systems theory. So I would say those are examples, early examples. And then again, think about [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2448.46s)]
*  Hutchings-Huxley, Rowe and Renzel. It's more neurophysiology, which is always very quantitative. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2455.6600000000003s)]
*  So I came from the background of dynamical systems theory and statistical physics. But [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2466.46s)]
*  just by chance, in a way, I got into the prefrontal cortex very early on. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2472.6200000000003s)]
*  What do you mean by chance? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2478.6200000000003s)]
*  It's a bit accidental. So when I switched to neuroscience, I was in an experimental [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2481.82s)]
*  lab of Walter Freeman at UC Berkeley. I don't know if you know that his father was the infamous [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2489.1000000000004s)]
*  person who performed frontal lobotomy. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2496.1s)]
*  Oh, no. Okay. I did not know that. Infamous. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2499.1s)]
*  Infamous. He actually performed thousands of cases. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2502.1s)]
*  He would drive through the eye, ice pick frontal lobotomy? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2507.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2511.1s)]
*  He was the one who would drive all the cars from state to state and offer as a treatment. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2512.1s)]
*  And he was the one who performed frontal lobotomy on Rosemary Kennedy, the sister of [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2519.1s)]
*  John Kennedy. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2526.1s)]
*  He performed that. And Walter Freeman was his son? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2527.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2530.1s)]
*  Gosh, do you know how Walter Freeman thought about all that? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2531.1s)]
*  I don't remember if we had really that conversation. Anyway, I heard about PFC and maybe it's [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2534.1s)]
*  important to understand in psychiatry. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2544.1s)]
*  That's hilarious that you came to PFC because we were lopping off PFC and someone's dad [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2549.1s)]
*  was getting rid of PFC, the thing that's not important. And you thought maybe that's important. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2556.1s)]
*  Well, it's true. It's terrible. So like Rosemary Kennedy, she had a procedure when she was [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2562.1s)]
*  like 23 and that failed miserably. So she could not function afterwards. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2570.1s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know much about her, but I've heard that it was bad particularly for her. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2577.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2582.1s)]
*  She lived in an institution for more than five decades. It was a terrible example. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2583.1s)]
*  I just showed we didn't know anything about what PFC is good for. And then actually in [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2589.1s)]
*  Pittsburgh, I actually started my first faculty position in Pittsburgh. I got to know David [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2594.1s)]
*  Lewis. He told me about PFC in a more scientific way. And that's actually how I learned that [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2601.1s)]
*  PFC is important in psychiatry because apparently all major psychiatric disorders somehow involve [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2610.1s)]
*  abnormal PFC. And it was him. He introduced me to Patricia Golden-Rakish. And so that's [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2618.1s)]
*  how I got into... [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2629.1s)]
*  I see. Yeah. So just to pause there, Patricia Golden-Rakish, I mean, this is the way I was [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2630.1s)]
*  taught about working memory also, recorded neural activity in the prefrontal cortex of [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2636.1s)]
*  monkeys performing a working memory task. And the old story was that you would have these [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2642.1s)]
*  single neurons that when the monkey is holding something in its working memory would have [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2647.1s)]
*  this persistent activity. And so you'd have a single neuron that would start becoming [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2653.1s)]
*  active when there was no stimulus and the monkey is trying to hold something in mind. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2659.1s)]
*  And it would be active until the monkey was cued to respond to indicate the answer of [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2663.1s)]
*  its working memory content. And that was the story of working memory back then. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2674.1s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Again, there were others, right? Like Fooster and Motonabi in Japan. But Golden-Rakish, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2679.1s)]
*  I think, was kind of unique because she really tried to use multiple approaches to get to [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2690.1s)]
*  the mechanistic understanding across levels. So not only in her lab, they did single unit [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2700.1s)]
*  recording in the working memory task, as they described, but also she did brain imaging, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2709.1s)]
*  she did in-vitro slice, and she trained as an anatomist, also did a lot of kind of [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2717.1s)]
*  anatomical analysis. So I guess that's her really unique contribution, really trying to use [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2724.1s)]
*  multiple approaches to try to understand the mechanisms. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2730.1s)]
*  Okay. Well, you've just cued me now to go back to David Maher. And so let's talk about [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2734.1s)]
*  cross-level mechanisms, which is one of the unique things about your textbook is that it's not just [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2740.1s)]
*  a textbook, it's sort of a calling for ways to approach the brain. And so we've talked about [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2747.1s)]
*  David Maher a lot on this podcast, but just to sort of recap, and you mentioned David Maher earlier, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2756.1s)]
*  his approach became popular in the neurosciences thinking about how to understand brains, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2761.1s)]
*  how to explain brain activity in brains. And there are three famous Mars levels, right? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2769.1s)]
*  You have your computational level, computational slash functional level, which is like, what is the task? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2777.1s)]
*  What is the object of the cognitive activity? You have the algorithmic slash representational level. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2784.1s)]
*  What are the steps that the brain has to do to get to accomplish that task? And then you have the [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2792.1s)]
*  implementation level, which is just how do the neurons act? How do the neurons carry out the function [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2797.1s)]
*  to carry out these algorithms, to carry out the task? And one of the things that you argue very early on [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2804.1s)]
*  in the first chapter of the book is that we should go beyond Mars levels now. Why is that? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2811.1s)]
*  I guess historically, maybe let me talk a bit about sociological aspect of David Maher first, right? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2818.1s)]
*  Historically, back then in the early 80s, when he proposed the three levels, by the way, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2826.1s)]
*  he's actually initially proposed three levels together with Tommy Poggio. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2834.1s)]
*  Poggio, I'm going to have Tommy on at some point. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2839.1s)]
*  Yeah, yes, please ask him. I had a conversation with him, so it's interesting. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2842.1s)]
*  I guess there are kind of two motivations. One was that back then, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2852.1s)]
*  neurobiologists didn't really think too much about behavior, frankly. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2858.1s)]
*  So a lot of people try to understand how single neurons work, how snap transmission work. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2864.1s)]
*  And for that, you can do a lot of in vitro slice studies, because there's no behavior in the slides. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2870.1s)]
*  Right. And that's true, I guess. I mean, you could call that kind of stamp collecting, but so. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2880.1s)]
*  It's just not about behavior, right? And even when you record in vivo back then, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2887.1s)]
*  very often you record from anesthetized animals. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2895.1s)]
*  Yeah, but you're not asking. So you're not asking anything about behavior. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2899.1s)]
*  You're trying to figure out how the stuff works, which is a very valid and necessary thing. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2902.1s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. I guess. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2908.1s)]
*  But I guess David Ma and his friends feel like, you know, as a complementary approach, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2912.1s)]
*  maybe, you know, you can study behavior without worrying too much about implementation. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2922.1s)]
*  Right. So they say, OK, vision is really hard. Right. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2929.1s)]
*  How do I understand the stereo vision? That's first defined. Right. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2934.1s)]
*  Stereo vision, right. Quantitatively. And and that's the function part. Right. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2940.1s)]
*  And then let's try to propose some mathematical algorithm. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2947.1s)]
*  And that's the software part. Yeah. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2952.1s)]
*  How to accomplish it despite whatever whatever the stuff is made of underlying it, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2955.1s)]
*  despite the whether it's brain material, computer material. Yeah. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2962.1s)]
*  Yeah. That's the third part. Right. Hardware. Right. OK. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2966.1s)]
*  So there's this function software and hardware. Right. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2971.1s)]
*  Actually, by the way, the second motivation was a bit sociological because apparently from Tommy back then, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2975.1s)]
*  people think that all you need to know is molecular biology. Yeah. Right. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2984.1s)]
*  Well, I don't I mean, yeah, from that was his perspective. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2989.1s)]
*  Yeah, it was a bit of that. And they say, you know, David Ma said, you know, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2994.1s)]
*  we can study behavior on its own merits. Right. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=2998.1s)]
*  And that makes sense. But I think over time, we have to read his original writing, actually. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3003.1s)]
*  Right. Over time, maybe by some people, maybe naively, somehow [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3010.1s)]
*  David's three levels as kind of understood or perceived a bit naively as like unidirectional hierarchy. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3017.1s)]
*  Right. So the most important is function, then software. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3027.1s)]
*  You know, if you are interested, at the end, you could worry about implementation. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3032.1s)]
*  That is the sort of common way. But do you think are we misreading that? Is that just folklore? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3037.1s)]
*  I don't think you remember that when you described it, you actually used the word just for how do I think culturally, I've been inundated with that sort of. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3043.1s)]
*  Yeah. So. Well, for one thing, I actually like to make an observation. Right. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3054.1s)]
*  So if, say, someone really just cares about function, right, let's say, A.I. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3062.1s)]
*  Right. It's good to notice the workhorse of today's A.I. systems. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3068.1s)]
*  Right. Is convolutional neural network deep neural networks. Well, I think it's transformers now. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3076.1s)]
*  But right. Sure. The last generation was convolutional neural networks. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3082.1s)]
*  Yeah. But deep neural network to start with. Right. Yeah. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3087.1s)]
*  So that's a software thing. Yeah. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3091.1s)]
*  But it was initially inspired by what we learned about the hardware of the visual system. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3095.1s)]
*  Yeah. That is so underappreciated, at least in the A.I. world. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3101.1s)]
*  It's hardware that we learned right from the visual system that was an inspiration for people like Yanlu Kun, right, to develop this kind of architecture. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3106.1s)]
*  And Fukushima. Yeah. So I mean, I can give you examples. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3117.1s)]
*  I would advocate that maybe we are not done yet by learning from neuroscience and especially, say, the proof of the cortex or those of stream right of the system. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3122.1s)]
*  So that's the other thing that I actually I'm not so sure it's so productive. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3134.1s)]
*  That is, people kind of believe that they can implement the same software with all kinds of different hardware. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3139.1s)]
*  Right. The functionalist viewpoint. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3148.1s)]
*  And that in part is because of the drawing analogy between the brain and the computer. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3152.1s)]
*  Right. So you can say, oh, a Turing machine can be implemented by, you know, the old fashioned vacuum tubes or by chips. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3158.1s)]
*  Right. OK. And I'm not so sure if that really is true, in fact. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3169.1s)]
*  And that a Turing machine. Isn't it true in principle? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3176.1s)]
*  That is true. No, no. I mean, about the brain functions. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3179.1s)]
*  About brain functions, I don't know to what extent that's really true. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3182.1s)]
*  I also don't know how fruitful, how productive that view is in brain research. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3186.1s)]
*  Right. Or maybe that. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3194.1s)]
*  Part of the joint analogy with a computer is not so interesting, so useful. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3200.1s)]
*  Do you always think that way or because you're an early computational neuroscientist, which and your bread and butter is thinking of the brain as a computer. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3205.1s)]
*  Right. In some sense, more as a kind of more as a dynamical system, actually. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3213.1s)]
*  Well, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3218.1s)]
*  I can tell you a bit more. How is that different from computer? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3222.1s)]
*  In my view, at least. Right. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3226.1s)]
*  So so but anyway, if you do care about how the brain works, right, I do think that we are in need of a new framework. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3229.1s)]
*  That's what I try to describe, although actually kind of briefly because the lack of space, happy to expand that view in the future. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3238.1s)]
*  Namely, we do have enough data and I think it's fruitful to try to go across levels. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3249.1s)]
*  Right. Maybe, you know, 30 years ago in David Moss time, it was not possible. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3255.1s)]
*  Right. But now I think it is possible and we have the obligation really try to benefit from big data in transcriptome in connectome. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3262.1s)]
*  Right. To understand function. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3274.1s)]
*  I mean, that's sort of the dream. Right. So so the so despite whether you go top down, you know, from function to implementation, which is the classic sense in which we we in writ large interpret David Marr or if you go bottom up. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3277.1s)]
*  The whole thing with David Marr was that will you keep these levels distinct and there's no need to go across levels. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3297.1s)]
*  And so you're arguing that now is the time to do this cross level mechanistic understanding. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3304.1s)]
*  I don't know if you say the word there's no need, but I think it's reasonable for him to say you can study one level on its own merit. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3312.1s)]
*  That's another way to put it. So that that that's I think valuable and important. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3323.1s)]
*  Right. But indeed, again, maybe over time, people misunderstood or naively took it in a too simplistic way. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3329.1s)]
*  Right. It's like, you know, one, you know, one directional hierarchy, which I think is not so necessarily fruitful now. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3340.1s)]
*  It depends on your goal. Right. I'm just saying it is a it is now really doable. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3349.1s)]
*  Actually, I just give you an example. Right. So ignoring destructors in working memory is a functional thing. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3358.1s)]
*  Right. And I kind of say that, in fact, you know, this disinhibiting motif right of three kinds of inter neurons is a not just implementation, but a. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3364.1s)]
*  Kind of specific circuit mechanism that potentially can explain gating. Right. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3377.1s)]
*  So then you can go across levels in that sense. So it is doable. Right. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3384.1s)]
*  So depending on your goal, I think very often it's worth trying this way. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3391.1s)]
*  Let me give you another example, if you don't mind, for my own experience. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3399.1s)]
*  That is about building a model for working memory. OK. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3403.1s)]
*  So you you may, I don't know, wonder how do I get into decision making. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3406.1s)]
*  Right. And that's in a way also is by accident. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3413.1s)]
*  How that happened. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3417.1s)]
*  Not lobotomies. You didn't get there by lobotomies. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3419.1s)]
*  It's basically our struggle. Right. So this is my struggle. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3421.1s)]
*  So when we build. So the idea of, you know, working memory signals representation. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3425.1s)]
*  Right. Is that it's maintained internally by recurrent interactions. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3430.1s)]
*  So it's not driven by external stimulation like neurons in V1. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3435.1s)]
*  Right. Like you and me. Right. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3440.1s)]
*  I talk to you. You talk to me. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3443.1s)]
*  If our voice is loud enough, not that loud enough. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3446.1s)]
*  Right. I talk to you. You talk to me. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3449.1s)]
*  If our voice is loud enough, not whispering too loudly, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3453.1s)]
*  we can keep going like what we're doing now without external input. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3457.1s)]
*  Right. So suppose that we are neurons. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3463.1s)]
*  Right. So that's the idea of reproferation. Right. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3466.1s)]
*  So if we were neurons, through this recurrent excitation, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3469.1s)]
*  we can maintain some activity that can maintain working memory. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3473.1s)]
*  Right. You know, freed from the environment, so to speak. Right. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3477.1s)]
*  Yeah. And that's a key. Right. That we try to test qualitatively. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3482.1s)]
*  When we build a model, you have to crank up the strength of excitation model. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3488.1s)]
*  Right. OK. So we either didn't get person's activity. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3494.1s)]
*  So we could not have a working memory circuit. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3498.1s)]
*  Or everything blows up. Right. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3502.1s)]
*  When the excitation is too powerful, you have this runaway excitation. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3506.1s)]
*  Right. You say, oh, well, maybe you should also crank up the inhibition. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3511.1s)]
*  Yeah. Balance. Right. OK. When that happens, now time and dynamics come in. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3518.1s)]
*  And people assume that excitation is very fast. Right. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3526.1s)]
*  And so if you take into consideration this little biological detail in the model that, you know, excitation is faster than inhibition, you still cannot fix it. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3531.1s)]
*  Because it's like an engineering system. You know, if you are from an engineering background, if you have very strong positive feedback, that's very fast. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3541.1s)]
*  And you have strong negative feedback that's slower. You can't really stabilize your device. Right. OK. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3549.1s)]
*  So for months I struggled, struggled. Didn't work. Right. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3555.1s)]
*  I tried all kinds of things. Short-term synaptic facilitation or depression. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3560.1s)]
*  You know, adaptation, things like that. Didn't work. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3566.1s)]
*  What do you mean for months? Because you could just tune the knobs pretty quickly. Right. And then run it and see. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3569.1s)]
*  That's the thing that I've talked to. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3575.1s)]
*  I've been fortunate to have collaborations with many experimentalists like Pat and Aakish. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3580.1s)]
*  Sometimes they are half jokingly to tell my collaborators that modeling takes time. Right. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3587.1s)]
*  It's not like really just tuning the knobs. I know. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3594.1s)]
*  Coming from an experimental background, I was always jealous of people who did models because it seems so fast. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3598.1s)]
*  But I guess it's not as fast as it seems. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3603.1s)]
*  Anyway, so I end up saying, oh, OK, maybe you don't have this problem. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3607.1s)]
*  If your excitation is slow, slower than inhibition. Right. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3612.1s)]
*  So if this slow gradual reverberation, then you have faster inhibition that keeps you in check all the time. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3617.1s)]
*  Quickly, efficiently. Right. Right. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3624.1s)]
*  And so that worked. And so, you know, that led to the idea that slow reverberation depends on the receptors. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3629.1s)]
*  Right. OK. Now. It turns out that it's exactly the slow reverberation that you need to explain physiological observations related to decision making. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3638.1s)]
*  So, you know, there's this famous experiment by Mike Shadrin, right? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3652.1s)]
*  Rodman and Shadrin, they found that when a animal is doing a very difficult decision task. Right. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3657.1s)]
*  There's this gradual ramping activity that is how neurons and neural population accumulate information. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3667.1s)]
*  I mean, in favor of different options. Right. Just to let just to let the less informed listeners know this is the famous what's sometimes called the dots task. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3679.1s)]
*  But it's a random percentage. So you can imagine looking at a screen. It is filled with some dots. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3690.1s)]
*  A proportion of those dots are moving in one direction and you can vary how easy it is to tell which direction they're moving by various ways to do it. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3699.1s)]
*  But just one way to do it is by how many of them are moving in that given direction. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3711.1s)]
*  And your job is to report which direction this somewhat random collection of dots is moving. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3715.1s)]
*  So this is the random motion coherence task. Sorry to interrupt. I just want to make sure that people are on board. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3723.1s)]
*  Exactly. So I guess the beauty of it is that you can parametrically change the task difficulty. Right. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3729.1s)]
*  So by changing the fraction of dots that move currently in one of the two directions. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3735.1s)]
*  So it goes from super easy to you can't tell it all and you can vary it at very minor steps. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3741.1s)]
*  And the thing that has been used to explain this in neural activity is this ramping of neural activity toward a threshold like that. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3749.1s)]
*  You're ramping your evidence, you're accumulating evidence toward a threshold. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3758.1s)]
*  And there is neural activity where that looks as if it is doing this sort of computation. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3762.1s)]
*  Exactly. So while you make the task more and more difficult with less and less coherence, you see that at the single cell level and also this day's with NeuronPixel at the population level, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3768.1s)]
*  this gradual ramping activity over time. Right. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3781.1s)]
*  By the way, apparently that's the same kind of algorithm that Alan Turing used to decipher the enigma code in the second wall. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3788.1s)]
*  And he didn't know about NMDA. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3800.1s)]
*  Well, it turns out that it's really frankly a shock that we just took the model designed for working memory from the shelf and applied to this dots perceptual decision making task. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3804.1s)]
*  You can pretty much explain everything observed in that experiment. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3819.1s)]
*  And that's because you have this duality. So you have this gradual ramping, you know, by slow reverberation, right, which is kind of slow transient dynamics. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3823.1s)]
*  Right. It's not a tractor or anything. But at the same time, you also have a winner take all right, leading to a categorical choice. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3835.1s)]
*  So I thought this is another example, I guess, how you could try to go across levels, because in the end, what explains the behavior is this emergent collective population dynamics, right, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3845.1s)]
*  described by dynamical system theory. But then you can go down, right, and ask, what's the cellular even receptor mechanism? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3859.1s)]
*  And on the other hand, you can really compare the model performance with monkeys, psychophysics, right. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3870.1s)]
*  So it's possible now to do this. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3878.1s)]
*  So is there a well, I want to ask you about bifurcation eventually. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3881.1s)]
*  All right. So there are inhibitory neurons in primary visual cortex, not as many as in prefrontal cortex. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3888.1s)]
*  There's high recurrence in primary visual cortex, maybe less so than in prefrontal cortex. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3896.1s)]
*  So what's qualitatively different about why wouldn't you have a working memory in primary visual cortex? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3902.1s)]
*  If you because you have the same sort of thing, but on a faster time scale, is there a cutoff point where it is released from the sensory activity? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3911.1s)]
*  Yeah, I guess you are asking about bifurcation. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3921.1s)]
*  I guess I am. Yeah. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3925.1s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3927.1s)]
*  So, by the way, I'm writing a piece for the transmitter. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3931.1s)]
*  You are. Okay. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3935.1s)]
*  The title is something like the missing half of the dynamical systems theory. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3938.1s)]
*  Oh, okay. And the missing half is bifurcation. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3943.1s)]
*  Right. So so this day's, you know, dynamic system theory is becoming really common and popular in neuroscience. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3946.1s)]
*  Yeah. And that's where you get that's where you came from. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3957.1s)]
*  And then it's what did it kind of go away for a while? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3960.1s)]
*  Like why is it and it has reemerged? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3963.1s)]
*  What is your viewpoint on the popularity of dynamical systems? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3965.1s)]
*  I guess it's really driven by data. Right. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3972.1s)]
*  So, again, when you have just one spike trend from a single cell at a time, you probably tend to focus on time series analysis. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3975.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3986.1s)]
*  And now, if you do recording from thousands of neurons at the same time, what do you do? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3987.1s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3992.1s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3993.1s)]
*  So, you know, one thing, you know, pioneered by people like actually G. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3994.1s)]
*  Loran with small species and then Krishna Chinoy and his collaborators. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=3999.1s)]
*  Now, you know, nowadays you see neuroscience journals full of papers on charge of race in the state space, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4010.1s)]
*  dimensionality reduction, subspace communication, manifold discovery. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4018.1s)]
*  Right. And so that's why. Right. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4023.1s)]
*  So they are really, really important. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4026.1s)]
*  Right. Again, it's still early days. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4030.1s)]
*  It's it's cool to see that. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4035.1s)]
*  I think it's early days. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4037.1s)]
*  I think it's kind of still early days because. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4039.1s)]
*  You know, you're going to see more data. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4044.1s)]
*  Right. And we're not done yet. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4047.1s)]
*  Right. Trying to understand manifold things like that. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4051.1s)]
*  But also because, you know, frankly, it's still kind of descriptive. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4055.1s)]
*  Right. It's a way to look at data. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4061.1s)]
*  Right. It's not mechanistic understanding. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4064.1s)]
*  Right. Well, there's some mechanistic understanding that sneaks in there. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4067.1s)]
*  When you're talking about dimensionality, for example, right. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4072.1s)]
*  If you have a system and you can't explain it with low dimension, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4077.1s)]
*  that means that there's that it has to remain in a high dimensional regime. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4081.1s)]
*  And in some sense, that's is that not mechanistic? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4086.1s)]
*  No, no, it's it's a really important, you know, knowledge. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4090.1s)]
*  Sure. It's a it's some understanding. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4096.1s)]
*  Right. I guess. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4099.1s)]
*  About the machine, I hear one example is that you mentioned as far as coding. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4102.1s)]
*  I think there's some evidence that sports coding is really desirable in sensory systems. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4107.1s)]
*  Right. Whereas again, in PFC, we together with the final foosie proposed that you actually want to have high, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4114.1s)]
*  you know, kind of high dimensional representations. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4124.1s)]
*  Right. That's, you know, functionally desirable with the use of what we call mixed selectivity. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4128.1s)]
*  Right. So, yeah, it's certainly some. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4137.1s)]
*  I'll just say mixed selectivity refers to the idea that like neurons can respond to lots of different signals or their activity is related to. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4141.1s)]
*  It's not a single function, essentially, like it can have activity related to lots of different functions. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4151.1s)]
*  So it has mixed select. It's selective to a mixed number of things. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4156.1s)]
*  Yeah. And for that, it's maybe that's really important for flexibility. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4161.1s)]
*  Right. In that circuit. And that requires high dimensionality of representations. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4167.1s)]
*  So I agree with you that, you know, certainly is very important. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4173.1s)]
*  But by mechanistic, I guess I mean circuit mechanism and across levels again. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4179.1s)]
*  Right. So, for example, when people say, you know, communication between areas are done by subspaces. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4186.1s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4193.1s)]
*  Totally we would like to know that's interesting. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4195.1s)]
*  That's a discovery. Right. By itself. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4199.1s)]
*  But maybe we want to understand how does that happen? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4202.1s)]
*  It's also just a slippery notion. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4205.1s)]
*  It's I've used the terminology myself enough that I feel comfortable with it, but I don't really know what I'm talking about when I say subspace. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4208.1s)]
*  We can maybe that's a very interesting topic. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4216.1s)]
*  I can do that. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4223.1s)]
*  Some other time graphs. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4225.1s)]
*  But again, it's, you know, for me, let me give you an example. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4227.1s)]
*  If you don't mind to go into a bit technical detail. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4233.1s)]
*  This again has to do with PFC dependent behavioral flexibility. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4237.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4242.1s)]
*  Brandon Milner, psychologist, you know, pioneered this paradigm as a test for normal prefrontal function called the Wisconsin cut sorting test. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4244.1s)]
*  Right. OK. So you are given a deck of cards and you're supposed to sort the costs in one of the three ways. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4256.1s)]
*  Right. So on each card, you have a certain number of colored shapes. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4264.1s)]
*  For example, this card has three green triangles. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4268.1s)]
*  Another card has, say, four red squares. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4272.1s)]
*  Right. OK. So you are sorting the cards either by color or number or shape. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4276.1s)]
*  Right. OK. So if the rule currently in play is color, it's what all the red cards in one pile, green or another pile, et cetera, without being told, the rule can change suddenly. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4283.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4299.1s)]
*  So impressive, you know, when the rule changes, you now have to do with the same cards. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4301.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4308.1s)]
*  Sorting in a different way. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4311.1s)]
*  Learning a new rule just by observation. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4313.1s)]
*  Just by observation and feedback. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4316.1s)]
*  So you're told that you did it right or wrong. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4318.1s)]
*  People with schizophrenia, for example, frontal lobe damage have real difficulty performing this task, especially switching the rule. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4321.1s)]
*  They tend to perseverate, you know, just keep following this old rule. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4331.1s)]
*  Even though they are given negative feedback. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4337.1s)]
*  Right. OK. So we build a model for something like this. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4340.1s)]
*  Which in principle requires internally maintain the rule across a long stretch of time. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4347.1s)]
*  Right. And then switch the rule while warranted. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4355.1s)]
*  OK. And what we found, just, you know, cutting to the conclusion of this modeling study, is that the representation, according to different rules, corresponds to different subspaces of neural population activity. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4359.1s)]
*  Right. OK. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4374.1s)]
*  You know, they are more or less orthogonal. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4377.1s)]
*  So if you follow the color rule, you are working, you're representing your processing information along this subspace. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4379.1s)]
*  And if you're following the shape rule, everything is in here. In this subspace. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4386.1s)]
*  Right. Now we designed a model to test the idea that this dendrite targeting inhibiting neurons are doing the gating. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4391.1s)]
*  Right. So this is a somatocytin neurons. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4400.1s)]
*  Right. So first we found this. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4404.1s)]
*  Right. Orthogonal subspaces over representation. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4407.1s)]
*  And now in the model you can do a lot of things that you like. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4410.1s)]
*  So in the model one way optogenetically manipulate, you know, inactivating. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4414.1s)]
*  Are you using air quotes with optogenetics? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4419.1s)]
*  Because it's model simulation. Right. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4422.1s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4424.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4426.1s)]
*  In the model. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4428.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4429.1s)]
*  And then the two subspaces collapse. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4430.1s)]
*  You know, and the performance is gone. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4432.1s)]
*  Performance is gone. Yeah. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4435.1s)]
*  So that's what I mean by how do you go from descriptive, you know, manifold description to second mechanism. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4437.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4444.1s)]
*  That's especially predictions. You can go to someone who is, you know, training mice to do this kind of task, for example, and really use real optogenetic. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4446.1s)]
*  No air quotes. Yeah. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4456.1s)]
*  Right. I hope that that illustrates what I mean by going between right. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4458.1s)]
*  This kind of description and the second mechanism. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4465.1s)]
*  Now, so back to the missing half. Yeah. Bifurcation. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4469.1s)]
*  Shall we? Yeah. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4474.1s)]
*  Right. So bifurcation may be familiar to many people, but not for everyone. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4478.1s)]
*  But it should be well known. In fact, I mean, one example everybody should know actually is a single neuron. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4484.1s)]
*  You know, think about how you learned about single neuron, you know, responses to a current injection. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4496.1s)]
*  Right. Described by Hodgkin-Huxley model. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4504.1s)]
*  Right. So if your input current is weak, but positive, your potential would go up a bit and reach a steady state. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4507.1s)]
*  And that's what you see also in the experiment. Right. So in the slice, you disconnect neurons. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4518.1s)]
*  You just watch one neuron at a time. Inject the current, you know, weak current gives you depolarization of the membrane. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4523.1s)]
*  Slight depolarization. Yeah. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4530.1s)]
*  So in the Hodgkin-Huxley model that correspond to a steady state. Right. A fixed point. So to speak. Right. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4532.1s)]
*  OK. And then you just gradually increase the intensity of your current injection. Right. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4540.1s)]
*  At some point, suddenly you don't get steady state anymore. Right. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4547.1s)]
*  Instead, you start to see action potential that repeats at some frequency. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4553.1s)]
*  Yeah. Injecting a steady, high enough current into the cell. Yeah. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4562.1s)]
*  OK. And that's no longer steady state. Right. And that's mathematically described as oscillation. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4567.1s)]
*  So this is a technique called limit cycle in the state space. Right. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4576.1s)]
*  It's a tractor in the sense that if you perturb it briefly, it will go back after perturbation to the same trajectory. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4581.1s)]
*  In the state space, it's a circle, you know, like this in the state space of the activity space of a single cell in this case. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4591.1s)]
*  Right. OK. So you did. Right. Really is just gradually increase something. In this case, a current. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4601.1s)]
*  Let's say linearly. You could do it linearly. Right. Yeah. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4611.1s)]
*  Yeah. And then that linear gradual quantitative change can lead to a qualitative change of behavior. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4615.1s)]
*  Right. So if you want to describe that rigorously, mathematically, it's called a bifurcation. OK. Right. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4626.1s)]
*  So, you know, I'm sure you heard about very knowledgeable about attractor networks. Right. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4636.1s)]
*  Applied to things like high direction cells, you know, place cells and for in our case, working memory. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4643.1s)]
*  Right. And they really can be described as emerging collective phenomena by changing something in a modest way. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4652.1s)]
*  Right. That's kind of the beauty of it. And that's something in this case could be the strength of recurrent excitation. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4663.1s)]
*  Right. Back to what we talked about earlier. Right. So all you did compared to V1 and PFC. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4671.1s)]
*  All you do is say you started with a generic canonical local circuit and just crank up the strands of recurrent excitation. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4677.1s)]
*  Right. And suddenly you start to see attractive states. So and that was, by the way, you know, the initial insights, you know, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4685.1s)]
*  You should first finish your sentence. No, no, I was going to ask you about the because before you said the word emergent, I was going to ask you about the relation between bifurcation and emergence. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4699.1s)]
*  If because it's a qualitative change, but you should finish your thought. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4708.1s)]
*  I want to acknowledge that this type of ideas were early on proposed, you know, in neuroscience by people like John Hopfield, which is, you know, of course, a well-known name, but also Daniel Amit, who did a lot of pioneering this attractive network paradigm. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4713.1s)]
*  And so that that I think is a one example where the idea of bifurcation is useful. Right. In neuroscience and not as well known as you should. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4739.1s)]
*  So do you think that that's missing from the current zeitgeist of the dynamical systems approach? You think it's not appreciated enough? How is it? How is bifurcation missing? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4750.1s)]
*  The other half. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4763.1s)]
*  Well, it's like, sorry, and I'm sorry to interrupt. But I, is it also how is it related to a phase change in state space? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4771.1s)]
*  It is related to phase change. Right. So in some sense, just at some general level, it's been like a phase transition in physics. Right. Like you have water, you'll increase the temperature to 100 degree. At that point, suddenly you see vaporization of H2O. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4781.1s)]
*  So it's similar to that. Okay. So how do you go from quantitative changes to sudden transition? Right. Okay. And that's at least I guess it should be more widely known in neuroscience. Right. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4802.1s)]
*  So we use this idea to understand the emergence of modularity. So I call that emergent because right. It's not something you build in. It's not even built in by, I would say, modules in the sense of graph theory. Okay. It's really emergent. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4819.1s)]
*  So it's through dynamics. So connecton, by the way, is really important and really exciting to see. Right. You know, all this new data base coming out. A beautiful example is, you know, connecton based model of the navigation system in Drosophila flies. Right. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4839.1s)]
*  But it's not enough to explain dynamics and function. Right. You know, one example I like to give in the book is to start with two neurons that connect to each other through mutual inhibition. Right. So what do you get? Right. You get, you know, say half center oscillator. Right. One is active. The other one is not active. And then they switch like this. And that's what we call the [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4862.1s)]
*  That may be a motif for central pattern generator. Right. But surprisingly, actually on some conditions about dynamics of synaptic interactions, they, this mutual inhibition actually can produce perfect synchronized oscillations in the system. Right. So you need dynamics to explain really the function. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4892.1s)]
*  And so, you know, I guess this bifurcation space, I think is in my mind, a way to say, well, the idea of bifurcation is useful if we want to understand the emergence of modularity, functional modularity. Right. In a large scale multirigional system. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4915.62s)]
*  Let me give you another example just to make it maybe really clear what we mean by functional modularity. We talk about decision making, like the random dots task. Right. Imagine that in a difficult example, in a difficult trial, the dots are really random. The evidence is very weak. Right. It is in favor of a, you know, leftward motion. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4943.46s)]
*  Barely in favor of leftward motion. Yeah. But your judgment is rightward motion. You say, I think it's rightward. Okay. Now what happens in your brain? Right. So you'd say the retina, right, encodes faithfully the physical stimulation and the retina should have more evidence in favor of leftward motion. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4971.86s)]
*  Maybe it's the case with V1. Maybe it's the case for MT, which is a specialized visual system for motion information process. Along that dorsal stream that you spoke of. Yeah. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=4997.06s)]
*  But then where suddenly you see the signal about subjective decision. Right. So there are certain areas that are really coding the physical stimulation. A, A, A. Right. And then there's some other areas. No, no, no. I think it's well, maybe it doesn't know A. It's B. Right. So that really is responsible for your subjective choice. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5012.58s)]
*  And so then eventually you get down to the motor neurons that are encoding that are in actuating the action. Right. And at some point in between those. Yeah. Exactly. So that's, you know, I would say that that's a question of functional modularity about subjective choice. Let's say, okay. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5041.06s)]
*  Let's define a functional modularity responsible for subjective choice. Okay. And then repeating what I said earlier, right. You have canonical circuit. You have all this dance interactions. You can go anywhere by one or two synapses. Right. So how do you get this emergence of modularity dedicated to subjective choice? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5061.54s)]
*  Right. So we think that this bifurcation in space could be a way to explain that. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5082.18s)]
*  There's a lot of multiple realizability, which is I'm trying to think about how that sits with the idea of bifurcation, which what you're saying is bifurcation is a super valuable thing in your system to be able to change. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5112.18s)]
*  To flip the ortho to flip the state space to change phases, essentially. Right. But her work shows that you can be in the same phase under lots of different regimes, even if you try to bifurcate it. So how do I how should we think about that? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5127.14s)]
*  No, that's interesting. Right. So it's a bit, I guess, more related to the question of redundancy. Right. So you want some function to be robust. Right. You know, in spite of changes of environment, changes of, you know, in the face of perturbations. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5148.74s)]
*  So actually, some people took Eve's findings in terms of multiple realizability, right, is the same function can be realized in different ways. That turns out to be a bit too simplistic. So her own work later showed that, in fact, like, you know, in the crabs or lobsters live in different environments. Right. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5174.26s)]
*  The temperature changes because of climate change. She actually had a paper on climate change, you know, and how that, you know, she's she actually she she's been on my podcast and she's passionate about that. And she observes it in the ocean. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5200.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. So so that's about the usefulness of redundancy. Right. Okay. You know, but but here, you know, if I put it in a kind of radical way in a way, but actually beef, it's there's a kernel of truth. You can think about bifurcations as a mathematical machinery to create [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5214.42s)]
*  novelty. Okay. Right. Functional novelty, right. Functional capabilities. So how do we really explain functional novelties? Of course, biological evolution is the ultimate answer. Right. But if you want to understand if you are given the same kind of stuff, so to speak, you know, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5239.46s)]
*  canonical circuits, how can you, you know, you know, really explain different functional capabilities in different parts of the brain in a way? Well, maybe all you need is differences, quantitative difference of some biology. Right. Same stuff. More is different. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5263.46s)]
*  Exactly. But different more. Right. Yes. But it has to be slightly different. Yeah. So that if that's true, right, if you can really if we can as a field, not just my lab, can push this idea to see if it really is an interesting idea. Right. Maybe we can have a general way to try to understand [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5285.46s)]
*  different kinds of, you know, functions. But let me just say one more thing about the robustness. Right. So the tricky thing, interesting about bifurcation in space is that it's actually not requiring fine tuning. So back just as a contrast, when I go back to single neuron example, right, you do change your current injection intensity in the brain. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5313.46s)]
*  In a careful way until you see this bifurcation. Right. So if you are on one side or the other, you miss it. So in that sense, you need fine tuning to really get to the transition point. Right. Right. So you see somehow the experimenter has to change something by hand. Right. Okay. Now, by version space is something that happens somewhere in the cortical tissue. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5343.46s)]
*  Is that necessarily true? Does it happen somewhere? Because it could be just distributed. Right. So you think it happens where like in this much of cortex or in this much of cortex? You know, okay, maybe it's a moot point. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5370.46s)]
*  No, no, it's not. It's something I think it's still not well understood. It's by the way, it's right now still a theoretical proposal. That's it. Right. We have to come down to specific predictions that should be testable experimentally. Right. And so, you know, if you think about the cortex as a two dimensional, you know, spatial system, right. What would the bifurcation do? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5386.46s)]
*  Right. I don't know. What's the contour of the transition? If that's what you're asking. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But the key thing is that somehow is localized because it has to be able to separate, say those areas that are engaged in working memory from those that are not. Right. Right. I guess alternatively, you'd say everywhere is everything's everywhere. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5413.46s)]
*  So, right. Working memory is everywhere. So I'm actually taking the, you know, opposing view. I say you do have a model module, right. For working memory. It's not everywhere. The same. Right. So if you take that view, at least right and see how far that compatible model is. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5432.46s)]
*  That can explain data. Right. Then there's some, you know, localization space that separates right this module that defines this module. Let me just say one more thing about because you asked about fine tuning. Yeah. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5451.46s)]
*  So that transition in space is very robust. When you change any parameter in your model, for example, I would say in the real brain system, maybe exactly where that occurred, that transition occurs, maybe shifted. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5465.46s)]
*  Okay. But the phenomena, this transition itself will not require any fine tuning or parameters. Right. And that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this goes to like how you define the parameters. Right. So that transition in space is very robust. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5480.46s)]
*  And what you're saying is the borders can kind of shift and you don't need to be so precise with whether it's 100 neurons or 101 neurons that are doing the task, doing the implementing the function. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5499.46s)]
*  Yeah. Or maybe even at the level of areas. I don't know. So the difference is that the level of the parameters is not defined. Right. So that's the difference. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5512.46s)]
*  Yeah. Or maybe even at the level of areas. I don't know. So depending on behavior demand, for example, you may want certain areas to be engaged in working memory in some other tasks you may not. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5525.46s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. So that boundary can shift according to behavior demand in principle. Right. And I'm doing pure speculation. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5538.46s)]
*  Yeah. But what you're saying is like by boundary, you mean different modules active together, like different subsets of areas active and co active. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5547.46s)]
*  Right. Exactly. Yeah. So I mean, that certainly is the case model. So in that sense, it's really we still wrap our mind around it because by fixing spaces is so new that I think we need to do more work to really understand it. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5560.46s)]
*  And we're talking to experimentalists trying to test some specific prediction from that. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5581.46s)]
*  So when you say it's early days in dynamical systems usage to explain brains, you mean because we're halfway there because we need to explain bifurcations and study them. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5589.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think bifurcation should be better known and maybe useful for answering certain questions. Right. So if we try to be specific, I'm actually trying really trying to go away from sweeping statements. Right. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5603.46s)]
*  But still, again, I already made a sweeping statement. Maybe this is one way to create a novel functionality. That's pretty sweeping. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5627.46s)]
*  Sweeping. Pretty sweeping. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5638.46s)]
*  Maybe it's worth also mentioning that why maybe we should stay away from bifurcations. Right. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5642.46s)]
*  And, you know, brain is so complicated, we should embrace different perspectives. Right. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5652.46s)]
*  And it's important for us to have many different approaches to understand how the brain works. One approach is control theory. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5660.46s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. If you really think about the brain as a machine, from the engineering perspective, like you do motor control, right, you really want to stay away from bifurcation. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5669.46s)]
*  Right. Because that always implies some instability. Right. Something that's unpredictable. Right. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5684.46s)]
*  So for certain things, we probably rightly try to stay away from instability and bifurcation. Right. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5692.46s)]
*  That's interesting. Like the cybernetic view and maybe cybernetics is coming back to but maybe for like your sensory and motor systems, you really want to be cybernetic. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5703.46s)]
*  You really want to be non bifurcational. But for everything else, cognitive, everything that we value as our high human cognitive abilities, maybe bifurcations then are actually beneficial. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5712.46s)]
*  Is that another sweeping statement that you're going to make? It's one way, certainly one way to try to understand. You know, that's interesting. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5724.46s)]
*  Yeah. Now let me make one more sweeping statement. Make four more. Come on. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5734.46s)]
*  One more sweeping statement is that how do you explain psychiatric disorders? Right. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5741.46s)]
*  So give me an example. Right. You know, in spite of enormous efforts in neuroscience and in clinical research. Right. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5747.46s)]
*  By the way, there's a new book that just came out by Nicole Rust. You should get her on your podcast. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5762.46s)]
*  So it'll be released next Wednesday, her episode that I recorded recently. Yeah, it is. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5769.46s)]
*  And her book is right about how basic research in neuroscience should really better meet the challenge of mental health. Right. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5776.46s)]
*  And embrace she embraces dynamical systems and complexity in the book. Yeah. Did she mention bifurcation? Did she? In the book? I don't believe she did. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5790.46s)]
*  Right. OK. So here's the thing. So so. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5800.46s)]
*  We can ask the question, right, if you really compare quote unquote normal subjects and people afflicted by some disorder like schizophrenia. Right. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5804.46s)]
*  Are you expecting quantitative differences in biological abnormalities? [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5818.46s)]
*  Or are you expecting qualitatively totally different kind of things? Doesn't it depend on the disorder? Because there are gradients and lots of disorders. Right. So maybe. Yeah. Right. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5824.46s)]
*  But at least it's a possibility. Right. We're in the realm of speculation here. Right. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5837.46s)]
*  There's there's a possibility that all you need is quantitative differences in biology. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5845.46s)]
*  To explain. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5852.46s)]
*  Qualitatively different behavior. Right. Right. So maybe there's not enough control. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5855.46s)]
*  Then people become impulsive. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5862.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5866.46s)]
*  Since I got so so that could be also potentially at least a useful thing to think about. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5867.46s)]
*  Right. When we try, you know, there's this lesson field called computational psychiatry. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5876.46s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And maybe that's one, you know, angle at least right to think about. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5881.46s)]
*  So that's another sweeping statement. And I like that you cautioned against the way Claude Shannon cautioned against using information theory to apply it to everything because back, you know, right after he invented information theory, everyone was applying it to everything. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5887.46s)]
*  He said, no, no, that this is a very specific thing. It shouldn't be applied to everything. And and you made a few sweeping statements about bifurcation. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5902.46s)]
*  But you also cautioned against it being the solution to everything, essentially. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5910.46s)]
*  Of course. Yeah, definitely. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5915.46s)]
*  Again, different perspectives, right. Different angles. But I think as part of the theory of dynamical systems. Right. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5920.46s)]
*  By the way, just to mention a detail, you will never get bifurcation if your systems is linear. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5928.46s)]
*  It has to be known in the dynamical system. So so this part of the theory of knowing that I know the system's perspective that I just feel like it's, you know, was mentioning that, you know, bifurcation needs to be more widely known and appreciated. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5935.46s)]
*  I was just at a conference and we were talking about human cognition and how we can scale brain data to better understand human specific cognition. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5953.46s)]
*  And I was asking someone, what do you think if you added more? What's beyond our current brain evolution? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5963.46s)]
*  If you if you expanded it further, what would that do? Right. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5971.46s)]
*  And I'm not asking you that what I'm asking you is, let's say, so you come from the dynamical systems background. You've seen it now flourishing and very embraced. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5976.46s)]
*  And let's say we add bifurcation and that explains a lot. What would be. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5986.46s)]
*  And I've been swimming in this, you know, manifold. Everything's a manifold. Everything's subspaces. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5991.46s)]
*  And and so now I'm thinking in the same way of like information theory and we were just talking about bifurcation, it seems like everything's a manifold and that's not right. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=5999.46s)]
*  You know, so like what would be beyond dynamical systems thinking? I guess we don't have it yet. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6008.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's a good question. I don't know the answer to it. I think we should be humble and be modest. Right. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6015.46s)]
*  So the truth is that we we don't know many things right about the brain, about PFC. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6022.46s)]
*  You know, PFC used to be called a riddle in psychology. I think it's still kind of mysterious. Right. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6032.46s)]
*  And. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6041.46s)]
*  By the way, I kind of tend to say think that the book that I wrote really covers very elemental cognitive building blocks. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6045.46s)]
*  Right. Those are the ones you know, even the list of 26 tasks I summarized in the last chapter. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6054.46s)]
*  Really other ones that could be studied with non human animals without language. Right. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6064.46s)]
*  In relatively simple setting. Right. So and what's really exciting is that most of them actually cannot be studied in mice even not just primates. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6072.46s)]
*  Right. That's great. But the question is how far we can go, you know, in that direction. Right. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6088.46s)]
*  So I I hope that at least what we learned are going to be useful to understand more and more complicated mental processes and even through the intelligence. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6096.46s)]
*  So what is through the intelligence Raven's Matrix, this matrix, for example. Right. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6114.46s)]
*  So but but I guess one thing that I'm becoming more and more interested in is its compositionality. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6122.46s)]
*  Right. That's the idea that you know, some primitives, some building blocks. Right. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6132.46s)]
*  And then you learn some rules, some grammar. Right. OK. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6138.46s)]
*  And then depend on what problem you try to solve. You flexibly combine different building blocks according to some syntax to create arbitrarily complicated sequence. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6143.46s)]
*  Right. What seems right. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6158.46s)]
*  I don't know if you know this, you know, it's interesting. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6161.46s)]
*  People who have frontal damage had difficulty to do to cook a meal because when you cook a meal, you have to be creative. Right. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6166.46s)]
*  You know, more compositional. Yeah, more you compose. Right. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6177.46s)]
*  You can plan and then you organize your task into subtasks. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6180.46s)]
*  And you have a goal in your mind all the time. Right. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6189.46s)]
*  You go through steps, you know, sub task and then go back to the task or the second sub task, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6193.46s)]
*  Very often things don't happen the way you planned. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6200.46s)]
*  Now you have to, you know, meet with, you know, new come up with new ideas to solve new problems until you reach the goal. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6203.46s)]
*  Right. And the people who are frontal damage couldn't do this kind of task. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6212.46s)]
*  Right. So if we could really understand how they're in does it, I think that that would be amazing. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6218.46s)]
*  How do you OK, so you mentioned mouse earlier and, you know, a lot of the tasks that you list in the last chapter, a lot of them can be assessed using a mouse model. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6227.46s)]
*  I'm currently working with mouse, but I come from a nonhuman primate background. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6236.46s)]
*  And the reason why I was in a nonhuman primate lab is because I wanted to study something as close as I could to subjective experience or consciousness. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6241.46s)]
*  And then I realized, well, it's a fool's errand, basically. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6251.46s)]
*  But that's what my Ph.D. is. And but what do you think about. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6254.46s)]
*  So mice have become popular, get more popular again in terms of like, oh, mice can do these cognitive tasks. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6259.46s)]
*  But how far do you think we can go using rodents in general to study and understand and explain these higher cognitive functions that we want to know about? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6266.46s)]
*  Is decision making in a mouse the same bifurcation as it is in a human brain, for example? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6278.46s)]
*  You know, or what do you what's your viewpoint on the using mice for these cognitive studies? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6284.46s)]
*  See, I try to avoid, you know, subjective mind kind of question because you're bright and I'm not. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6293.46s)]
*  Yeah, let me actually let me actually actually say something about it. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6300.46s)]
*  So, you know, I don't expect the mice to cook a meal for us. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6304.46s)]
*  So that's another question. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6309.46s)]
*  But I do think that a certain mental subjective, you know, experience can be studied with mice. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6312.46s)]
*  You ask about decision making. So the simplest decision making is actually detection. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6326.46s)]
*  Right. So if you show visual stimulus and all you need to do is to say, I see it or I don't see. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6332.46s)]
*  But the trick is that you change the contrast of your stimulus. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6340.46s)]
*  Right. So this is this psychometric function, right. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6344.46s)]
*  As a function of the contrast, when the contrast is low, you don't see it. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6347.46s)]
*  When the contrast is high, it's very easy to see. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6351.46s)]
*  And it's nonlinear. So it's kind of like a sigmoid curve. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6354.46s)]
*  Right. So if you are right at the decision threshold with the same physical stimulation, the same photos, photos onto your retina, sometimes you see it. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6358.46s)]
*  Sometimes you don't see it. Right. Right. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6370.46s)]
*  OK. Now that's subjective. I guess, you know, awareness of stimulus. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6372.46s)]
*  Right. And people do this kind of experiment. You had Peter Robsimer on your show. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6380.46s)]
*  He did a very interesting monkey experiment using exactly that paradigm. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6386.46s)]
*  And sometimes they don't show the stimulus. Right. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6391.46s)]
*  And most of the time the animal says, I don't see it. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6396.46s)]
*  But occasionally the animal says, I see it. That's false alarm. Right. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6399.46s)]
*  So what they found is that, you know, early sensory neurons essentially reflect physical stimulation. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6405.46s)]
*  Right. Hit trial, miss trial, more or less the same response. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6414.46s)]
*  No response when you don't show the stimulus. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6419.46s)]
*  But PFC seems to reflect subjective awareness. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6422.46s)]
*  Right. And you see the kind of activity level, you know, in the hit trials or in the false alarm. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6428.46s)]
*  Right. So, you know, if you agree that's, you know, a simple way to look at subjective awareness, I think that can be done with mice. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6438.46s)]
*  Yeah. But their prefrontal cortex and the great, for example, like the gradient of inhibitory neurons from visual cortex up toward their frontal cortex is different. Right. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6450.46s)]
*  It's like the bifurcations are going to be all different, even though it's made of the same stuff. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6463.46s)]
*  That's the worry. Right. That we're. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6468.46s)]
*  Well, it could be different, right. In details. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6472.46s)]
*  But again, you know, there should be a module of areas somehow responsible for subjective choice. Right. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6476.46s)]
*  So you think if artificial intelligence has a prefrontal cortex, it'll be subjective. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6487.46s)]
*  This is what we'll end on. I know, you know, I know you're hesitant to talk on this. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6495.46s)]
*  But before before we do that, is there is there other anything else that I haven't asked you that you want to share? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6499.46s)]
*  No, I think we covered credit. Right. Yeah. OK. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6508.46s)]
*  Perhaps we'll end on this if you're willing. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6511.46s)]
*  I well, I frankly, I have not thought about, you know, the question of awareness in machines. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6516.46s)]
*  Yeah. That was kind of a joke. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6523.46s)]
*  But but but you have you wrote to me, AI needs a prefrontal cortex. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6524.46s)]
*  So why is why would that be right? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6527.46s)]
*  So that's more about flexibility and fluid intelligence. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6530.46s)]
*  OK, so, for example, machines are not so great at multitasking. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6534.46s)]
*  Right. So this day is if you try to translate our robot to do more than one task or, you know, software, [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6540.46s)]
*  usually what you do is to just add, you know, different cost functions. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6548.46s)]
*  You add them up right for different tasks, one for each. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6553.46s)]
*  That doesn't work. Right. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6557.46s)]
*  So PFC is actually crucial for multitasking. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6559.46s)]
*  Right. If we learn about how PFC does it, perhaps, you know, there's some new technology out there. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6566.46s)]
*  If we learn about how PFC does it, perhaps, you know, there's some new insights that we can translate through computational modeling to be, you know, smart machines capable of doing multiple things. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6573.46s)]
*  And I would argue actually thinking in a way, you know, intelligence solving new problems in a way, it's a bit similar to, you know, complicated sequences of events, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6587.46s)]
*  except that they're not motor acts. They are internal. Right. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6602.46s)]
*  You know, events in our mind. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6607.46s)]
*  So if we really understand how this kind of flexible, you know, generation of sequences with recursiveness, with compositionality, I think we can go a long way. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6610.46s)]
*  You think about smart machines. Okay, Xiao Xing. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6628.46s)]
*  It is a joyous and also deep historical and modern view and recounting and perspective on theoretical neuroscience and it's like an excellent resource. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6633.46s)]
*  It has it all. Like it's it reminds me how long I've been in this field and how little I still know. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6647.46s)]
*  For one thing, but modest. Yeah. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6654.46s)]
*  Okay. So anyway, great to see you again. Thank you for coming on. And it's been a pleasure having you on. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8Mvqj1TnI&t=6657.46s)]
