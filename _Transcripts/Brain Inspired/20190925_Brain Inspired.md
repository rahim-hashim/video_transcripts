# BI 048 Liz Spelke: What Makes Us Special?
**Brain Inspired:** [September 25, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TkAVf8SHJI)
*  I felt completely bewildered and overwhelmed by how much adults know and how hard it is
*  and how little access we have to our own minds and the workings of our own minds.
*  And therefore, how hard it was to figure out of all the different things we know and of
*  all the things we can do, what's actually fundamental and what's kind of been built
*  on top of that.
*  And so for me, an infant is a much simpler system.
*  I think we all know almost nothing about the world.
*  If I have a religion, my religion is science.
*  I believe in science.
*  I think if we look back over human history, we have seen more progress in science than
*  in any other domain of human culture.
*  If you compare what we know now to what we knew 100 years ago or a thousand years ago
*  or three thousand years ago, I mean, the differences in the domain of science are immense.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  So these all seem to me like hard problems, but solvable problems through the interdisciplinary
*  enterprise that you have here.
*  So thanks for listening.
*  That is the sound of people clapping for Liz Spelke.
*  At the end of her keynote talk, which opened the Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Conference
*  in Berlin, which I just got back from, the goal of the CCN conference is to bring together
*  ideas from the study of natural and or artificial intelligence to characterize the neural computations
*  that underlie our complex behaviors.
*  You've heard me on the show interview a bunch of the speakers from that conference.
*  So it was really fun to go and connect with them in person as well.
*  The conference was a good time.
*  It is a strong and budding community.
*  Being there, I really got the sense of the challenges that there are for the different
*  disciplines that study natural and artificial intelligence to come together.
*  And you can sense the desire to continue to come together and work across disciplines
*  and figure all this stuff out.
*  I won't give an overview of the conference here, but I will have plenty more to say about
*  it in the coming weeks as I have on some of the other folks who are there and get their
*  impressions as well.
*  And I want to say thank you.
*  Many of you approached me to say hi while we were there, and that was super fun to meet
*  many of you in person.
*  So thanks for the kind words, the encouragement.
*  I even got some critical feedback, which was awesome.
*  So that's much appreciated, and I look forward to seeing you in the future.
*  There were some of you that I missed that I had intended to come say thank you to for
*  supporting the show or for being on the show.
*  So I will correct that next time.
*  And man, what a strange experience on the last night of the conference for me to hear
*  music from my show playing in the background during the last little mixer party among the
*  other music.
*  So I was among the crowd and I started kind of feeling this vague familiarity rise up
*  in my thoughts and kind of had this feeling like, oh, it sounds like a good song.
*  And only then did I come to realize it was the song from my show and someone had put
*  it into the musical mix.
*  So whoever you are that was thoughtful made me literally tingle with delight, and it's
*  making me smile now, as maybe you can hear.
*  Okay, today's show.
*  What cognitive tools do we start off with in life that serve as the foundation and or
*  the scaffolding for all of our other cognitive functions?
*  If we knew that and we knew how to build it, would we be able, like Alan Turing proposed,
*  to build child-level AI that would itself progress into more sophisticated adult-level
*  AI?
*  What makes us humans so special cognitively?
*  Or at least special enough to believe that we're pretty damn special?
*  Why do my children not love me as much as they love their mom?
*  Where are my children?
*  Liz Spelke knows the answer to some of those questions.
*  Liz is a professor at Harvard who studies what makes us uniquely human, and she does
*  that by studying the cognition of young developing humans, usually infants.
*  So Liz has been successful for a long time with numerous awards, trophies, medals, standing
*  ovations.
*  I'm sure she's had lots of personalized cakes made in her honor.
*  But recently, those of us wanting to understand both natural and artificial intelligence have
*  taken a keen interest in her work.
*  We talk about her experience of the recent rise in interest in her work from the AI community
*  in her work on cognitive development.
*  We discuss some of the core cognitive abilities of infants, what we all enter the world with,
*  and the limits to those abilities at that age and why those limits could help us better
*  understand intelligence.
*  And finally, before getting into a few general topics, we talk about why she thinks that
*  language is perhaps the key thing that makes us as humans special.
*  Although, as Liz knows, this is not a new idea, that language is the key thing, we do
*  have new means of understanding why and how language might be the key.
*  We did get cut off multiple times while I was interviewing her because of Harvard's
*  apparently unreliable internet, but hopefully I pieced it together well enough that you
*  either can't tell or it's not too distracting.
*  Show notes are at braininspired.co.
*  slash podcast slash 48, where you can also learn how to support the show through Patreon.
*  Thank you to my recent Patreon supporters, Matt, Carson, Dean, Anand and Ben.
*  I've mentioned on the show that I'm creating some content that will eventually be available
*  to purchase.
*  If you're a supporter of the show, you will have access to and be a part of that creation
*  process.
*  Okay, wishing you all a full recovery from jet lag if you traveled like I did to the
*  conference and otherwise wishing you success and fortune in your endeavors.
*  I hope you're doing well out there.
*  Okay, here's my conversation with Liz Spelke.
*  Liz Spelke, Baby Wrangler extraordinaire.
*  Thank you for bringing your adult talents to the show today.
*  And welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  Liz, how often do you get questions from parents about their own kids and what to do?
*  As infrequently as possible.
*  From all the years that I've studied infants, I've learned really nothing that parents want
*  to know about how to make their kids happy, how to get them to go to sleep at night, any
*  of that.
*  I'm terribly successful at that as a mother or as a grandmother, but basically all I've
*  learned about it has come from that experience, not from what I do with babies in the lab.
*  All right, I'm crossing off the rest of my questions here then.
*  All right, so hey, you're giving a keynote address at Cognitive Computational Neuroscience
*  Conference in three, two days, three days.
*  Two days.
*  I fly to Berlin tomorrow.
*  So it's yeah, it's two or three days, something like that.
*  I do too.
*  I'll be in the audience actually.
*  Oh great.
*  And this won't air until after that happens.
*  So we'll see how it goes here.
*  So that's the Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Conference and it's all about bringing together
*  AI people with cognitive science and neuroscience people.
*  And you've given lectures at MIT's Brains, Minds, and Machine course, which are online.
*  They're great resources for people.
*  And of course, I'll link to those things.
*  I'm curious if the interest in your work from the AI community, from the AI side, has increased
*  in the past few years.
*  I had hoped that this would be the case like 40 years ago.
*  On my first sabbatical, I guess it's not quite 40 years ago, but in 1982, I took my first
*  sabbatical after grad school and four years of teaching and went to MIT to the newly founded
*  Center for Cognitive Science.
*  I was all excited to be interacting with people in computer science over how can we model
*  what we see babies doing in the experiments that we're doing.
*  And I think it was just too early at that point.
*  But there was a lot of interest in modeling adult cognition, which was in vogue for a
*  while and then of course went through a series of changing seasons.
*  There was also interest in modeling simpler animals like flies.
*  I didn't get a lot of traction at that point when I talked about infants to that community.
*  So it's really only quite recently that I think maybe both the cognitive sciences have
*  gotten to a point in understanding human development and also computer science has gotten to the
*  point in building intelligent machines where we can start to have a productive conversation.
*  So I'm excited that that interest is starting now.
*  Oh yeah, because it seems to be running rampant right now.
*  You're getting a lot of knocks on your door.
*  So so the title of your talk, you're the first person that I've interviewed that's
*  giving a keynote that actually we can actually talk about a little bit more about what you're
*  going to be talking about because everyone else is like, oh, it's so early.
*  I have no idea. The title of your talk is from our conversation is not exactly happening
*  early and I'm sorry about that.
*  No, but I'm so glad it is.
*  So the title of your talk is from core concepts to new systems of knowledge.
*  And I'm just going to go out on a limb and guess that you're going to be talking about
*  centenarians or midlife crises or what are you going to be talking about?
*  No, I'm going to be talking about infants.
*  And part of my talk is going to be about the part of my talk that I'll give with more
*  confidence is going to be about what the interdisciplinary field of developmental cognitive
*  science has learned about what infants know at the beginning about the world that they're
*  then thrust into and able to to learn about.
*  But then the question that I'm really most fascinated by is the question, where does
*  development go from there and how do infants begin to figure out what particular world
*  they've been born into and what the people around them are doing and what objects are
*  doing and how you can move from one place to another in this world and so forth, how
*  you develop basic common sense over the first five years of life or so before you get in
*  the business of going to school and getting formally instructed.
*  Kids are doing a lot of learning.
*  Some of it is the kind of learning that we see in animals as well, depending on very
*  basic general mechanisms that evolved long before we did.
*  But some of it, I think, are uniquely human learning processes.
*  And those, I think, are the processes that yield whole new systems of knowledge, not
*  just new facts about the world or new individual concepts one by one, but whole new
*  systems like mathematics or science.
*  And and some of these, like the system of natural numbers kids come to before they get
*  to school, they're constructing this new knowledge on their own.
*  And I think their course of development is going in a very different direction from what
*  we see in other animals in that respect.
*  So I'm very interested in that.
*  I don't know how kids do that, but I think we're at a point where that's a tractable
*  question. If you can bring together the kinds of people that CCN is bringing together,
*  people working in multiple disciplines on the question, what is intelligence and how
*  do you create it in a machine?
*  How do we understand it in our own minds?
*  And I think one one way, certainly not the only way of going at that, is to ask, how
*  do we understand the mind of a very young child who's taking the first steps in
*  deploying this human intelligence that we have?
*  I mean, just going through my little my little scientific education,
*  one of the things that really scared me was development.
*  I thought, God, it's such a mess.
*  How are we going to figure it? We can't even figure out adult cognition, for instance.
*  How are we going to figure out development?
*  So it's so glad you got it backwards.
*  Oh, well, we'll talk about more and more about that.
*  So so, yeah, I know. I mean, I think we have it exactly backwards.
*  And when I started graduate school, I felt just the opposite.
*  So the field I was going into as a grad student was cognitive psychology, not
*  developmental. And I felt completely bewildered and overwhelmed by how much
*  adults know and how hard it is and how little access we have to our own minds
*  and the workings of our own minds and therefore how hard it was to figure out of
*  all the different things we know and of all the things we can do, what's actually
*  fundamental and what's kind of been built on top of that.
*  And so for me, an infant is a much simpler system.
*  Infants know almost nothing about the world.
*  So way more tractable problem than trying to understand you and me.
*  Or, yeah.
*  I mean, speaking of trying to understand what's going on in minds, well, you know,
*  it's a little easier to ask adults questions than it is to ask infants questions.
*  So we'll get to how you actually probe that in just a bit here.
*  But but what do you think we need more of or better of to to to start probing
*  these questions that you're asking? Do you think we need better experiments, better
*  models, more data, better theory, et cetera?
*  Yes, and yes, and yes, yes.
*  Yeah, you have to choose one.
*  I mean, I think we need no, no, no, I think we need I think we need more of all of this.
*  I mean, so one thing that I think research over the last 40 years has shown is that we
*  can we can ask babies questions and get answers from them.
*  Sometimes their answers are really surprising.
*  And that's, I think, when they've been most useful and moved research in new
*  directions, moved us to ask new questions and look at our own abilities and
*  infants abilities in new ways.
*  So I think, yes, we can do that.
*  But I think that the kind of behavioral research that I do is much better at
*  figuring out what infants know than at figuring out how they know what what they
*  know or why they know what they know.
*  And it's the how and the why questions that we really want to answer.
*  And for that, I think we need a broader interdisciplinary effort.
*  We need to understand how brains grow and learn.
*  We need to understand cognition in nonhuman animals, because for all that we
*  take our learning in new, uniquely human directions, nevertheless, it's based on
*  basic systems that we share with other animals.
*  And I think we need to understand we need to work with computational models to
*  understand better what kinds of functions these brains and minds are performing.
*  That's allowing learning to happen.
*  Well, is there anything in particular that you want to take away from from being
*  at this conference in a couple of days?
*  Yeah.
*  So what I think I get most out of conferences is new ways to think about
*  questions that I don't know how to answer yet.
*  So one thing that I'm pretty convinced is true is that all animals, including us,
*  come into the world equipped with cognitive resources that bring us genuine
*  knowledge about the world in advance of our experience with the things we have
*  knowledge of. So before a baby ever encounters an object, a baby understands
*  basic properties of how objects behave, how they move around, how they interact
*  with each other before they ever can pick themselves up and navigate through an
*  environment. They have a basic ability to represent the geometrical structure of
*  space and how one path connects to another and so forth.
*  And similarly, for understanding of other people as creatures who are like themselves,
*  who can communicate with them and share experiences or understanding animals and
*  people as agents who can act on the world and cause changes.
*  These are basic conceptions that are there and ready to support children's learning
*  at the very beginning of life.
*  But how do they get there and what's going on over the course of fetal development?
*  So, yeah, so I'm actually really this is this is out there, I know, but I'm actually
*  excited to engage with people who study things like imagination, sometimes called
*  replay or preplay or things like that, you know, in in the brain and in the mind and
*  in the possibility that maybe some relatively simple programs for generating
*  experiences that simulate the world might be part of our genetic endowment.
*  You know, the ability to grow those might be part of our genetic endowment and
*  actually prepare the brain for the kinds of basic experiences that our early
*  learning is going to build on.
*  Oh, great. I'm looking forward to your talk.
*  And are there going to be questions and answers or it's there?
*  There won't be because it's a keynote, huh?
*  I have no idea how this works. This is my first CCN meeting.
*  Yeah, well, it's only it's only above infancy, actually.
*  It's only been this is the third year, I believe.
*  So, yeah, well, here's what I'm wanting.
*  I want you to give me a question to I want you to plant a question and I'll ask it at
*  the end and then you can look even smarter than you are.
*  What's the what questions should I ask you at the end?
*  What are you wanting someone to ask you?
*  I don't know. We'll figure it out as we go along.
*  All right, we'll see. I'll I'll try to come up with a good one then.
*  OK, so so there's this classic argument for studying the brain to inform artificial
*  intelligence. And it goes like this, that it's very simple.
*  The brain is the only example that we have of general A.I.
*  so it makes sense to study it.
*  So I have a pitch for you.
*  And I don't know if you've already pitched it this way.
*  But what do you think of this advertisement for cognitive development?
*  A good reason to study early developing cognition is that it is the only example
*  that evolution has of a solution that evolution has come up with to build brains,
*  which are the only example of general intelligence that we have.
*  What do you think?
*  Yeah, no, I think that's right.
*  I mean, I think that neuroscience and cognitive science are studying
*  the same natural phenomenon in complementary ways.
*  And each field is enriched by the other.
*  Cognitive science, I think, is particularly useful for trying to figure out
*  what the brain is doing, what problems it's trying to solve, which simply looking
*  at the brain in itself, you don't get a clear sense of.
*  But I think that are just personally the advances that have been made
*  in neuroscience in fields like navigation and vision
*  have been transformative for me in thinking in thinking about cognitive development,
*  especially when we see infants
*  when we study cognitive capacities in infants and discover that those we have
*  every reason to believe that those capacities are shared by other animals.
*  And therefore, research using all the panoply of methods from neuroscience
*  applied to other animals, as well as the panoply of methods
*  like controlled rearing studies that are that that at least traditionally
*  were common to neuroscience and the behavioral sciences
*  are available to study the development of these these abilities.
*  That's been an extremely powerful tool.
*  So, yes, no, I think all of these fields belong together.
*  They kind of naturally go together.
*  Yeah. So, yeah, there should be lots of occasions
*  like CCN where people in these different fields get together.
*  One of the reasons I think why people have been interested
*  recently in your work is because, like you said, we've come to the point
*  where the technology has become better.
*  We've been able to build bigger and better models.
*  We have more data.
*  But the idea of sort of modeling, developing
*  humans for AI is an old one.
*  So Alan Turing in his 1950 paper proposed building child level
*  AI that with the goal of it developing itself into an adult level intelligence.
*  And you've pointed out that Herman von Helmholtz
*  appreciated the need to do experiments with infants to understand
*  how we do things like perceive 3D objects and color.
*  And he also appreciated the difficulty in performing.
*  Yeah. He actually thought it was kind of impossible to perform
*  those experiments on infants.
*  But do you think that it's the right that building toddler level
*  AI, you think that's the right goal?
*  Is that the right way forward?
*  Forward for who? For AI, for AI, science, for for for building intelligence?
*  I don't have an opinion on that, actually.
*  I well, I do have an opinion.
*  My opinion is there is no one right way forward that I don't.
*  My my reading of the field is it has not gotten to a point
*  where it has converged on a single right way forward.
*  I do think there's a very good reason for some people to be attempting
*  to build machines that start out knowing what infants know and that learn
*  as best we can determine in the ways that infants learn,
*  which is the argument that you gave that this is the one existence
*  proof we have that it's possible for an entity to develop human level
*  general intelligence.
*  Infants do this, right?
*  So I think it's a very it's going to be a good approach.
*  Whether in the end it'll turn out that, you know, the ultimate goal
*  of artificial general intelligence has been met through that path
*  or through other paths, I wouldn't presume to to make a prediction on that.
*  I think if I were investing in AI, I'd probably want to see a hundred
*  flowers bloom and people trying all different sorts of ways of of getting there.
*  I do think it's a very good thing to be trying.
*  What do you think that cognitive development can contribute to AI?
*  Well, I think that two things.
*  One is.
*  I think it's undeniable that everything that that an animal
*  or a human of any age learns builds on what they already understand.
*  And we shouldn't simply be trying to build machines by taking something
*  that has no internal structure.
*  Well, it's got an architecture, but it doesn't have any basic
*  understanding of the world at all.
*  And expect that by simply giving it sensory experiences,
*  it's going to gain that understanding.
*  I think that's just going to turn out to be be true.
*  Whether the best kinds of things to give it are what Darwinian evolution
*  has has given to infants is another question.
*  But there's going to be initial structure there.
*  And I think that studies in cognitive development can help people to think about
*  what sorts of starting points should we have for a system that we want to be able
*  to go out in the world, interact with objects, look at things and learn.
*  So I think that's that's going to be really important.
*  A second thing is, although we don't understand,
*  I mean, there's a lot of debate currently in the field about how children learn
*  and what sets human children's learning apart from the learning of other animals.
*  There's a lot of debate about that.
*  I think we're at a point in the field where there are some clear hypotheses
*  that have a chance of being right and they're testable, testable,
*  especially if you can bring to bear work that looks at brains and work that looks at
*  behavior and and work that looks at computations and tries to play with how these
*  how these punitive processes play out in machines.
*  I think we're at a point where these questions are testable,
*  which makes this a really exciting time, I think, for people in any of these disciplines
*  to be looking at human cognitive development and trying to figure it out.
*  Yeah. So despite our current president of the United States,
*  there are differences between babies and adults.
*  And so what are some of the differences between infants and adults that
*  that you might see? I mean, there are obvious differences,
*  but what are some that you might see as key to understanding how to build
*  intelligent adults and or machines?
*  Yeah. So first of all, I don't want to lump all ages of infancy together.
*  I mean, to me, the fundamental distinction is not between infants and adults.
*  It's between what we start with and where we go from there.
*  The processes that take us from our beginnings to the kind of general
*  common sense intelligence that five year old children show.
*  To me, that's kind of the pinnacle.
*  After that, you know, you go to school, you're instructed a little more.
*  Straightforward ruins. Yeah, it's a little more.
*  It's not quite it doesn't have that same self initiated
*  spark that I see there early on. Yeah.
*  So I think the fundamental difference that and it's very different
*  from what I thought we were going to see when I first started studying infants.
*  I wanted to understand what's unique about human minds.
*  And I thought that the youngest infants would be the ones who would tell us that
*  because they would be the simplest cognitive system
*  that was on this path that was going to be so different from every other animal.
*  And to me, it was a huge puzzle how we could be so different.
*  How could we be the only creatures on the planet who remake the world,
*  who imagine things that don't exist and then invent them, you know,
*  who change the world so radically when when you look at our brains,
*  when you look at our perceptual systems, our action systems,
*  all of our basic abilities, we look so similar to other animals,
*  so similar that most of what we know about ourselves
*  comes from research on other animals. Right.
*  What sets us on this different path?
*  And I thought that studying young infants would answer that question.
*  And as best as I can determine, I was 100 percent wrong about that,
*  that what we find when we study young infants are these fascinating
*  and wonderful abilities to represent objects that aren't there
*  and track them over time and anticipate how things will interact with each other
*  to represent number and quantitative relationships between different
*  sets of things, to represent the spatial layout and figure out
*  how it would appear from different directions and how you could get
*  from one place to another.
*  We see all these wonderful abilities.
*  But when we turn to other animals, we see the same abilities in them.
*  And I think it's only at about the end of the first year of life
*  that I see really convincing evidence that babies are moving in a direction
*  that's going to carry us away from other animals.
*  And the point at which I see that or think I'm seeing that anyway,
*  I'm I my hunch is that that's where the change is happening,
*  is that that seems to be the point at which children have learned enough
*  of their native language that they're starting to get in the business
*  of learning from other people by discerning other people's thoughts
*  from what other people say.
*  So language learning begins before birth, before kids are even born.
*  They're hearing speech sounds in the womb.
*  They come out into the world and they can distinguish speech
*  in their own from someone who's speaking their language
*  versus a different language.
*  So language learning is a continuous process.
*  But I think there's a point at about a year of age
*  where kids have learned enough of the sounds of their language
*  and enough of the relationships between individual strings of sounds.
*  Maybe we should be thinking of them as words at that point,
*  maybe something prior to full blown words.
*  But strings of sounds connecting to things in the world,
*  predicting what's good, what they're going to see from what other people say
*  and so forth.
*  That's all happening continuously over the first year.
*  But I think around the end of the first year, kids have worked out
*  enough of their language that they can understand full sentences
*  as conveying thoughts.
*  And at that point, they can get in the business of learning from other people.
*  And really, despite the fact that we see young children
*  exploring autonomously, curious about the world,
*  trying to find things out on their own, children's learning,
*  I think, is also really deeply social.
*  And a lot of what they're learning about the world, they're learning from people around them,
*  not because the people are explicitly teaching them,
*  but because from the things that people just naturally say,
*  with no pedagogical motive in mind, from the things that people say,
*  people convey an enormous amount of information about the world
*  and about their beliefs about the world and about abstract stuff
*  that's not in the here and now.
*  And once you understand enough language that you can
*  get a thought from someone else about something that's not happening
*  immediately before you right now, I think that's that's a step that
*  that no other animal is able to take and that an infant can't take
*  until their language learning has progressed to that point.
*  So so I so I do see a qualitative change there
*  that distinguishes the younger infants from the rest of us.
*  Yeah. Well, so we'll definitely we're going to come back to language
*  as a key difference in in what sets humans apart and makes us unique.
*  So before we get there, a couple of things.
*  One, how do you experiment with infants?
*  So so there's like one standard paradigm.
*  Right. Am I right?
*  Yes, no, yes, no.
*  There's one that you have used most frequently, which is preferential looking.
*  And so do you want to just describe what that is really quickly?
*  Sure. First of all, a disclaimer.
*  I have never invented a single paradigm for studying infants.
*  So the the method was actually developed by people working in vision
*  and psychophysics, and it was used to
*  power beautiful work by people like Richard held at MIT
*  charting the development of stereopsis in infants
*  from the simple fact that if you put goggles on them
*  and showed them two fields of stripes, one of which
*  presented disparities such that it's like a 3D movie.
*  You're seeing those stripes arranged in depth and the other of which presented
*  flat stripes and showing that babies would look reliably longer
*  at the side that had the depth variation
*  and then doing these gorgeous psychophysical experiments to show that
*  it wasn't that they were attracted by double images.
*  It was only under the conditions in which images are arranged
*  such that for an adult observer, you see stereoscopic depth
*  only under those conditions. Did you see it in the infants? Right.
*  So you could run the whole field of psychophysics on an infant
*  using this simple measure of looking time.
*  And of course, the nice thing about looking time is that babies
*  can't do much early on.
*  So if you really want to do developmental studies like held did
*  that go all the way from a one month old infant up to the point
*  where stereopsis is fully functional, you need a measure that that is
*  that's accessible to infants at all of all those different ages.
*  So that's that's the real virtue, I think, of preferential looking measures.
*  But what I always tried to do in my own research was actually come at
*  the same problem with different measures.
*  So when we were studying what I thought at the time,
*  I think it was at the time was object perception, not what babies know about
*  objects, but just if they look out at an array of objects,
*  can they tell where one thing ends and the next thing begins or things like that?
*  We tried to engage infants with a variety of different measures,
*  like reaching for objects.
*  If you want to see that they see a boundary between two things,
*  see whether they reach for you, present them with an array of two objects and see
*  will they reach for that array as if as if it were a single hole
*  or will they reach for each part of it separately?
*  And those measures converged with looking time measures
*  that we're trying to get at the same ability.
*  So I think the goal all along has not been to be wedded to a single
*  measure, but to be wedded to a set of questions and to follow them wherever they
*  they lead. And looking time has been very useful for that.
*  Liz, do you think that working with infants has helped you
*  is going to help you live longer and happier?
*  It certainly made me happy.
*  Will I live longer? I don't know.
*  What's been really fascinating about working with kids is that every step
*  of the way, my intuitions about what they would and wouldn't understand,
*  how they would and wouldn't react to some situation have been upended.
*  It's been one surprise after another. And that makes it really fun.
*  It's kind of like being in a mystery story that's unfolding.
*  You're walking through and living through and it's unfolding as you go.
*  So, yeah, it's been great.
*  You talking about the preferential looking also just made me think,
*  you know, what a really cool project would be is to have some virtual reality
*  goggle system where you could key up any visual experiment or,
*  you know, experiments that have been done in the past and you get to actually
*  experience the experiment when studying it anyway.
*  So get on that list. That would be cool. Yeah. OK.
*  So so one of the main things that you study are these core cognitive
*  systems that we're born with and many of which you've already alluded to.
*  And so let's just walk through a couple of them and then we want to
*  and then we'll talk about the magic of human abilities here. OK.
*  As we develop. So object representation is one.
*  And this is something that we're born with.
*  And, you know, you can study until about 10 months,
*  if I remember correctly, from your from your work.
*  So so we like you like you just were mentioning, we we know what are two objects.
*  We know it's one objects under various conditions.
*  So I don't know what what do we know about object representation?
*  OK, so the first thing we've learned that was that babies
*  don't simply represent the parts of objects that are visible.
*  They represent the back of an object when you show them the front.
*  And when I say we, by the way, I don't mean me and my lab.
*  I mean the field.
*  Philip Kelman did beautiful studies showing that babies represent
*  the back of an object as well as the front of an object as it's moving around.
*  For example, we learned that when an object is partly hidden behind another object,
*  as long as it's moving, the infants extrapolate the connection
*  between its different visible parts and see it as a single connected body.
*  Subsequently, and this really surprised me, I didn't expect this to happen.
*  We discovered that if an object moves totally out of view,
*  the babies anticipations seem to presuppose that they think it's still there
*  behind whatever's hiding it.
*  And they make specific inferences about what kinds of interactions
*  between objects will happen when they're out of sight.
*  If one object is partly hidden behind a screen and another one moves toward it,
*  are they going to are they going to collide and change their motion
*  at the moment of impact? Right.
*  The evidence is that they do.
*  And it comes from these studies using preferential looking
*  and in some cases, other methods to get at how babies are tracking things
*  as they move in and out of view.
*  And then beyond that, studies showing that infants expect
*  that when objects contact each other, they'll interact in ways
*  that preserve the solidity of each of those objects.
*  They won't interpenetrate. Right.
*  So these are basic abstract properties of objects that as far as we can see,
*  as early as they've been tested for in human infants,
*  which I think goes down to only about two months of age.
*  So there's there's a two month kind of window in there
*  that hadn't been hasn't been tested for as far as you can see.
*  As early as they go, they're present.
*  Now, what's happened with that information is lots of people
*  started doing studies with monkeys or with cats
*  or eventually all the way down to newly hatched chicks.
*  And the nice thing about doing studies on these other animals, of course,
*  is that you could look at their brains,
*  but you can also do controlled rearing.
*  And there were beautiful studies done using controlled rearing methods
*  with chicks showing that the very first time that a chick is exposed to an object,
*  you see the same abilities that you see in in human infants.
*  Actually, I shouldn't say the same because the chicks are actually
*  a little bit ahead of the infants.
*  They've got better attention. They've got better working memory.
*  So the chicks will actually solve problems that Piaget showed infants
*  don't manage to solve until they're like eight months of age.
*  The chicks will do it on first exposure to an object.
*  Now, they're in a high state of motivation
*  because the method that's used in most of the chick studies is imprinting.
*  So that object for them becomes mom.
*  But they can be imprinted to mom under a very restricted set of conditions
*  where they never get to touch her, where they never see her move out of sight
*  behind an occluder or anything.
*  And then the very first time they're presented with events
*  where she goes behind an occluder, they expect that she won't pass through a wall,
*  that she'll still be there behind that occluder.
*  She won't blip out of existence there and appear somewhere else and so forth.
*  So that's an example, I think, of where when we do studies on infants,
*  they suggest questions that can be asked of animals.
*  And the two fields can converge to give us much more leverage
*  in understanding what the role of experience is and isn't in this development.
*  And eventually to understand what the brain is doing
*  and what the brain mechanisms are for tracking objects over time,
*  representing their existence and how a brain comes to
*  instantiate these abstract properties of objects like continuity and solidity and so forth.
*  But you started out by asking me about core knowledge.
*  And one side of it is that the knowledge that young infants have
*  and that other animals have seems to capture very abstract properties of the world,
*  like that objects exist continuously, they move on connected paths.
*  They occupy space uniquely, so two of them can't be in the same place at the same time.
*  But the other side of core knowledge is it's extremely impoverished.
*  There's most of what we take for granted as properties, obvious properties of objects.
*  Infants and chicks seem to be oblivious to.
*  So infants in particular have been, you know,
*  I've been really struck by the limits to what infants understand about objects.
*  And also about the environment that you navigate through and about agents,
*  animals and what they and their goals and intentions and things like that.
*  So infants have virtually no idea what an object ought to look like.
*  My first hypothesis when we started studying object representation in infants was
*  Gestalt psychologists will have it pretty much right.
*  They'll expect object simple and regular in their shapes.
*  Not true at all.
*  They don't use babies, don't use those Gestalt properties at all
*  for singling objects out, figuring out where one ends and the next one begins.
*  They were completely oblivious to all of that.
*  Don't they primarily use motion?
*  Is that one of the limitations? Yes, they do use motion.
*  They use but they use motion specifically that's consistent
*  with there being bodies that have stable boundaries that are all
*  internally interconnected, that are cohesive, remain connected as they move around.
*  So, yes, the motion is the primary source of information they get.
*  About the cohesiveness and the persistence over time
*  and the locations of objects as they interact and move around in a scene.
*  But other properties of objects, like what they should look like.
*  These are things that babies seem to be quite oblivious to.
*  And that that distinction shows up in every one of the domains
*  that people have looked at domains of knowledge in infancy.
*  So if you if you think about
*  what do infants and animals and here it's the work in animals
*  that I think is especially informative, understand about the world that we navigate through.
*  I think the evidence is pretty strong that what animals represent
*  is the ground surface and its borders.
*  And that's pretty much it.
*  They don't. And when I say they represent the ground surface,
*  they represent the geometric perturbations in the ground surface.
*  So if there's suddenly a cliff or if there's suddenly a wall
*  or suddenly a bump or a gap in the ground surface, animals track that.
*  And and when infants get old enough that they can start
*  toddling around in an environment, they track those properties.
*  But they don't track really things that look really obvious to us,
*  like the color of a wall or a very prominent set of markings on the floor
*  that don't perturb its three dimensional structure, but do, you know, provide
*  abrupt change in patterning from one color to another or one shape to another
*  printed on the floor. They're completely oblivious to that.
*  So I think that that this is it.
*  This is kind of a useful guide that
*  maybe the way to think about the the first steps of learning is that kids
*  have everything to learn about the local environment that they're going to find themselves in.
*  You know, what is my parent going to look like?
*  Oh, that's another beautiful example.
*  So babies come in the world expecting there are going to be people
*  who will attend to them and engage with them and talk to them, make noises,
*  vocalize, speak to them.
*  And I think the evidence very strongly suggests
*  it's from studies like of empathy where you could kind of pick out
*  the individual experiments.
*  But I think the evidence strongly suggests that they
*  infants assume that the creatures who engage with them have experiences
*  like their own and those experiences get exchanged in states of engagement.
*  These are highly abstract aspects of the social world.
*  But if you ask, what do they know about what people should look like?
*  And you can do that by giving them a choice between two faces,
*  a face of a human and a face of a sheep or a bird.
*  Right. Or you can do biological motion.
*  You can give biological motion of the sort that a human body produces
*  versus of the sort that a hen produces.
*  And what you see is that young infants are exquisitely sensitive
*  to the distinction between an upright face and an inverted face,
*  upright biological motion or inverted biological motion.
*  And they are completely oblivious to the distinction between biological motion
*  of a human versus a hen.
*  So, you know, the specifics of what's going to be out there are learned later.
*  And what what babies seem to start with is a set of very abstract notions
*  of what sorts of things they're going to be in the world.
*  They're going to be people for me to engage with.
*  There's going to be objects to manipulate.
*  There's going to be layouts to navigate through.
*  They have these abstract notions and then they learn the specifics later on.
*  It's almost like you have.
*  So let's say object representation is a core cognitive ability.
*  But then you have to think, well, what is core within the core, within the core?
*  You know, so it's like, where do you start?
*  And you got to go back to the egg in the sperm or something, you know.
*  So one of the one of the.
*  No, go ahead.
*  I mean, no, I don't want to go back to the egg in the sperm.
*  And I don't think that asking for what's the core means getting into an infinite
*  regress of some sort. I don't think that's true.
*  I mean, I want to go back to the beginning of the child's encounters
*  with an external world that actually has objects in it, that actually has places
*  to explore in it and ask at that point, what do kids already expect
*  that world to be like and what are they and what are they neutral about
*  and in a position to learn about?
*  And I think when you put research on young infants together
*  with research on other animals where you can do controlled rearing experiments,
*  which are really, I think, critical to making headway on on these questions,
*  then you start to get evidence that allows you to do that.
*  Now, this leaves open the question that you asked me earlier.
*  What do I hope to be able to brainstorm about with people at CCN?
*  This leaves open the question of how over the course of development
*  from the egg through all the fetal development, do you get to the point
*  where you're ready to encounter a world that has certain basic abstracts
*  properties, a certain geometrical structure, a certain causal structure?
*  You know, what set of events happens there?
*  And I'm hoping we can understand those those events.
*  I don't want to just kind of push them away and go all the way back to the egg
*  and say, OK, we're done. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Well, fetal fetal cognitive abilities are going to be even harder to to assess.
*  But one of the other recurring themes is in these core systems.
*  And we, you know, we'll talk about a few more here is is the limits
*  that are imposed.
*  Why are limits important to understand in understanding these core systems?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So I think the limits are important partly because I think imagine if there weren't.
*  Imagine that we learned that every ability that we have as adults,
*  we could find in young infants. OK.
*  If we did, then I submit we should not be wasting our time studying infants.
*  It's a whole lot easier to study adults and ask them questions.
*  If we're going to see the same complexity in a newborn infant
*  that we see in an adult, let's just study the adults before babies alone.
*  So I think it's the fact that they don't know everything.
*  In fact, they don't know almost anything of what we know. Right.
*  What they know is the tiniest, tiniest piece of what we come to know.
*  That's what I think makes them really interesting and really informative
*  about human cognition.
*  So that's the substantive answer.
*  There's also a methodological answer, and it goes sort of like this.
*  When we study infants, if we can find a very clear profile
*  of abilities and gaps, we can then ask,
*  can we find that same profile of abilities and gaps in another animal?
*  And if the answer is yes, we've got ourselves an animal model
*  that we can use for probing the brain,
*  for doing building computational models of a simpler system
*  than a full blown human, etc.
*  We can also ask, are there cognitive and brain processes in an adult
*  that show the same profile of limits as we see in the overt behavior of the infant?
*  And that'll help us to understand what happens to the infant's abilities.
*  So so one question that I stayed up nights over for a long time,
*  a couple of decades ago, was what I'm studying in the infants.
*  Is this a set of is this scaffolding?
*  Is this a set of abilities like a reflex that keeps you that keeps the infant
*  from getting killed when they're a baby,
*  but that's basically just going to be kicked away
*  and they're going to learn to understand the world in some different way.
*  That's possibility one.
*  Or are the abilities that we see in infants
*  the foundations of all of our abilities throughout life?
*  If it's the second, then we should be able to find cognitive tasks
*  where we can elicit those same that same profile of performance in an adult.
*  And we also want to be able to find ways of probing adult brains
*  where we'll see brain responses that accord with that pattern of performance.
*  And I think where we've looked, we've seen that in a number of domains.
*  The domain where it's richest is action planning, navigation, spatial reasoning.
*  I mean, there I think is the absolute richest domain where we can see the system
*  that we find in infants in behavioral experiments at work in our minds as
*  as adults and, of course, of course, also at work in the minds of rats
*  and the brains of rats where where most of the instruments came from originally.
*  So, yeah. So so I think limits are important for all of those reasons.
*  And then, by the way, once we once we find these abilities in adults,
*  there's a whole nother enterprise that can begin actually two enterprises.
*  One is to ask, what's the relationship between the core abilities
*  in the mind of an adult and all the fancy things that the adult does
*  and the infant doesn't write?
*  And then people like I love the work of people like Stan Dehaan,
*  who show studying mathematicians that when you give a mathematician
*  some high level problem to think about in mathematics, they activate,
*  among other things, they activate the system that debate that's active
*  in a baby when they see an array of 20 dots and compare it to an array of 10 dots.
*  Right. That you can draw a line of continuity there.
*  You don't know what the causal relationships are or what the computations are.
*  But at least you can say there's a continuity there,
*  which gives us something to go on in probing these abilities further.
*  So that's one enterprise.
*  The other enterprise that becomes possible at that point is now you can turn to children.
*  And maybe this is what you were asking me about before.
*  When you brought up children, you can turn to children
*  who are just taking their first steps into a uniquely human domain.
*  So, say, first graders who are just starting to learn arithmetic
*  or just starting to learn to read.
*  And you can ask, can we find evidence for this same system
*  with the same profile of abilities and limits that we see in infants
*  at work in some subsystem in the child at the point at which they're developing
*  an understanding of symbols and this other uniquely human stuff?
*  And can we move their understanding of, you know, symbolic math, say, around
*  by exercising their non symbolic abilities?
*  So there's that's kind of another research enterprise that I think opens up.
*  And all of it ultimately is anchored to this ability to to get hold of these
*  very, very simple systems with these very distinctive profiles in infancy
*  and then look for those profiles elsewhere.
*  In that sense, I think it's kind of psychophysics applied to central
*  cognition, cognitive science. Oh, very good.
*  So, OK, so object recognition, one
*  aspects of recognizing objects, one core cognitive ability.
*  And just as a teaser with regards to language,
*  I think it's fascinating that with regards to language and limits that pre-language
*  infants consider like two things to be when they join.
*  I'm not describing the experiment well enough, but let's say the example
*  you give is a truck and a duck and they come together and
*  they're manipulated and babies.
*  Infants don't can't distinguish between the two of them.
*  They think it's like one object, right, when they're stuck together,
*  even though they look completely different.
*  But then once they have the the faculty of and they know the name duck
*  and they know the name truck, then they can distinguish.
*  So it's the language that's key for being able to distinguish these two objects
*  relative to one, which is fascinating. Yeah.
*  Yeah. This is work by Fei Xu and Susan Carey.
*  And it's had a huge influence on me. Oh, yeah.
*  And I think especially Fei has carried it forward and showed that
*  going beyond those initial studies and showed that you don't even once kids
*  understand sentences, you don't even need to use familiar words like duck and truck.
*  You can look into a box and you can say, wow, a blicket, a toma.
*  And they expect there to be two objects in the box, right?
*  As if, you know, they've gotten to the point where they understand language enough
*  that they can now use language to learn more language
*  and make sense of nonsense words like blicket and toma.
*  And they can use language to learn more about the world and make a get,
*  you know, an educated guess about what's inside that box.
*  There's going to be two things that Fei Xu showed.
*  There's going to be two things.
*  They're going to have different properties.
*  So kids are at the point where they can use language to learn more language
*  and also to learn about the world.
*  And to me, that that was the revelation.
*  Not that the younger child doesn't use
*  the different features of the objects to figure out this thing
*  that came out on one side with duck like features.
*  And the thing that came out on the other side with truck like features
*  are two different things. Right.
*  I mean, that's the that's the problem that the kids are getting wrong.
*  And that and a bunch of other problems of that sort are
*  what the younger kids are getting wrong.
*  But when you think about it, it's not always the case
*  that all of the features of an object that you see at one time will be there
*  when you see that same object at another time.
*  If it I mean, if the truck was a transformer,
*  it might change its configuration while it's hidden.
*  If it's an animal, it might change its posture.
*  So the kids are relying on a subset of the information
*  about objects that we're capable of relying on as adults.
*  But what they're doing within the limits of their abilities
*  is they're relying on the most reliable information about objects.
*  But what happens then once language comes along is you can go further
*  and you can see what conceptual distinctions other people are making.
*  When people use two different words to talk about things inside a box,
*  they're they're indicating to you that there's two things there
*  and that there's some important difference between them,
*  because if there weren't, they would have said a blanket and another blanket.
*  Right.
*  And I think kids are very, very good at picking up on that.
*  Adults say these things naturally.
*  I don't think we're trying to teach kids anything when we talk like that.
*  But we're talking in a way that maximizes the efficiency
*  and the relevance of our communications.
*  And I think kids are built to take advantage of that,
*  to assume that that's the case and to use it to learn about the world.
*  And to me, that's what the shoe and carry experiments
*  that you referred to are getting at.
*  Yeah, it's fascinating.
*  A few of the other.
*  So there are six core systems that at least in my memory that they talk about.
*  Another one I'm going to rattle off a few and then we'll kind of dive
*  it a little bit deeper into one or two more of them before we move on.
*  One of them is just the faculty of number one to infinity.
*  It's like sort of our early number
*  abilities, places so that we can the kids can navigate infants.
*  I have some conception of place and some conception of geometrical forms,
*  like shapes, like triangles and things like that.
*  And what I want to dive a little bit more
*  deeply into, because we're going to come back to it, I think, is
*  that there are two ways in which infants represent agents.
*  Well, people, I suppose.
*  Yeah.
*  One is people as agents so that they distinguish between something that's
*  inanimate and animate, which is this ties back to my talk
*  with Talia Konkol, who talks about animacy versus inanimacy in our visual cortex.
*  And she'll be talking at CCN2.
*  And the other is
*  people as souls, as people.
*  Yes.
*  So I don't know.
*  So let's wax poetic for a moment just about about what we're talking about.
*  For a moment, just about about what what those core systems are for agency and
*  people. Yeah.
*  First of all, I should say that this is by no means a universally accepted idea.
*  I'm not even sure 100 percent of the time how strongly I would bet on it.
*  I just
*  tended to assume that if there was any system for thinking about people, there
*  would be just one system, and it was really a whole bunch of
*  experiments on infants that kept giving these seemingly contradictory
*  findings that finally drove me to this idea that really babies understand people
*  by dividing and conquering and thinking about the minds of other people in two
*  different ways. And one way of thinking about the minds
*  of other people is that to think that other people represent the world as it's
*  perceptually accessible to them and they plan actions,
*  modulo their representations of the accessible world, taking account of what
*  they have access to in the external world, they plan actions, they direct their
*  actions to goals, which often are goal objects.
*  They act efficiently, minimizing the cost of their actions.
*  They choose goals of higher value over goals of lower value and so forth.
*  And this is all a system for reasoning
*  about actions as intentional, costly and effective.
*  Oh, and also they see people's actions as causal.
*  They they cause changes in the world.
*  So people by acting bring about changes in the world.
*  And that's one system.
*  And another system is for seeing people as having experiences like the child's own
*  experiences and engaging with one another and in states of engagement,
*  sharing those experiences, conveying their experiences to the other person and picking
*  up on the other person's experiences of them.
*  And the evidence for this, I think, comes from two sources.
*  One, which is hard to manipulate and be really sure about, is 50 years worth of
*  experiments or observations is maybe a better term than experiments.
*  Observations on children's reactions to other people, children's tendency to imitate
*  the actions of other people who look at them, their high sensitivity
*  to another person's direction of gaze, the fact that a child will look much more
*  at a face whose eyes are directed at them than off to the side.
*  All these their sensitivity to other people's speech, not what they're saying,
*  but the fact that they're speaking to the infant and modulating their speech in the
*  way that adults do when they talk, slowing it down the way they do when they
*  talk to infants, these kind of all of these things suggests that babies are prepared
*  to be especially attentive to other people that we looking at them from the outside,
*  we would say are potential social partners for those babies.
*  But the other line of evidence comes from
*  experiments where you put the baby in the position of a third party observer to an
*  interaction between two other beings who have some of the properties of social
*  beings, namely faces emitting sounds that seem to be contingent on each other and so
*  forth. And there I think the evidence is more
*  convincing that infants distinguish between other people who are in a state of
*  engagement with one another versus people who are not engaged with each other.
*  They make different predictions about who's
*  going to approach, who who's going to imitate, who who's going to talk back to
*  who in those different situations and none of the constraints that seem to matter
*  when you're reasoning about somebody's causal effects on the world, like are they
*  in contact with the thing that they're causing a change in?
*  Are they acting efficiently?
*  None of those things seem to apply in the social domain.
*  Even for us as adults, I mean, if anything,
*  I think social interactions that are too efficient seem rude.
*  They're effective.
*  You're supposed to have small talk with the start of your interviews.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  I really think that, you know, there's a different set of considerations that comes
*  into play when you're communicating with a person versus when you're acting on an
*  object and trying to bring about a change in it.
*  And kids, I think, are able to view people,
*  other people in each of these two ways,
*  maybe even simultaneously under some conditions, but the systems that are
*  looking at what somebody's doing on objects in the world versus who are they
*  engaged with and what are they feeling and what are they trying to convey
*  that those are that those are two different cognitive systems, I think.
*  Yeah. OK, so we have a bunch of early core
*  cognitive systems and they have these properties that they're fairly independent.
*  They, you know, they're shared by other animals.
*  So at this point, we're just another animal.
*  These are innate so that, you know,
*  they're when we come out of the womb, they're there ready for us.
*  You talked about some of the limits.
*  That's a core feature of these core systems is that they're limited
*  and they kind of set the foundation for learning things later in life and becoming
*  human, as it were.
*  Some things like like solidity we know innately, right?
*  Like from these core systems, but other things like gravity we have to learn over
*  time. Do you think it's important in general?
*  Do we need to emulate in AI systems how
*  infants develop these cognitive abilities over time or can we just skip
*  and go in different orders, you know, and just build in what's necessary to the AI
*  systems? Yeah, I think I think that's a good question.
*  And since I don't work in AI, I'm probably not the best person
*  to answer it. My own hunch would be that it's very
*  worth trying to build an AI system that starts with the abstract notions
*  that that human infants and other animals seem to start with.
*  I think this is worth trying and then see how that system,
*  what it takes to get that system to learn the rest.
*  But I wouldn't want to make the argument
*  that that's the only path that makes sense to try.
*  People should try lots of different things.
*  Well, one of the things that you've said
*  that you think makes us gives us a fundamental advantage and makes us human
*  and uniquely human is the ability to take these core systems and combine them and to
*  have crosstalk between them to form abstract concepts.
*  Right. I've heard you talk about both
*  language and social cognition, and you've already talked about it today
*  as examples of what what make us special.
*  How so?
*  So I am on board, right?
*  You have these these core cognitive abilities and then you're going to combine
*  them and then that's going to give rise to abstract concepts.
*  How might this happen?
*  Right. For instance, like we were just talking about with with people.
*  So you have the core system of agents and you have the core system of like a social
*  beings and then you add them together and you get people that we have abstract
*  concepts for. And this sounds like it's a great strategy for AI.
*  Like you just said.
*  So two questions. One is just the grand
*  scheme of like, oh, how the hell would that happen?
*  You know, computationally, for instance.
*  But the other thing I'm thinking of is so
*  nonhuman animal animals have the same core systems but are missing this
*  combinatorial magic. And so what is that magic?
*  What's the magic?
*  Yeah.
*  So that, I think, is the great open question.
*  I mean, another way to say that that question, I think, is what's distinctive
*  about human cognition relative to other animals?
*  And a third way to say it is how do children learn and what puts children on a
*  path of learning that's different from the learning that we see in other animals?
*  I think those are three different ways of stating the same question.
*  And I think we don't know the answer.
*  And what makes me so excited about this particular moment in our intellectual
*  history is I think we have the tools that we need to get to the answer.
*  So what I want to offer in my in my CCN talk is a hypothesis about this.
*  And it's a hypothesis that could easily turn out to be wrong.
*  I think it's the one that I would bet money on at this point, though.
*  And that is that what's special about us is actually a very old idea.
*  What's special about us is that we have
*  the capacity to learn and use a natural language.
*  And natural languages have a number of properties, one of the most important ones
*  being a property that I only came to appreciate over the last 10 years or so,
*  largely through interacting with computational folks.
*  So maybe I should start with that property.
*  The thing about natural language is that I used to think was just a bug in the
*  system, right, or an inconvenience, and that I now think is a super positive
*  feature of languages is that they're learned and they're learned from other people,
*  other people, you learn a language from people who engage with you and who share
*  their thoughts with you by speaking.
*  That's basically how languages are learned by kids.
*  Now, the people who are speaking speak
*  relevantly about and offer ideas that they think are worth spreading.
*  Right. You talk about things that you think are going to be interesting.
*  You also tend to talk economically.
*  You don't give too much information.
*  You give the information that you think is really relevant to this situation.
*  So now imagine you're a child and you're
*  learning language from the people around you.
*  OK, the languages that you're learning, all of the human languages are
*  productively combinatorial, so you have a lexicon, but you can always add new words
*  to it. And now in these days, with all the insane pace of technological
*  innovation, we're learning we're adding new words to them all the time.
*  Right. So you can always add new words.
*  But once you know the meanings of the individual words and the classes,
*  the grammatical classes that they belong to, now you can form infinitely many
*  expressions and magically somehow you get the meaning of the whole expression
*  from the meanings of the words and the ways in which they've been combined.
*  Right. So that means that language gives kids a very powerful mechanism for
*  expressing any concept that any human could have, past, present or future.
*  But it also gives them a terrible search problem.
*  And this is where I think interacting
*  with computational folks really got me going.
*  Imagine you're an animal and you have an innate language of thought.
*  And it has all of the power that we use in using a natural language to express
*  any concept that we could possibly invent or design or anything else.
*  Put all of that into a mind of an animal and ask, what is the animal going to do
*  with all of these concepts, which one should they draw on in any given situation?
*  Right. They've got these gazillions of concepts in there.
*  What is each of them going to be useful for?
*  And that's the problem, I think, that we solve by learning our languages.
*  Learning them from the people around them,
*  around us, who speak about things that they think are relevant to the current
*  situation and express their thoughts about that situation.
*  What this allows for is that a child who's learning a language,
*  some of the very mundane features of language learning, like word frequency
*  effects, kids learn frequent words before they learn infrequent words.
*  Right.
*  The more frequent words are going to be the words that the people in that
*  particular culture that the child is learning to make their way in, consider
*  to be more worth using to express thoughts.
*  Right.
*  So they're going to be getting the more useful concepts before the less useful
*  concepts, they're going to be getting them in contexts where people find them to be
*  relevant. I think language becomes a really excellent guide to help kids to navigate
*  through what would otherwise be this immensely unmanageable search space of
*  conceptual possibilities to find their way to the concepts that are most
*  immediately useful in the particular situations that the kids find themselves in.
*  So for me, that's really a central property of of language that I think makes it an
*  extremely useful tool for thinking.
*  And I think it would be very fun to
*  engage with people in artificial intelligence who have made a whole lot of
*  progress in getting machines to understand and produce language, to think about how
*  to leverage that, to do something with language that children are already doing
*  at nine months, nine to ten months of age in facials experiments.
*  They're using language to learn about the world.
*  They're using what people say to figure out what's out there as well as to learn
*  more language itself. And so, yeah, I mean, that's my current hunch as to what sets
*  us on a path different from the other animals, starting with equipment that's so
*  similar. Is it language in itself?
*  So I'm kind of visualizing these six core
*  systems and then the thing that binds them together.
*  And is it language itself or is it the faculty for language?
*  And I'm not sure how distinguishable those two things are.
*  Yeah, I'm not sure.
*  I mean, I think those are the questions
*  that we would need to get much more specific on if we wanted to build
*  computational models of this kind of learning.
*  And I'm not sure what the what the best answer is going to be.
*  Sometimes I think there just is this
*  immense language of thought that every animal brain makes available.
*  And animals just don't know how to search it very well.
*  And we know how to search it much better because we learn in natural language.
*  That's one possibility. Right.
*  But another possibility is no, the basic
*  function of composition is used by humans or perhaps.
*  Well, there's two possible two other two alternative possibilities.
*  One alternative possibility is that what's special to us is this compositional
*  capacity to combine anything with anything else, as opposed to simply within
*  a particular dedicated domain, clearly we have compositional abilities
*  within the navigation system and so forth.
*  But this general purpose ability to combine anything with anything else could be
*  what's distinctive about us.
*  And I think a third possibility is that
*  what's distinctive about us is our ability to create external symbols and use them
*  and expect other people to create them and learn from them.
*  And I think every animal has symbolic abilities.
*  Symbols I love.
*  So I one of the classes that I should have gone more more to that I should have
*  attended more in college is about the origins of language.
*  And this was taught by someone who studied early cuneiform and
*  just how language came about in Mesopotamia and in the Fertile Crescent region.
*  Denise Schmalte-Bessorette.
*  I'm sorry that I didn't go to class more, but I loved it.
*  I love the ideas.
*  And her whole thing was the idea was that language came about
*  from our ability to represent symbols and to have an internal
*  internal representation of symbols, which came from the external representation
*  of how many sheep you get for however many you know, whatever I get for however many
*  sheep. So I love the idea of of symbols being important.
*  Yeah.
*  Thinking about natural language, we don't have too much more time here.
*  I recently heard Stephen Wolfram
*  talking about code as a potential
*  sort of replacement for language or developing a way to communicate.
*  But because when you code, you're doing you're thinking computationally and you're
*  thinking efficiently and a lot of our language, it is efficient relative to many
*  things, but it's also quite inefficient relative to other means of
*  communicating. And he sort of envisions I don't want to speak for him.
*  But the way he was talking, it's almost like he envisioned coding to take over.
*  So he gives an example of maybe you'll go to a restaurant and the menu will be in
*  code and not in a natural language that we've developed.
*  But I don't I'm not sure that language seems to develop that way.
*  I don't know if you have thoughts about this.
*  Well, language changes all the time.
*  And I think one of the reasons that it
*  changes is that it is an extremely efficient system.
*  And when our needs change, we coin new terms, we use new expressions,
*  we take new shortcuts.
*  So so actually, I think it's very, very likely that the language that we're
*  speaking in the future will be different from what we're speaking now.
*  I doubt very much, though, that this will
*  happen because people design some new computer language and everybody
*  decides to adopt it. I think it's going to happen the way language change has
*  happened in the past as people's lives change and as their needs change,
*  they they change the language with them
*  so that they can continue to communicate efficiently and effectively.
*  Yeah, the beautiful mess that is humanity.
*  I also really I'm not sure if you're familiar with David Christian.
*  He teaches big history.
*  It's a concept anyway.
*  I recently heard him talking about how he expressed what he has come to about how
*  humans are unique is that essentially they accumulate information faster than
*  than if information dissipates. Right.
*  So other animals,
*  they might learn something about their life, but they can't pass it down because
*  there's no way to symbolically represent it for their future
*  generations to just pick up.
*  And language is the key, essentially, in in communicating from
*  human down the generations.
*  And I just and that has a lot to do with representing symbols.
*  So I don't know. It's just.
*  Yeah, no, I think that's right.
*  Internal language.
*  OK, so we develop language and it let's let's just say that language is the key
*  here and we develop this cognitive ability.
*  I've talked a little bit on the show.
*  I had David Popple on and he studies speech processing and language.
*  And I was talking to him about how
*  language actually affects our own internal thinking.
*  So not only can we express some version of our internal thoughts, but by expressing
*  them either internally, writing them down or expressing them in words, it can
*  actually change what what we think.
*  Do you think that language is more important for our internal thought
*  processes or for communicating with others?
*  I think it's crucial for both.
*  And I think that when we use it internally, we're communicating with ourselves in
*  effect. So I don't see these as distinct functions.
*  It seems to me that language makes explicit certain concepts and and
*  relations, which which makes them both
*  communicable and also gives us a medium in which we can think about them better in
*  many cases. And you've also mentioned that the early
*  social ability, one of these core the core social system that we're built,
*  built with, that we come into the world with
*  directly leads to sharing of feelings or empathy.
*  Do you think that empathy will be important to build into AI or to build the core
*  system that will lead to the learning of empathy?
*  And do you think that will be difficult?
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  I don't know what I think.
*  Actually, your question brings up a question about the future of AI, which which
*  I don't have a good answer to.
*  It's a question I've been thinking about a lot.
*  It is what kind of AI do we want?
*  What kind of AI is going to be good for us and useful for us?
*  Right. And will it be useful to have machines that not only have our common
*  sense, but that have our feelings and that interact with us the way people do?
*  Do we want machines that are going to be
*  replacing people in effect? And I can think of lots of situations
*  where the answer would be, yes, we would want that.
*  Right. Rather than having some really
*  bored, overworked person taking care of me in a nursing home in 20 years.
*  Right. Maybe it would be better to have
*  a very sympathetic machine doing that. I don't know.
*  I can think of at least five people I'd love to replace.
*  In any case, I think this is a really important question.
*  I'm not convinced that we want machines to have empathy.
*  And I'm fairly certain that we don't that there are some machines that we don't
*  want to have empathy. Let me give an example from today.
*  We don't need to think about some glorious future.
*  So my children and consequently their
*  grandchildren have as a member of their household, Alexa.
*  Oh, yeah. And parents talk to Alexa.
*  They ask Alexa what the weather is going to be tomorrow.
*  They ask her to time something that they're cooking.
*  They they ask her for music and so forth.
*  They don't say please and thank you.
*  They don't expect her to be able to answer hard questions.
*  They treat her as a fairly stupid but useful machine.
*  And I think and I've wondered in watching
*  my grandchildren, how do they feel about Alexa?
*  And I think they feel Alexa's a machine.
*  And I think that's a good thing.
*  I don't think I want Alexa to start showing
*  empathy and to start giving my grandchildren the idea that we've brought back slavery.
*  Alexa has is human and we're treating her like our personal slave.
*  Right. You think you don't need to be polite to that.
*  You can simply get things from without asking nicely.
*  You know what I mean? I feel like we don't want that.
*  So I'm not sure.
*  What I mostly feel is our conversation has
*  focused to the extent that it's focused on AI.
*  It's on the question, can research on human
*  development inform the development of smarter machines, more effective machines?
*  But I think there's another question we could ask.
*  And I think anybody who's working in AI should be asking themselves this question,
*  which is what kind of AI should we be
*  developing with the ultimate goal of human benefit?
*  And for that, it seems to me it would be very useful to take another look at human
*  minds and the development of human minds and ask what are the circumstances in
*  which human minds thrive, in which we develop a healthy sense of ourselves,
*  healthy relationships with other people and so forth.
*  And how can we build machines that will
*  offload things that get in the way of our doing that, but not create situations that
*  get the alternative, right, creating situations that actually get in the way
*  of our being human with each other as they start to take on more and more human
*  like functions. I think that's going to be a very important
*  question for people in AI to be thinking about and another whole domain of questions
*  that it could be really useful for people who study brains and minds
*  and machines to be working together.
*  Don't we already have enough to do? Come on.
*  Just quickly about the core systems.
*  Are there any longitudinal studies that that are that ask the question if this
*  infant has this core ability and develops it at this age, then later,
*  you know, like the marshmallow test and later in life, they'll win a Nobel Prize
*  or something? Yeah, it's not clear.
*  Interpretations of the marshmallow test have been changing recently.
*  But but but I take your question.
*  There's lots of studies like that. They show correlations.
*  There's a huge limit to those studies.
*  They don't tell us what's causing what.
*  So we know that you use a child's core abilities to predict what's going to
*  happen later. But what but what we really want to know is what what's driving that
*  those later developments and what role are the core abilities playing in that.
*  One thing I've gotten very excited about
*  going beyond correlations is doing field research and education.
*  And we're starting to do studies in India and other countries where we see,
*  can we move children, children, can we enhance children's readiness,
*  taking especially children who are at risk of not doing well in school?
*  If we if we able to play with them as preschoolers, can we enhance their
*  readiness for learning school math or we hope to look at things like learning
*  to read in school, learning to learn from other people in in in school by giving them
*  the kinds of experiences that middle class kids will routinely get.
*  But that may be less accessible to kids living in poverty.
*  And there I think what potentially we can gain, in addition to the human benefit,
*  I hope, is a greater understanding of what moves development forward in the real
*  world on the timescales where kids are really learning.
*  So I'm very excited about that line of work, which builds off the findings that
*  there are correlations in longitudinal studies between earlier abilities and
*  later abilities, but tries to actually get at causation.
*  Yeah, so much to do.
*  Liz, we pretty much run out of time here.
*  I was going to ask you about why women are so bad at science.
*  And
*  other fun questions that you could answer in 10 seconds or less.
*  You know, I'll ask you two two more quick questions.
*  So sorry, I was alluding to, you know, your
*  I know your previous debates with Steven Pinker on gender roles and just your work
*  in general on on showing that there's no difference between males and females
*  in infancy. I just had to get it there.
*  So I didn't get hate mail.
*  So one, how many years into the future would you want to jump
*  to observe what's going on for just a bit?
*  I love that question.
*  I would love to jump a short distance into the future.
*  I'd like to like to jump like 10 years from now, maybe 15, because I think we're
*  at a really exciting point right now in these fields that are coming together at
*  CCN and I'm really excited to see where we go from here.
*  Awesome.
*  Finally, you say, I don't know a lot.
*  It's very admirable.
*  It's you have a lot of humility.
*  What do you think the right balance is between sticking?
*  This is a related question.
*  What do you think the right balance is
*  between sticking to your gut versus adjusting your beliefs about how
*  to proceed just in science and moving forward in your own career in science?
*  Yeah.
*  Let me say something more general about science that we'll get to this point.
*  OK, I think if I have a religion, my religion is science.
*  I believe in science.
*  I think if we look back over human history,
*  we have seen more progress in science than in any other domain of human culture.
*  If you compare what we know now to what we knew 100 years ago or a thousand years
*  ago or three thousand years ago, I mean, the differences in the domain of science
*  are immense, and I think they dwarf the differences that we see in any other
*  domain, and that raises the question, what made this happen?
*  Why has science been so successful?
*  And I think the reason it's been so successful is twofold.
*  First of all, it's a cumulative enterprise.
*  So people build on each other, just like kids learn from the people around them.
*  Scientists learn from the scientists around them and they build on other
*  people's work and it accumulates.
*  And one of the things that makes it accumulate is that people do stick
*  to their guns and they push their ideas as far as they can.
*  So on that side of the question, I think that's one of the reasons why science has
*  been so successful.
*  But I think the other reason it's been
*  successful is kind of on the opposite side of your question.
*  We get to ask questions of nature, but we don't get to dictate what the answer is
*  going to be, what the answers turn out to be depends on how the world turns out to be.
*  So at the end of the day, we have to give up our cherished views
*  when the world is just keeps telling us that's not the way it's working.
*  Right. And that and again and again, we see that that's happened in science as well.
*  So I actually think I love your question
*  because it brings up the two sides of the scientific enterprise, both of which I
*  think are really critical to it and both kind of together account for its success
*  in the past and make me optimistic about the next 10 years.
*  Oh, man, that's a beautiful place to end.
*  You have a plane to catch to Berlin.
*  So do I. Thank you.
