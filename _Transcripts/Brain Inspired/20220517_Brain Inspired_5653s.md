# BI 136 Michel Bitbol and Alex Gomez-Marin: Phenomenology
**Brain Inspired:** [May 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZDTmdPO9sQ)
*  This problem has been raised times and again, and to my knowledge has never found a satisfactory
*  answer.
*  Even though you find plenty of interesting answers, there is not one answer that satisfied
*  everyone.
*  But everybody would agree that unless we really think that animals and ourselves are zombie
*  machines that we are dealing with subjects.
*  Nevertheless, we only know how to study them scientifically as if they weren't subjects.
*  In a society in which the extreme objectification, that is the condition of possibility of science,
*  would not have been invented and imposed on many communities, then Phenology would have
*  been a matter of course.
*  When it comes to mind or consciousness, we neuroscientists often ask how does the brain
*  generate or produce consciousness?
*  But then I start asking whether it does.
*  But this is a taboo question.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hi everyone, I'm Paul.
*  Hope you're doing well.
*  On this episode, we're taking a step back, you could say, and discussing Phenomenology,
*  which in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is defined as the study of structures of consciousness
*  as experienced from the first-person point of view.
*  One of the things Phenomenology reminds us of in science is that all of our measurements
*  and observations are necessarily experienced by us through our personal perceptions.
*  So in a strong sense, our interpretation of the world and of our scientific findings begins
*  with our first-person experiences.
*  However much we want to claim that what we're describing and explaining is objective and
*  not dependent on us as living, experiencing beings.
*  Michel Bittboll is an ex-physicist turned philosopher of science.
*  He's the director of research at CNRS, which is the Centro Nacional de la Research Cientifique.
*  I'm sure I butchered that, so apologies.
*  And he has written extensively about how the phenomenological perspective resolves many
*  of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics that arise when we treat quantum mechanics as an
*  interpretation of what's real.
*  Later he studied with Francisco Varela, who championed the phenomenological approach in
*  the life sciences, and Michel continues to apply the phenomenological approach to the
*  philosophy of mind.
*  Alex Gomez-Marín runs the Behavior of Organisms Lab at the Instituto de Neurociencias en Alicante.
*  Alex is also an ex-physicist who turned to biology and to neuroscience, and he has come
*  to appreciate the phenomenological approach.
*  So we discuss phenomenology itself, how both Michel and Alex came to appreciate it, some
*  of the ways it helps us interpret quantum mechanics and science in general, what role
*  it has to play as perhaps a complement to the training many of us have received to perform
*  objective science, and we discuss a lot more.

*  Okay, I hope you enjoyed the discussion.
*  I always have trouble figuring out where to start in these kinds of conversations, and
*  I think that this is the most trouble I've had speaking with both of you.
*  So first of all, welcome, Michel, welcome, Alex, and thanks for being here.
*  Thank you.
*  That's a promising start.
*  Thank you.
*  But there's so much that we can talk about.
*  I thought maybe a good place to start would be what's called the blind spot of scientific
*  endeavors.
*  Would you guys agree?
*  Would that be a good place to start?
*  And if so, Michel, would you want to describe the blind spot?
*  And then Alex, you can correct Michel, of course.
*  Okay.
*  So in fact, I have a lot to say about the blind spot.
*  Even though precisely because it cannot be seen by definition, by construction, it is
*  an item which is completely absent from the visual field and yet is absolutely crucial.
*  And the fact that it is missing can trigger havoc in the whole of knowledge.
*  Okay.
*  So what is this blind spot after all?
*  And is it something new in the history of knowledge?
*  First of all, I would like to say that it's by no means new.
*  It is known at least from the time of ancient India, from the time of the Upanishads or
*  maybe even earlier.
*  And I like to quote a certain sentence from one of the oldest Upanishads in which it is
*  said, it is not seen, but it is the seer.
*  It is not heard, but it is the hearer.
*  It is not felt, but it is the one who feels.
*  So the idea is very simple.
*  What is missing from our visual field, as Wittgenstein would have it, it's nothing else
*  than the eye itself.
*  Okay.
*  The eye cannot be seen in the visual field.
*  Our body is presupposed by any action we can take in the laboratory, but we don't care
*  for it.
*  And even deeper, our experience is that through which everything is given and shown to us,
*  but we don't see it.
*  We don't even bother about it.
*  So there is something, something which is not a thing, from which everything is known
*  and is ignored by knowledge because the from which cannot be seen on the screen of the
*  objects of knowledge.
*  The from which any object is seen, known, appreciated cannot be known by itself.
*  It can be known only by a sort of deduction in the reverse way, namely from the known
*  to the source of knowledge.
*  And this, I think, was said very beautifully by Immanuel Kant, the famous German philosopher
*  of the 18th century.
*  You know, he was confronted with what he called speculative metaphysics, in which people try
*  get through appearances, through phenomena, to identify what is really real, what is more
*  real than appearances, what is behind appearances.
*  But when they do that, they use a tool of their mind called reason.
*  They deduce things and they try to elaborate a theory about what is hidden behind the appearances
*  from their knowledge of appearances.
*  Okay, they do that, but usually they do that with little success.
*  Metaphysics has always been very difficult to carry on.
*  And Kant says, oh, it's very simple why you have so little success.
*  It's because you use your reason to get through appearances to reality, but you don't even
*  try to question your own reason.
*  You don't reflect on your own reason.
*  You use it as if it were a window, a transparent window through which you can see reality,
*  and you don't really try to set the conditions for your reason to be able to go through appearances
*  to reality.
*  Since you don't know your reason, since you don't bother about this condition of possibility,
*  then of course you are going astray.
*  So reason here was the blind spot of metaphysical knowledge according to Kant.
*  Okay, so maybe I can stop here because I could speak for house about that and give Alex the
*  opportunity to ask questions about this.
*  When I talk to Michel and also today, I feel like going cycling and I just need to be drafting
*  behind him because he's just so knowledgeable about those things.
*  Maybe I'll just rephrase what Michel said in my own way of putting it.
*  So to me, the blind spot, well, it's like a fractal structure of blind spots.
*  There are many, Michel mentioned many.
*  But to me, the main one is lived experience.
*  And that's very relevant to neuroscience.
*  And so it's that very simple idea that we don't see the very thing that allows us to see.
*  And well, this is not very popular, right?
*  Because to begin with, as Michel just said, it's not new.
*  So where's the novelty, the editor may ask, but also it's somewhat obvious, although
*  non-trivial and it's hidden in plain sight.
*  So it has all these qualities of something that we would systematically miss.
*  The problem that I see with it is that, well, we may not see it, but if we choose to ignore
*  it or deny it the moment we're confronted with it, then it's a whole different problem.
*  And this has happened.
*  We can talk about, I mean, this has to do with the foundations of science that it has
*  In quantum mechanics and in Godel's theorem and also today in consciousness studies.
*  So it's like the replicas of this awareness that there's something very fundamental that
*  we're taking for granted and systematically missing.
*  And well, I think our effort is to just say it again, just say again that there's something
*  upon which everything is based and that not only we forget about it, that we even try to
*  explain it away.
*  So it's a very strange situation to talk about the blind spot because of what we do with
*  it.
*  And let me just add one more thing.
*  We can talk about the blind spot with respect to the scientific world view.
*  I'm going to already start putting the isms out, but it's even worse within the
*  mechanistic reductionist materialist doctrine because other approaches to science and
*  philosophy may be more sympathetic to acknowledging that there is a blind spot, even if
*  we fail to the justice to it, as Michelle was saying.
*  Since you mentioned neuroscience and this podcast is focused a lot on neuroscience,
*  learning more about the blind spot.
*  One notion is that as scientists, we go on about our business completely unaware of this
*  fact.
*  But then I also have a then I had to question my own history and how I, you know, my
*  intellectual thoughts have developed.
*  And another way to approach it is to say, well, like you said, Alex, it's obvious and that it's
*  implicit and assumed by many scientists, whatever field of study they're in, whether they
*  explicitly acknowledge it or not.
*  And so you talked about the novelty and I don't know if you've had editors comment on this.
*  It sounds like maybe you have with manuscripts.
*  Where's the novelty?
*  But how much of it do you think is sort of implicit and not so much explained away, but just
*  implicit as if it's background knowledge for all of us, do you think in the world of researchers
*  and how much we're ignorant of it or the field is ignorant of it?
*  Well, the way I like to put it, and I don't want to start saying we should be doing these or
*  we're doing this wrong, but at least we do a kind of a magic trick, sleight of hand.
*  I like to put it in this way.
*  Neuroscience is usually about having two subjects, starting with two subjects and ending
*  very quickly with one object.
*  So it's a very strange trick.
*  Let's say myself and a mouse, myself and the human subject I'm studying,
*  we're both living minded organisms, but very quickly the animal is treated as an object
*  that I'll study and the scientist pretends he or she is not there.
*  So in a way we're trained to do that.
*  I call it the kind of the yoga of objectivity.
*  We're like very precise swords.
*  Virtually all our training is to be able to excel at doing that.
*  Here we are, there's a moment where you realize, especially in the life and mind sciences,
*  you realize that perhaps we're missing something really fundamental.
*  And so there's a process of untraining and that's unlearning maybe.
*  And that's why I started to draw on phenomenology,
*  as perhaps Michel will explain later because he really knows phenomenology.
*  Beginner student of it.
*  But I realized that there's this thing missing and so how can we bring it back?
*  It's a whole new process of learning another yoga, you could say, not of objectivity,
*  but of subjectivity.
*  But of course that easily falls into dualities, the objective, the subjective, the isms.
*  And then because neuroscientists at least, we need to publish paper, write grants and so on.
*  There's no time for this anymore.
*  So we're back to square one.
*  But everybody would agree that unless we really think that animals and ourselves are
*  zombie machines, that we're dealing with subjects.
*  Nevertheless, we only know how to study them scientifically as if they weren't subjects.
*  And so there's kind of an intersubjectivity kind of blind spot there as well.
*  Michel, when you began speaking, you used the word crucial.
*  That cruciality is a lot of what is interesting to me.
*  This is a huge question.
*  Why is it crucial?
*  It's because ignoring the blind spots or just saying that it will be reduced in the
*  next future is generating a lot of difficulties and paradoxes that are literally impossible to
*  solve in the framework which is put by this ignorance.
*  And I can just read you a sentence by Erwin Schrödinger at the end of his book Nature
*  and the Greeks in which he puts the problem very nicely.
*  He said, okay, there is a feature less clearly and openly displayed,
*  but of equally fundamental importance.
*  It is this that science in its attempt to describe and understand nature
*  simplifies this very difficult problem.
*  The scientists subconsciously, almost inadvertently,
*  simplifies his problem of understanding nature by disregarding or cutting out
*  of the picture to be constructed himself, his own personality, namely the subject of cognizance.
*  Inadvertently, so here again it's the blind spot because it's inadvertently,
*  the thinker steps back into the role of an external observer.
*  This facilitates the task very much, but it leaves gaps, enormous lacunae,
*  leads to paradoxes and antinomies where whenever unaware of this initial renunciation,
*  one tries to find oneself in the picture or to put oneself,
*  one's own thinking and sensing mind back into the picture.
*  So you see that Schrödinger is alluding to paradoxes and the principle he identifies
*  for these paradoxes is trying to find yourself in the picture whereas you have withdrawn
*  from the picture in order to make the picture possible.
*  You want to make an objective picture of the world.
*  In order to do that, you withdraw from this picture and then you say,
*  oh, now I want to understand myself in this way, namely in the objectivist way,
*  and you fail because it's just impossible.
*  For instance, there is a list of examples.
*  The first example, of course, is the one Alex was mentioning,
*  namely you want to understand subjectivity in objective terms.
*  I intentionally put it that in this way in order for you to see the problem.
*  Or you want to explain the on-rise of consciousness from an objective process
*  that you describe, for instance, in the brain of someone,
*  and you forget that in order to describe this objective process,
*  you have had to withdraw with your own experience from the process you are describing,
*  and then you want to come back to this experience by a sort of strange loop, I would say,
*  trying to figure a sort of mirror of yourself and going back to where you started.
*  But this is impossible because you withdrew yourself with the most
*  characteristic feature of all, which is precisely that you are seeing but not seeing,
*  that you are understanding but not understood, and so on and so on.
*  And therefore, in this case, you have the famous heart problem that was
*  described and formulated nicely by David Chalmers.
*  But you have plenty of other cases which are exactly the same,
*  which have exactly the same origin. For instance, the measurement problem in quantum mechanics,
*  typically, is exactly the same origin. Not that you ignore your experience,
*  but that you ignore yourself as an agent, as for instance Christopher Fuchs would tell.
*  You are an agent trying to organize a certain experimental setup and predict
*  the result of your intervention and then perceiving the outcome of the experiment.
*  Okay, fine. But then you want to withdraw the agent from the process and say,
*  when does the event, the measurement outcome, occur?
*  Is it when a certain interaction between one particle and the first particle of the experimental
*  setup arises? Or is it when a certain complex thermodynamic process in the apparatus takes place?
*  Or is it when you observe it by your eyes? Or is it when you observe it by your eyes?
*  Or even by your consciousness? This problem has been raised
*  times and again and to my knowledge has never found a satisfactory answer.
*  Even though you find plenty of interesting answers, there is not one answer that satisfied everyone.
*  So the reason for that is precisely as a blind spot, namely that you withdrew from the process
*  what is the condition of possibility of the process, namely an embodied agent capable of
*  experience and of prediction. Since you have done that, you have extreme difficulties to recover
*  the so-called phenomenon that is observed in the laboratory. And this is one more example,
*  but I have a list of at least 10 examples, most of them from physics.
*  Yeah, so I was about to ask whether we should, or I think it would be useful actually to step back
*  because you both have a physics background and then, and Michel, for a long time now you've been
*  doing philosophy of science as well, a lot of it focused on physics. So by way of background,
*  I suppose, I'd love to know how you both came to appreciate phenomenology as an alternative
*  perspective or viewpoint to grapple with science in general. And then we'll get on to talking
*  about consciousness, but a lot of it, like Alex, did this creep up in your mind first in terms of
*  physics and quantum mechanics or was this after you transitioned to neuroscience,
*  how did you both come upon this as a, what seems to be a useful perspective?
*  I don't tend to have stories worthwhile being the introduction of a chapter as we read in all these
*  popular science books. Like when I was seven, I wondered, no, I was really naive and I studied
*  physics because I loved it, perhaps in search of invariants, but maybe that's a psychoanalytic
*  insight of mine. And I was happy doing pen and paper calculations and so on. Then by chance,
*  I got to work in this neuroscience lab, Mathieu-Louis in Barcelona. He was a portal for me
*  to make this transition, but he was really by chance. And there I am studying foot flies
*  and observing these little creatures making decisions and so on. And really nothing of what
*  I had learned from physics would work there. I mean, I was hired as a physicist. So, you know,
*  because I have a quantitative background that I could program and we think differently and so on.
*  So, okay, increases diversity and brings new tools. That's great. But then I started having
*  trouble just with these little creatures, the foot fly. So I would say my first step towards
*  phenomenology was coming across this notion, this word, the Umwelt, this German word, the Umwelt,
*  which encapsulates the idea of the recognition that the fruit flies and worms and so on,
*  they have their meaningful worlds, Welt in German means world. So they have this
*  meaningful environments. And Von Uxgel, who coined this concept, the zoologist, a century ago,
*  contrasted it with the physical surroundings. So I was puzzled. So here we have physical
*  surroundings. What we're good at measuring and thinking about physical chemistry stuff
*  around the maggot. But then he's saying these guys have their own meaningful worlds. And so
*  that was the first step. Okay, so they have it. So how are we going to possibly study it? Or at
*  least how are we going to honor it? Not just take it out of the picture, which has to do with the
*  blind spot, because I could say, who cares? I'm going to just imagine they're like cybernetic
*  robots. And you can still learn a lot thinking they're cybernetic robots for many reasons. And
*  you've had great, great scientists in your podcast talking about the inside out perspective and so
*  on, and the importance of action perceptual loops and so on. But in any case, the Umwelt
*  and biology was my first step. But then if you go to lab from life sciences to mind sciences,
*  because you may want to understand behavior or neurobiology, but I suspect many neuroscientists
*  get in neuroscience because they think, we think we're going to understand the mind, whatever that
*  is. And then I started realizing about the other member of the equation, which was myself. And
*  this inability to grasp other creatures, Umwelts, and also the problem that I had recognized from
*  physics to close the circle, that we practice very well this idea of a view from nowhere.
*  But it seemed that what was required was a view, a very concrete embodied view for the fruit fly
*  itself, and also the recognition that I was another creature studying the fruit fly. So it was slow
*  cooking. It wasn't like I had the realization. And I'm still, it's still ongoing. I'm still
*  discovering the many tricks that fool myself in this path. And I think now neuroscience,
*  just to say it again, what I said some minutes ago, I think now neuroscience of consciousness,
*  many people still hate it, but offers another opportunity, as Michelle was saying, to come
*  across this kind of dead end and then decide what we're going to do with the dead end. We're going
*  to say, no, give us more tools and money. We'll just dig a tunnel through the wall of this
*  one way street for instance, this dead end street, or we may actually go forward by pausing.
*  I call this the halting problem. We can talk about it later. Just pausing. Yes, let's pause and see
*  what the fuck is going on. Why aren't we making sense? Maybe examine if the questions we're posing
*  are correct or not. Forget about the answers. And then maybe go backwards. But this will lead us
*  into other topics which has to do with our notion of progress and so on, like always forward and
*  faster. But at least that just to say, I'm still puzzled by it. It's not that I've solved it or
*  I know it now. I'm constantly catching myself in that loop.
*  Michelle, did you have a, I think I remember you telling a story about you coming to some
*  realization through meditation. Do I remember that correctly?
*  Yes, but my interest for Phenology was much earlier than that. And so I had, for instance,
*  to come back to the time of my studies, when I was studying, in fact, medicine and physics,
*  but especially physics, I was absolutely fascinated by the working of the mathematics that
*  brought us amazing conclusions about the world. And yet, I was, you know, there was a little taste
*  of dissatisfaction because I thought, okay, this is fine. And this is beautiful. This is what I like,
*  really, to get through something that is really behind all the phenomena and all the appearances
*  to the reason for all the display. But I realized exactly what I was saying about Kant,
*  namely, all these things are made by our reasoning. It is our minds that are working in this
*  direction. It is our minds that are constructing, you know, a certain mathematical theory.
*  And from time to time, I was saying, okay, but let's come back to the concrete condition of that.
*  Let's come back to where I am now, at the moment where I am doing painful calculations on paper.
*  And I was more and more interested in this immediacy of the doings of someone who is
*  constructing a scientific thought. And one day I read Edmund Husserl. I was just 25,
*  and I read the Cartesian meditations of Edmund Husserl. And, you know, I read only the three first
*  pages, and I had an amazing experience. You know, Husserl was speaking of the famous
*  Husserl was speaking of the famous phenomenological reduction of the famous
*  epoch, namely bracketing, namely suspension of judgment, suspend any projection you can make
*  with your mind, and come back where you are at this very moment. And suddenly, I realized something,
*  I realized that all the, you know, the conception of the world I had was just a thought.
*  And I saw the thought, and I saw the appearances as if they were on the flat screen, you know,
*  no longer on in 3D, going through it and finding something behind it, just too deep. Okay, so
*  it was really a very strong experience, just reading a few pages of Husserl. Not everyone
*  is doing this experience, I must say, when reading Husserl. Some people think, oh, it's complicated,
*  abstract, and so on. In fact, it's not. It's just speaking of yourself at this very moment,
*  not anything else. So later, you know, much later, I had a very similar experience, which is maybe
*  even easier to explain and to tell you. It was in Finland, I was in a conference about the
*  foundations of quantum physics. And in a class with a blackboard, there was someone, I don't remember
*  who it was, maybe it was David Albert. And he wrote a long, long formula on the blackboard.
*  It was just quantum superposition, you know, a wave function or a state vector, which is written in
*  the form of a sum of terms. And this sum of terms is called a superposition. And then the guy said,
*  look, this is world one, in which the observer sees spin minus one half. And this is world two,
*  when the observer sees the spin plus one half. And you see the world, he says. And I was puzzled,
*  and I raised my arm and said, No, I don't see worlds. I see just white marks on the blackboard.
*  And you know, it was, it was a silly remark in some way. But it was my experience. My experience
*  was that our reason tends to go through itself to see something that is completely beyond any reach
*  for our usual intuition or our usual perception. And if we are a little bit lucid about that,
*  it's just a work of reason that can be written in the form of white marks on the blackboard.
*  And this is exactly you know, I think it's it's a process of phenomenological reduction,
*  suddenly you reduce all this extraordinary discourse about the world, or maybe the
*  multiverse to the fact that someone is saying that and someone is writing marks on a blackboard.
*  How did the instructor react to your comment slash question?
*  Oh, there was no it was puzzlement.
*  Something like deflation, sudden deflation of, you know, huge speculation towards a concrete,
*  flat, non interesting fact. But I think this, this remark, then pushed me to go
*  in a completely different direction. I no longer insisted in studying, for instance,
*  the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and went back to much more concrete,
*  much less speculative interpretations, of which one of the best example nowadays is quantum
*  bias in which the for instance, the state vector is nothing is no description of the world,
*  but it's just a tool that we use to bet about measurement outcomes. So here you come back,
*  you know, in the in the most trivial environment, you can think of namely, a laboratory with an
*  agent, someone who is trying to guess something to guess what will be the outcomes of the next
*  experiment. So it's very, very down to earth, you know. And I think this down to earth attitude
*  is typical of phenomenology. But phenomenology is even more than down to earth than that,
*  because you come back even earlier than than just, you know, gesturing in the laboratory,
*  in the experience you have of all that. So you come to the flattest possible world,
*  you can imagine, namely just here and now. But when you talk, it always sounds to me like a
*  contemplative state of mind. And that seems, well, seems incompatible with laboratory work.
*  I mean, I struggle with it myself. And I was also wondering how abstract what we're saying,
*  how does that sound to Paul? Because actually, we're trying to convey something which is the
*  opposite, which is concrete, and the immediate felt presence of experience and so on. But it
*  may sound super speculative. And I wonder whether people listening to this may say,
*  what are they talking about? And at the same time, I think we're trying to talk about
*  the very thing that's at reach. Right. So there's another contradiction there.
*  And I'm not sure we're doing it. Are we doing a good job? Or how does that sound for how do
*  you think this sounds for the very practical mind who's thinking about mechanisms and processes and
*  when we talk about phenomenology in this sense, what do you think?
*  Sorry, are you asking me or Michelle? Well, you, you, you as the similarly as
*  I've been swimming in your waters now for some time, and these concepts aren't new to me. So
*  I'm comfortable with the descriptions that seem well, still somewhat abstract, but I grasp onto
*  them as well. And this goes back to me saying how much of this is implicit in a scientist's
*  mind while they're working. And then you do the work anyway, because this, this comes back to
*  something I want to ask you both of how much the science changes with this perspective.
*  If you take this on board and, and contemplate it seriously, maybe that might be jumping the
*  gun a little bit in our conversation. I don't know if either of you wanted to add anything to that,
*  because I was going to go back and talk about maybe an example from quantum mechanics.
*  You just talked about the Bayesian aspect, Michelle, but, but this phenomenological
*  perspective changes and Michelle, you use a lot of examples in this and we don't need to go through
*  all the examples changes the interpretation of quantum mechanics. And namely, it switches it from
*  a view of what's real in the world to a view of what of probabilistic
*  measuring based on the mathematics. I don't know if you want to elaborate that more or if that
*  derails us in a direction we don't want to go. Yes, of course. Yes, indeed. When you, when you
*  adopt this attitude, you, you are back into the situation of a scientist who tries to
*  to orient himself or herself into a completely unknown landscape.
*  So it's when, you know, the problem of the beginning of quantum mechanics is that scientists,
*  especially physicists, had a prejudice about what they were exploring. But they saw that this
*  prejudice, namely that the world is made of particles having trajectories and, and, and
*  intrinsic properties that are modified across time, according to a certain law of nature and so on.
*  All of these prejudice could not be maintained against the, in the case of, of microphysics.
*  So they had to withdraw from that. And this withdrawal was already there at the very beginning
*  of quantum mechanics. When, for instance, when Heisenberg in 1925 said, I cannot maintain the
*  idea of a trajectory of an electron across space-time, namely around a nucleus of the atom.
*  And I have to come back to observables. And when he did that, he suddenly completely reformulated
*  quantum mechanics in terms of discrete values that could be directly observed. What, what were
*  these values? They were just the frequencies of a certain spectrum, an electromagnetic spectrum.
*  Okay. So according to Heisenberg, it was necessary to do this move in order to
*  find the next step of physics, namely the, what, what he calls, what he called for the first time
*  quantum mechanics at that time. Then there was, you know, discussion. For instance,
*  Schrodinger reformulated the same theory in terms of the famous wave mechanics.
*  And according to Schrodinger at that time, the wave function was describing a real wave out there.
*  And so apparently we came back from the very reflective attitude of Heisenberg to a
*  referential and realist attitude of Schrodinger. But then again, Schrodinger realized that the
*  wave function could not be said to describe a real wave out there, that it was in the 1950s,
*  he even said that it could be used only as a complex tool to calculate probabilities.
*  And there was a sort of, you know, cyclic movement in the interpretation of quantum mechanics,
*  in which from time to time people tried to rebuild a picture of the world out of quantum mechanics.
*  And from time to time, people withdrew from any picture of the world and say,
*  okay, I cannot draw a picture. And I just, I can just bet about what will be the reaction of what
*  I am exploring to the type of actions I'm doing. And then you have people like Chris Fuchs,
*  who tried to over speculate in order to find the reasons for which we cannot represent a world
*  independently of us. And we can only bet about the reaction of what we are exploring to our actions.
*  And he said, the reason might be that, you know, the world is so packed, that we cannot
*  disentangle ourselves from it. And therefore, we cannot get a picture, as if it were completely
*  external to us. So this attitude of withdrawing to the elementary actions and the movements of
*  our minds in a laboratory is maybe the indirect revelation of our situation of extreme implication
*  and entanglement with the world we are trying to explore. So there is something that can be
*  drawn from that, and which is not only deflationary, you know, you can do a sort of inflation of
*  speculation out of the necessity of deflation in order to understand quantum mechanics.
*  Now your question, Paul, is hard and it's very important. And I don't have a good answer,
*  because as much as I profess all of this, when it comes to how does that change what I actually do,
*  I still don't know. And it's really hard to put in terms of a protocol as in a methods section of a
*  paper. But what it does is kind of creates in me a strange feeling of ignorance, a new feeling of
*  ignorance. It's refreshing, but it's also daunting a little bit, because it's like there are these big
*  what ifs that suddenly appear to my life. What if physics is nested in biology? It's like, oh,
*  I always thought it was the other way around, but now I'm starting to entertain this seriously. And
*  that just turns everything upside down, that with respect to biology. But then when it comes to mind
*  or consciousness, well, we neuroscientists often ask how does the brain generate or produce
*  consciousness? But then I start asking whether it does. But this is a taboo question. And so then I
*  start looking for people with whom I can talk about those things within the scientific or
*  philosophical community. And that then leads me, it's like a treasure hunt, that leads me into
*  sort of archaeology of concepts. Like, if I really want to take this seriously, and nest physics in
*  biology, and even question that the brain is not producing consciousness, as if there was some sort
*  of smoke or epiphenomenon of a machine, then I need some theoretical guidelines. And so one starts
*  looking for them. I usually don't find them in the current literature. So one needs to go to dead
*  people often. If one is lucky, one comes across somebody like Michel, and I every now and then
*  ask him for a kind of private session, and so on. And then I realized, having started as a theoretical
*  physicist, and then jumped into the waters of experimental and computational neurobiology,
*  I find myself again being a kind of theoretical biologist, but not a theoretical biologist in
*  terms of simulating differential equations to model a phenomenon, which is great. But trying to
*  ask, well, what are the foundations of this new house? Because it's this realization, like, it's
*  not about refurnishing the living room or rearranging the kitchen. It's like, oh, the
*  foundations of this house that I was living in seem to be shaky, and therefore one must do something
*  about it. So that doesn't sound like very good news, but it's very exciting, because at the end
*  of the day, if the house falls, I'm not going to die. I mean, scientists, we don't have skin in the
*  game in that sense. And actually, this feeling of awe, one could say it's not even curiosity,
*  this feeling of awe is super energizing. I mean, there's so many different ways that we can go.
*  Maybe one way to move forward here, because since we're talking about, and I asked about
*  how this would actually affect doing science, so we could make the distinction between what I
*  understand and you guys can correct me between phenomenology, which is in the business of
*  describing our subjective experience, and science, which is supposedly in the business of explaining
*  and slash understanding. And so there is the question, which is directly related to how to
*  use this new perspective to move forward if you can. And Alex, you were just talking about how
*  this is a struggle for you. That's what I keep coming back to is, okay, let's say I buy in 100%.
*  What does that change about what I am doing in terms of trying to explain,
*  whether it's brain function and or embodied cognition and or some external, whatever
*  consciousness is, if it's a relation between body and brain and environment and so on.
*  Yeah. So is there a way to move forward, to join the descriptive aspect, if I explain that correctly,
*  if I, sorry, describe that correctly, and the explanatory push of science?
*  Well, I just quote Goethe here and then hand it on to Michel.
*  Dead people.
*  To do the work.
*  Dead people.
*  No, but he says something very provocative and beautiful. He says something like,
*  the phenomenon is itself the explanation. And the problem is that you should do proper
*  phenomenology. And perhaps here we should pause and make a distinction between the words phenomenon,
*  because phenomenon sounds second class in biology, right? Because mechanism travels in first class,
*  and phenomenon is that thing that you more or less are going to describe, account, and then nail down
*  with the mechanism. But phenomenology is not talking about phenomenon in that sense only,
*  as I understand it. So Goethe would say that, that if you can grasp, I mean, it all sounds
*  very romantic, I must admit. There are other ways of doing science. Maybe they didn't flourish
*  or were so popular throughout history. But this way of doing science where you get kind of a
*  direct perception, which is another taboo idea, into nature, right? You don't need to submit it
*  to the kind of Baconian, the Francis Bacon project of the new Atlantis 400 years ago. You don't need
*  to chain it in the lab and just force it to speed its secrets. It's like you can have a conversation
*  with it. So it's a more ecological sensibility. And I know all that sounds like blah, blah, blah,
*  but at least that's the promise that sure, you can and you should try to explain things
*  through mechanisms. But there's another understanding that's untapped, and that you
*  can practice whereby it's not only about what I call the M&Ms, manipulate and measure.
*  It's about new ways of perception even. I mean, I could also mention Rulof Steiner to add more
*  freaks to the list, but these are the compasses I tried to see. And again, Paul and Michelle,
*  I don't know to what extent these insights can be copied and pasted into current neuroscience.
*  I don't know if that's even possible. So I will not put it as an exercise where you first describe
*  and then you explain. Maybe these are parallel routes that can feed back from one to the other.
*  What do you have to say, Michel? Because I may be confusing things more here.
*  Well, maybe, you know, people think that, as you say, explanations in terms of mechanisms
*  is first class, namely, it's more fundamental, it's something deeper and so on than phenomena
*  by themselves. Yet, when you look at the history of science and the history of the concept of
*  explanation, you find that the concept of explanation has varied, has changed a lot across
*  history. And therefore, the phenomenologist could be interested in describing the way in which
*  something can convince you that it's a good explanation. So you see here that
*  phenomenology, in fact, is deeper than explanation because it shows what is the kind of feeling you
*  must have in order to be convinced by an explanation. Now, let's come to the history of explanations.
*  In Aristotelian times, an explanation was something very deep. You have to find
*  the ultimate cause of every process, the first cause, as Aristotel would say, and that was
*  interpreted by Christian interpreters of Aristotle as God. Or you had to find the essence
*  of things beyond the accidents, beyond the accidental appearances.
*  But then, this idea of finding the ultimate cause and the essence of things was very much
*  criticized from the 17th century onwards. For instance, René Descartes said, oh no, saying that
*  you can explain a certain phenomenon by the essence of things is just pure hand-waving.
*  We have to find spatial events that connect to each other in time and that connect to the process
*  you want to explain. This is called a mechanism. Mechanism comes from that, comes essentially
*  from René Descartes and also Robert Boyle. All these ideas that you have to find something like
*  cogs and wheels moving across space that explain by collisions the movement of something else.
*  This is the idea of mechanism. And then came Newton. For Newton, this kind of explanation was
*  no longer something that he thought was possible to reach at all. He said, in fact, what you have
*  to do is only one thing, is to connect phenomena by a mathematical law and nothing else. All the
*  rest is speculation. He called that hypothesis. In Latin, hypothesis non fingo, namely, I don't
*  conceive, I don't speculate about hypothesis about the mechanism of the world. I just connect
*  phenomena by a set of mathematical laws. From that point on, explanation, for instance, in
*  Hampel's terms was the so-called nomological deductive type, namely, you connect phenomena
*  by a mathematical law. If a phenomenon is connected to a former phenomenon by a mathematical law,
*  then you say it is explained. So the concept of explanation is changing. And we have to be aware
*  of this change. And I think in quantum mechanics, it's even worse, I would say. We don't explain
*  why a phenomenon follows another one because there is a famous indeterminacy. We just explain why
*  we are prone to predict this phenomenon by a certain probabilistic evaluation.
*  So we explain probabilities, we don't explain phenomena.
*  So the concept of explanation is to be explored and it is to be explored descriptively. We have to
*  describe how scientists explain. So description is deeper than explanation.
*  And let me add to this personal note. When I transitioned from physics to biology,
*  and I was in Rick Costa's lab with his bold generosity towards what I wanted to do there,
*  I constantly heard these words, necessity and sufficiency in lab meetings. Look, I was a PhD in
*  physics already. I never heard of them. You see, like the different species of humans that we
*  inhabit in a lab. And I was wondering, kind of like a person that goes to a remote island,
*  are they so concerned with this? And they started realizing, okay, this is the game here in neuro
*  biology. It's finding this necessity and sufficiency equals causality, equals explanation,
*  equals understanding. That's the formula. And there's some part of truth and benefit to it.
*  But then the intellectual feast is much greater because as Michelle was saying,
*  we have effective cause, but then there's also formal causes. Like what's Newton's law? F equals
*  M times A. That's not a mechanism. So again, I always live with this split mind because I go
*  back to when I was a physicist and I don't feel I'm ever really a biologist. So I realize, okay,
*  there are at least these two causes. Okay, final cause, people are so afraid. And so that was,
*  they got rid of it in the end of the 19th century. But then apart from causation, there are eight
*  causal principles. And this is not just mental masturbation. There's a little bit of it, but
*  these things have actual empirical consequences. And look, there's all these different ways of
*  explaining things or accounting for things. And we're only using one. We're only using a spoon.
*  And we're not willing to use a fork or a knife. That's one thing. And then the other thing that
*  I would add to this is that as scientists, we have always this kind of totalizing aspiration.
*  Like, okay, we explain these and then we explain that. And then we will explain that and that. And
*  ultimately we'll explain everything. It's like a sequence that pushes you and pushes you. But
*  how are you going to explain Bach? How are you going to explain a sunset? Again, it sounds very
*  romantic, but perhaps the best way to explain certain things is through literature, for instance.
*  Not to explain, but to grasp, to understand. It's through literature or through actual experience
*  with your partner or whatever. And so fine with explanation, but by two points to summarize,
*  there's a variety of flavors of explanation. They should all be pursued. And there's a moment where
*  science starts scratching, let's say, the realm of the humanities. And it's very arrogant to say,
*  look, we're going to use only the spoon and we can eat the whole world with the spoon.
*  Because there are all these places where I don't think what we really gained by saying, well,
*  this molecule accounts for what? For love, for depression, for joy? I mean, we learned something,
*  but is that really what we wanted to learn in the first place when we started this endeavor?
*  And so it's like an anabnesis, like, oh, that doesn't give me what I really wanted. It's something
*  to be valued. But again, there was kind of a promise at the beginning that we could understand
*  mind or life. And I just see that it becomes narrower and narrower and narrower. And we excel
*  at necessity and sufficiency in neuroscience. But then, again, the big questions remain
*  not just unanswered, but ill-posed. Okay, so this comes back to, so you use the word,
*  there was a promise in the beginning. And my worry is that and something I come back to in my own mind,
*  first of all, I think the phenomenological approach can be personally transforming, right,
*  and open your eyes to experience the world in a new light. That has nothing to do with my
*  science, though. And what I worry is that a lot of so whenever you create something like a podcast,
*  it's easy to tear it down and criticize it. Right. And that's much easier than creating something
*  anew. From what I glean, and this goes back to your halting problem, Alex. So far, the vast majority
*  of the work of a phenomenological perspective is to deconstruct rather than generate. And there's
*  a promise that it is going to generate. But as you're saying yourself, and you guys correct me
*  if I'm wrong, that promise, I'm not sure if it's gotten off the ground or am I misinterpreting?
*  I asked the same question to Michel a few weeks ago, actually. Like, I'm all for it. But where
*  I asked you, Michel, where do you see the future of phenomenology? And has it really failed? Or
*  did it take off? But what happened with it? So I'll ask you that too. Now.
*  Yes. Well, I think phenomenology cannot fail, because it's a permanent need of,
*  of, you know, human beings who is seeking knowledge. For instance, you were giving a good example,
*  Alex, that, well, you can, you can imagine someone who would say,
*  please teach me something about love. I want to know something about love. And then you can,
*  you know, as a scientist, you would say, okay, love is about a citizen, or love is about, you know,
*  hormones, and so on. And so you have the feeling that you have told this person something about
*  love. Now, this, this person might be a little bit puzzled by your answer, because maybe it was not
*  exactly the kind of answer he or she was expecting. And then you, you, you offer her a novel,
*  a novel about a love story. And then this person reads the book, and comes across the situations
*  that are described by the, by the novel, and feels emotions by herself, feels emotion that are
*  triggered by the description, and that, so to speak, simulates the characters of the novel.
*  And then the person, this person could say, oh, now I have learned something important about love.
*  Why? Because she has gone through the type of emotions that are typical of love. So, you see
*  that there are here two types of knowledge. The knowledge by distancing, observing, manipulating,
*  and the knowledge by acting, by being, by going through, by being implied. And this, this kind of
*  knowledge is the, I would say the primary knowledge, because in order to get the second
*  type of knowledge, the objectifying knowledge, you have to be implied somewhere. You have to be
*  enthusiastic about science. You have to be happy about discovering something about the world.
*  So, the initial type of knowledge is knowledge by implication, by self-commitment, by commitment,
*  by being committed to something. So, in this, if this is true, then phenomenology cannot be
*  a sort of old-fashioned subject, because it's exactly about commitment. It's about going through
*  all these states and perhaps trying to describe them to other people in order for them to share
*  some of this lived knowledge. So, phenomenology is at the same time, you know, a strange knowledge,
*  because people tend to go through it without really paying attention to it. They tend to
*  to forget it. And at the same time, it's absolutely crucial, because it's where you
*  stand at this very moment, and that you necessarily need it.
*  I see, Paul, I see, Paul, when I think I see where your question is coming from, and I also share
*  the feeling that when, at least I'll talk to, I'll talk about myself, when I say you're right about
*  these things. And some colleagues of mine tell me, like, this sounds very destructive,
*  but what do you bring forth? John Cracauer does this to me all the time. I appreciate it, you know,
*  his kind of sweetly sharp remarks, like, that's great, but what are you going to bring to the
*  table? And often I don't know what I'm going to bring to the table, but I think this effort of
*  cleaning up some mess can be positive, even though it looks negative. And another thing, if I can use
*  a metaphor, it's not really about, it's even not about getting rid of stuff. It's the opposite.
*  Like, I think we have this kind of monoculture. Imagine like a vast field of genetically modified
*  corn, you know, acres and acres and acres of necessity and sufficiency. And we're just saying,
*  well, perhaps you could have other things planted here, if the weather allows, and flowers and maybe
*  insects pollinizing and so on. So actually, it's to go from a monoculture to something that's
*  richer and also with respect to concepts and theoretical biology. It's also about
*  enlarging the kind of the mind space, having more, even more metaphors, for instance,
*  more metaphors to think about the brain and a wider range, the role of imagination in science
*  and so on. So yes, it has a side that looks like tearing apart things that I admit I didn't build.
*  So it may sound easy, like, oh, here comes the new kid and just criticizes the city, but it's also
*  an invitation, I would say, to a richer and more plural way of thinking and doing
*  experiments. And in that sense, back to Unfeld, the moment you realize what Unfeld means,
*  even if you apply a cybernetic approach, then behavior, let me say something concrete, at least
*  I hope it's concrete. I think you gain by studying behavior empirically, because you don't see
*  behavior, animal behavior, for instance, as the outputs of organisms, what the mouse did,
*  but what the mouse is trying to perceive, it's, you know, behavior, this idea of behavior as the
*  control of perception. And that's still far, far away from granting them subjective experience or
*  consciousness. But now, because you have this animal-centric perspective, I think you can
*  do better research. So that's something tangible. And now in consciousness studies, I know many
*  people are critical of integrated information theory, but look what happens when you start your
*  theory of consciousness from phenomenology. And as far as I know, it's virtually the only modern
*  attempt to do that. All the rest start with what I say, like a metaphor turned into mathematics,
*  and then with some covert metaphysics, they all start from abstraction. So what I'm saying is
*  they're concrete examples of trying to implement that phenomenological path. And one can see,
*  whether one agrees or not, it's a different thing, or it has to be tested and so on.
*  But they're concrete fruits along the way. And again, I think it's a more joyful trip than kind
*  of a train crossing this gray monoculture that can, I mean, you may love eating corn, but come on,
*  not for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, knowing that we live in Spain and we have jamon and tortilla.
*  So that's, that's what I'm trying to say.
*  Yeah.
*  Michel, did you want to add something?
*  Yes. Also, of course, I can bring the issue of neurophenomenology in this discussion because
*  from the very beginning of the discipline of neurobiology, the issue was not only to find
*  about the anatomy and physiology of the brain, it was also to find about the functions of the brain.
*  And the functions of the brain were supposed to have something to do with the mind. So how can you
*  find the mental functions of parts of the brain, if not by asking people what they feel or what they
*  experience when they have this area of the brain cut off or when they have this area of the brain
*  stimulated. So the, you know, the input of, say, cognitive psychology and other disciplines that try to
*  make some sense of what people do and live in their experience is absolutely crucial for
*  neurobiology. It's not something that can be neglected. And the idea of the idea of neurophenomenology
*  was just an amplification of this method that has been used since the very beginning of neurobiology,
*  namely, okay, since you use to ask people what they experience when they have such a brain area
*  stimulated or cut off, then try to ask them in a very detailed way, the same kind of detailed way as
*  phenomenology is using in its description of lived experiences.
*  But when so I'm sorry, this is a very simplistic or naive notion that has been defended in neurophenomenology,
*  but isn't that subject to the same constraints of the phenomenological viewpoint? When I ask someone
*  and they tell me something, never mind whether they're confabulating or their language isn't up to par
*  to communicate that it's my experience of it that is foremost and the third person objective experience
*  of scientific endeavor still fails to then there's still a primary failure of phenomenology.
*  There's still a primary phenomenology that cannot be overcome because it is my subjective experience.
*  So it's the same thing as when you look at a brain. It's no more than your perception. Well,
*  your subjective experience is primary of the brain. And so, not to belabor the point, but Alex,
*  I think if I was still running a neuroscience lab, this in some sense would stop me.
*  You said it invigorates you. In some sense, it would stop me wanting to proceed with my
*  experiments because every experiment would then be subject to be interpreted as my subjective
*  experience of measuring those observables. And so I wouldn't feel as though I was actually moving
*  forward in explanation and understanding, even though I know we have already covered those topics.
*  Yes, I don't think we're advocating for subjectivism. This is not a form of subjectivism.
*  I'm not saying you're saying that, but just to be aware in the same way that you could say like
*  Einstein relativity is not about relativism. We're not talking about everything goes or like
*  let's see what people have to say. But at the same time, we're saying in the same way that you look,
*  we spend so much money and so much engineers and funding agencies to build better measurement tools.
*  I think what Michelle and I tried to convey here is that there's also scope and to build better
*  observation tools, which is precisely us and observation of our own experiences. And I think
*  that's where neurophenomenology comes into play. Imagine we could have, well,
*  Christoph Koch calls it the mind scope, right? Well, it's really a brain scope, but imagine we
*  also had a mind scope and now we put them together and then we ask the brain scope,
*  what do we see with the brain scope and what do we see with the mind scope? And then each other
*  constrains the other. So it's a dance and it's a difficult dance between first person and third
*  person because they seem they're built to kind of annihilate each other. But there's this feeling
*  that, well, we tried introspection in the 19th century and it failed. And so come on, and gut
*  feeling. And also there's this propaganda. Let me say it this way, like our senses constantly
*  deceive us and we should just distrust anything that has to do with our own experience. Well,
*  yes and no, because at the end of the day, abstractions are equally dangerous, if not more.
*  So I don't want to lay down this as if it was a battle and see whether first person or third
*  person wins or mechanism or description wins. Again, it's like there's this huge field that's
*  not very explored or exploited that has to do with taking first person experience more seriously.
*  Now in physics, if you're starting throwing stones or electromagnetism, I guess you could do
*  away without that for decades or centuries. It was only when, as I understand, when we went to look
*  at these kind of micro energetic scales of quantum mechanics or these really, really like there,
*  there we kind of come, then we realized like in Truman's show, like when he's swimming with
*  the boat, it's like, oh, swim, swim and then rowing, sorry. And then he discovers there are
*  these painted walls, right? That's the sky. So that in a way happened in physics. Now, again,
*  when we do biology and psychology and neuroscience, if we really want to understand the mind and
*  consciousness, I think these kind of paradoxes come across more vigorously and sooner.
*  And then we are perplexed and the usual way forward is the way forward is more technology,
*  more resolution, more connectomics, more big data and so on. And I'm not saying let's not do that.
*  I'm saying what about the other thing? Perhaps it's more needed than ever before. And this dance,
*  and just one more thought here and very coarse, but like the foundations of science 400 years ago,
*  what about this business of saying, well, let's concentrate on these first, which is what we can
*  make sense of objectively. And let's postpone that other thing for later. But then the later
*  never arrives, but it keeps up popping again. And that's what phenomenology tries to bring to the
*  table. The fact that the subjective aspect, it's always going to be there. It's always going to be
*  popping its head and we can just kind of bang it again, but it will pop up somewhere else.
*  And so we better take it more seriously and embrace it. It's not a nuisance. It's not noise
*  to get rid of. It's a treasure. I think it's fascinating. And it connects us again.
*  It connects us with being a human being. Like you're saying before, Paul, that something like,
*  well, when I'm at work in the lab, I want to do some things. And then maybe later,
*  well, you weren't saying that, but something of the sort of when it's time to do experiments,
*  let's do it. And then maybe we can think about those. But it's hard for me to live in this kind
*  of split mind where when we have a pet at home, but then we sacrifice animals in the lab routinely,
*  it's very strange. Or when we look for mechanisms in the lab, but then in the weekend, we look
*  at children play and we wonder about love and joy. We live within a split mind. And
*  I'm rambling here, but what's the future of science? I wonder, is it a future where it becomes
*  more and more technical, more and more technological and less and less disembodied and less and less
*  human in a way, which is some of the topics that you explore brilliantly in your podcast with
*  respect to AI. Is that the future of science that's coming? Is that the future of science
*  that we want? Or we can recover kind of the human aspect and insert it in science and still
*  have the enterprise working. I don't know if it's orthogonal, but to what you were just saying,
*  Alex, but a while back you mentioned and Michelle described when you read a passage in a novel,
*  let's say, and Alex, you made the push. Of course, there's a modern, I don't know if it's
*  fringe push to connect science and humanities, but there's a lot of people saying, well, we need to
*  look at novels because that is how you understand in this example, love. However, I inherently
*  distrust language. Of course, language is one of the crucial factors that makes humans so,
*  successful and for us to be able to communicate. I know that my own language, I'm not thinking
*  about what I'm saying before I'm saying it. It's sort of tumbling out of my mouth and through some
*  subconscious process, but everything that we've been, the podcast is based on language and
*  everything we've been communicating is language. A lot of the phenomenology descriptions are based
*  on language. Of course, there can be a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding
*  about the terms that we use, but somehow love is still communicated, to go back to that example.
*  I'm wondering if you see language as a barrier or since I mistrust language as the best way to
*  describe and yet language is necessary for phenomenological descriptions, unless we go back
*  to mathematical equations, which seems antithetical to the phenomenological approach.
*  I'm just wondering how you see language interacting or where you situate language.
*  In fact, I would like to quote a very short sentence by Wittgenstein in his book, Uncertainty.
*  He says, doubt presupposes certainty. You cannot doubt everything because in that case,
*  you would even doubt what you are saying about doubt. You cannot doubt all of your lived
*  experience because if it were the case, you would also doubt the conviction you have that
*  experience is unreliable. There is a sort of feedback loop in this case. You have to rely on
*  something. You have to rely on your present conviction or you have to rely on the faithfulness
*  of language to convey your thoughts or emotions and so on. Then when you have done this work of
*  trust, then distrust can come, but only secondarily as a way to discriminate between what can be
*  trusted and what cannot be trusted. Universal distrust is impossible because you would not even
*  trust your distrust in this case. What about language? I think language has many functions.
*  The function of making descriptions, making references to things that are objectified
*  and that you want to convey to other people, what you want to convey to other people is the following
*  idea. If you do the same as I am doing now, then you will see something that is similar to what I am
*  saying. This is exactly what you want to say. In phenomenology, language has a very different use.
*  You don't refer to something that everyone can see, but you try to take people back to where they are.
*  It's almost paradoxical. Usually in language, when you evoke something, you want to push someone
*  far from where he or she is doing now. For instance, when you say,
*  please think of a rose. This rose is not present. And yet, when you are pronouncing the word rose,
*  you are suddenly evoking something that is far away and that the person can evoke in her mind.
*  When you try to make a phenomenological description, the process is the other way around.
*  You don't want to push someone far from where she stands, but you want to bring back this person
*  in the very situation in which she is at this very moment and suddenly recognize in your words
*  something she is living at the very moment in which she is reading you. It's something exceptional.
*  The usual use of language is completely different from this one. But this is an alternative use of
*  language, which is very interesting because it's an alternative and which can be added to the
*  functions of language which were listed by John Austin, for instance, namely the
*  locutionary and parlocutionary functions, namely the function of referring to something that can be
*  seen, the function of doing things with words, namely for instance when I tell you, here is
*  money. You don't know that this is money, but because I have said that, you can recognize this
*  piece of paper as money. This is the locutionary. And also there is the parlocutionary, namely
*  showing someone what she should do in order to satisfy your expression that you are emitting at
*  this very moment. For instance, if I ask you, please, can you bring me a piece of paper and
*  a pencil? Then I use language to invite you to do something for me. This is the famous parlocutionary
*  function of language. Now, what I described, the language of phenomenology is a fourth type
*  with respect to these three types. I call it auto or self-locutionary because it brings you back
*  where you are. I do not tell you, fetch me a pencil. I do not tell you this is a piece of money,
*  but I tell you, realize where you are now at this very moment. Realize the flavor of what you are
*  feeling. Realize the taste of the sounds of my words and so on and so on. I want to bring back
*  where you are instead of pushing you far from where you are. This is why I call this function
*  of language, which is typical of phenomenology, the self-locutionary function.
*  Let me finish then with this question, but I know that any question I ask could
*  take a long time. You both have a background in the hard third-person objective sciences
*  and you have come to appreciate the phenomenological approach. I am wondering,
*  to what degree you ascribe your developed appreciation for phenomenology. I am wondering
*  what role that original, I do not know what is original when we come out of the womb, but our
*  original training for third-person objective science, is that necessary to truly appreciate
*  the phenomenological aspect and do they serve as mutual constraints in your minds?
*  What role does that, for lack of a better term, original third-person objective science play?
*  Well, one needs to unlearn it or unlearn the other skill. At least that is how I feel about it.
*  It is not that you learn and you forget the objective method, but it is like another sport
*  that uses your leg in a different way. It takes some time and then I am not sure whether you are
*  so good at practicing both. I am not sure it actually learns, but maybe if I can use kind of
*  a hard analogy, it would be like one person doing drugs for a long time and then being able
*  to appreciate much better what it is not to drink. Even allowing oneself to drink or take psychedelic
*  substances from time to time, it is like the ability to switch from one part to the other.
*  Being well immersed and even a true believer in the view from nowhere, at least in my case,
*  allows me to appreciate much better what this phenomenological approach is offering,
*  but not rejecting. I want to convey also an integrative vision, not rejecting or dismissing
*  the view from nowhere, but just like a tool, being more mindful as to where it can be used and why
*  and when it fails and what can one do about it. Yes, I entirely agree with Alex actually.
*  I think that in a society in which the extreme objectification, that is the condition of
*  possibility of science, would not have been invented and imposed on many communities of
*  workers and thinkers, then phenomenology would have been a matter of course. It would not even
*  have been a special issue, a special topic, a special philosophical discipline and so on.
*  It would have been just life, ordinary life. But in a civilization in which objectification has
*  become a value, in which it has sometimes claimed exclusivity for itself, phenomenology can be a
*  compensation or just a counterweight, a necessary counterweight, not to challenge the necessity of
*  objectification, but to complete it, to complete it with its very background
*  condition of possibility, the famous blind spot we were speaking of before. The thing that we
*  no longer see when we see too much the objective side of appearances. And so phenomenology is a
*  cure to the excess of objectification. It's also a counterweight. It's also an exercise, as Alex
*  told us, it's an exercise of mindfulness. We just have to be mindful about where we started
*  the inquiry, where we tried to begin something that was objectification. Objectification is a
*  process that was imposed on our minds and therefore we have to be clear about where it started from
*  and what is its source. And its source is in experience. And I think the second ingredient,
*  an ingredient that is also an experience, is desire. Desire for something more than we have
*  at this very moment. Desire for understanding, desire for possession, desire for everything that
*  is beyond us. But here again, there must be an antidote to an excess of desire and phenomenology
*  can be this antidote. Paul, there is a converse version of your question, which is in a way,
*  I'm sorry, I feel I'm taking the role of the interview, but we said that wasn't an interview,
*  that's more a conversation. But we could also ask, is it important to what extent learning
*  first-person perspective first can be revealing or insightful about the objective approach? And
*  there is a real world experiment running right now, I would say, led by His Holiness the Dalai Lama,
*  whom as I understand is having Buddhist monks, like the real deal, the real Buddhist monks,
*  not mindfulness from six to seven on Tuesdays, but the real deal, have them also be fluent
*  with the scientific approach. And so I'm very curious to see what that leads to in terms of
*  new insights and new ways of doing science, because this is the other way around.
*  So whatever, it's a very interesting cross-pollinization that can take place in both
*  directions. Well, guys, this has been a very pleasant experience for me, and I desire that
*  we do it again sometime, or at least that you have great evenings and continue to live great lives.
*  So thanks for taking the time. And I'm sorry, we didn't get to 200 other questions.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you so much for doing this, Paul. I really like listening to your episodes. And I think
*  you're doing a great service to the neuroscience community writ large, because, well, now it's more
*  popular to have these forums, but we need arenas where these ideas can be aired beyond the lab
*  meetings and laboratory discussions. And I think you're doing a great service to neuroscience.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks, Alex.
