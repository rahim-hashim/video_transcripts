# BI 145 James Woodward: Causation With a Human Face
**Brain Inspired:** [August 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzasAbrkxNg)
*  The basic interventionist notion of causation, I think, is a very kind of weak or minimal
*  notion.
*  All that it really involves is the idea that there's some way of wiggling the candidate
*  cause such that the candidate effect will change.
*  Well obviously, in many, many contexts, you want to know a lot more than that.
*  I just want to say if you're a philosopher or even someone in another discipline, this
*  whole complex of questions and issues is a really kind of fruitful and interesting place
*  to be from my point of view.
*  In my own case, the reason why I went into philosophy to begin with was I thought that
*  it kind of gave me a license to stick my nose into all sorts of different things.
*  And that's what I've done in my career and I found it unbalanced very, very, very satisfying.
*  The nature of causality and causal explanation has occupied philosophers since there were
*  philosophers.
*  What does it mean when some thing or event or process causes some effect?
*  Hello everyone, I'm Paul and my guest today is James Woodward, who's a recently retired
*  professor from the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of
*  Pittsburgh.
*  Jim has written extensively not about what causation is per se, but about what causation
*  does.
*  He begins with a minimal notion of causality, often called interventionism, which is simply
*  the idea that if you were to intervene on a cause or wiggle the cause, as Jim sometimes
*  says, then it would make a difference to the effect.
*  From that simple notion, things quickly get more complicated with questions about how
*  reliable a cause is, how many different ways we can explore a cause, how to treat causes
*  effects at different levels of granularity, how much of some single cause we can attribute
*  to an effect with multiple causes, and so on.
*  Much of that work was done in Jim's 2003 book, Making Things Happen, a Theory of Causal
*  Explanation.
*  And in his most recent book, Causation with a Human Face, he uses the interventionist
*  framework of causality to expand on those ideas and in particular to explore the relationship
*  between how we should think about causality, making claims about causality under the interventionist
*  framework, and how we humans actually do think about causality, how we make judgments about
*  and reason about causality in the world, our causal cognition.
*  For Jim, these usually separate lines of research have a lot to teach each other.
*  So we discuss those ideas, some of the other major and minor themes in the new book, and
*  of course much more.
*  In the show notes, I link to both books that I mentioned.
*  Find them at braininspired.co.
*  slash podcast slash 145.
*  To my Patreon supporters and students in my neuro AI course, I salute you for your support
*  and generosity.
*  I recognize it's not the default to take action to support a podcast, and I feel a deep gratitude
*  to you.
*  Thank you.
*  Here's Jim.
*  Jim, welcome back, old friend.
*  Well, thank you, sir.
*  I say old friend, of course, because this is actually take two of our attempt at recording
*  a podcast episode due to yours truly's, what's a euphemism, challenge, ongoing challenges
*  as a podcast creator, perhaps.
*  So I really appreciate you doing this again.
*  And we won't repeat verbatim what we did last time, but we'll see.
*  Okay, sounds great.
*  So your new book, Causation with a Human Face, follows almost a decade after your, what I
*  would call now classic book, Making Things Happen.
*  And in some sense, the new book, Causation with a Human Face, is a continuation or an
*  expansion of what you did in making things happen.
*  So in making things happen, you introduced your interventionist framework for approaching
*  causation, and you revisit that in Causation with a Human Face.
*  But then you go on to do things that you alluded to, at least, and did a little bit in making
*  things happen, where you take this functional perspective, functionalist perspective on
*  causation.
*  And in that regard, you focus on connecting an account of causation itself, what causation,
*  is, with how we do causation, something called causal cognition, how we make judgments about
*  causation and reason about causation in the world.
*  Could you elaborate, maybe, you know, we're going to have to talk about what interventionist,
*  the interventionist, we're going to have to talk about what the interventionist approach
*  is, but maybe before that, can you elaborate on this functionalist approach and why you
*  chose it, why you think it's an important way to proceed?
*  Be happy to do that.
*  So to begin with, the functionalist approach, it's just the idea that we think causally,
*  we engage in causal reasoning because it's useful for us.
*  In other words, causal thinking is functional.
*  And I claim that that imposes various kinds of constraints on how we as philosophers or
*  inquiry, inquiries in general, should think about causation.
*  So that's the basic picture of the functional aspect of causation.
*  You alluded to the idea that my view is an interventionist view, and that's right.
*  It's a view that connects causal claims with claims about what would happen if you were
*  to get in there and manipulate things.
*  So if C causes E, then if you manipulate C in the right way or you intervene on C in
*  the right way, then E will change.
*  And that's at least an important part of my story about the functionality of causation.
*  Causal knowledge is functional for us because it encodes information that we can use to
*  manipulate and control.
*  So I know that there are other people that have this kind of functionalist approach like
*  Udaya Pearl and so on who've been working on this, but the history of the philosophy
*  of causation hasn't really followed that so much.
*  It's been much more concerned with sort of the metaphysical what causation is part of
*  the question, going back to Hume and of course, Aristotle and all those good old
*  philosophers. But you allude to this a little bit in making things happen as well, but you
*  spend more time on it in your recent book on the difference between epistemology and
*  metaphysics and why you think that there shouldn't be necessarily such a difference.
*  And in my view, you almost it could be interpreted as if you say, well, as if it's you
*  saying, well, I don't really want to talk about metaphysics because it's not important.
*  But at the same time, you're kind of saying they should be talked about in the same vein.
*  So why do you hate metaphysics?
*  What's that about?
*  I don't know that I would say that I hate metaphysics.
*  But what I do think is this and I try to say this clearly in the book that the pursuit
*  of an inquiry into the so-called metaphysics of causation that completely neglects the
*  epistemology or the methodology of how we find out about causal relationships is not
*  going to be very fruitful.
*  And I think there is at least some tendency in people who work on the analytical
*  metaphysics of causation to completely neglect the epistemological side of things.
*  So in other words, the idea is that metaphysics is one thing.
*  Epistemology is something completely different.
*  It's a consequence of my functional way of thinking about causation that those two
*  things, epistemology and metaphysics, are completely different.
*  And so those two things, epistemology and metaphysics, should not be taken as
*  completely separate because, according to me, we're interested in causal relations
*  because this is useful information for us.
*  And that means that we have to be thinking about causation in such a way that there are
*  ways of finding out whether causal relationships in the world obtain or not.
*  From the functionalist point of view, it's a kind of constraint on any adequate theory
*  of causation that it should link up with the procedures that we actually have for
*  finding out which causal relationships obtain in the world.
*  So metaphysics not useless, but perhaps less useful for the way we actually do
*  causation in the world.
*  Well, what I do think is, so from my point of view, there are kind of two projects
*  associated with causation or causal reasoning that I find interesting.
*  One, as I say in the book, is a normative project.
*  How should we think or reason causally?
*  And you find this normative aspect of things certainly addressed in the
*  philosophical literature, but also in literature on machine learning, where
*  there's a lot of interest in how you can learn about causal relationships from, for
*  example, observational data.
*  There's a forging tradition in statistics and econometrics that is also normative.
*  So what I hope is that the book makes some contribution to those kinds of
*  normative concerns.
*  I think that's a completely valuable and interesting project.
*  And then the other issue, which I find intellectually very interesting, is how, in
*  fact, do we do it as a descriptive matter?
*  How is it that people think causally and how is it that when they think causally, at
*  least to some substantial amount of time, they're successful in identifying causal
*  relationships?
*  So I guess it would be a fair thing to say about the book, that it focuses on
*  those two projects, what I call the normative and descriptive, and shall we
*  say is at least kind of quietest about what the underlying metaphysical story is.
*  And that quietism is completely intentional.
*  It's not that it doesn't occur to me that some people out there think that one
*  should provide a metaphysical story.
*  I deliberately refrain from trying to provide one, at least of any very
*  elaborate sort.
*  Well, I mean, being quiet can be pretty loud.
*  So have you received pushback from the metaphysicians out there that you're not
*  paying enough attention or doing enough service toward metaphysics?
*  We're not going to harp on metaphysics for long, I promise.
*  OK, well, good.
*  But yeah, certainly.
*  And even in connection with the first book, it was a kind of ongoing complaint
*  that I really hadn't provided an underlying metaphysics of causation.
*  So, for example, I talk about what would happen to one variable if you intervene
*  and change the value of another.
*  But people have said to me, well, OK, but what are the truth makers for those
*  claims about what would happen if you were to intervene?
*  You know, what's the underlying story about, you know, what's going on at a
*  metaphysical level?
*  Are you committed to powers or dispositions as your account of causation or maybe
*  relations of necessitation between universals or maybe something else?
*  And I have to say that I just don't find
*  the focus on those kinds of issues.
*  And there's certainly a lot of it in the metaphysics of causation literature.
*  I just don't think it's been fruitful in comparison with these other kinds of
*  issues, both the normative ones and the descriptive ones about how, in fact, we
*  do it, where it seems to me there's been a lot of really recognizable progress
*  made. We've learned a lot of new things there.
*  And I don't think that there's been, frankly, anything that is comparable in
*  the analytical metaphysics of causation.
*  You use the word fruitful there, which I believe you use in the book as well.
*  And that is part of the functionalist approach.
*  And I think that, you know, maybe that's one reason why, at least from my
*  perspective in the neuroscience world and I guess in the biological world, a lot of
*  people have really embraced this interventionist brand of causation
*  because it lends itself well to actual experimentation.
*  I know it doesn't require an experiment because you can infer causation from
*  observable data as well.
*  So maybe just in terms of another background to your approach, you
*  mentioned earlier that people often are causally correct or fruitful in
*  their causal judgments.
*  And this has to do with the rational approach that you also take in thinking
*  that there's a normative aspect there where people are rationally approaching
*  judgments of causation.
*  I don't know if you have more to say about that.
*  I'm not sure I have a question.
*  I just wanted to make sure we got that out there because I guess on the other
*  side of the coin, there are a lot of people who focus on our foibles.
*  I'm part of that group.
*  I think I go both ways, but you're more focused on the rational, fruitful, correct
*  judgments of causation, right?
*  That's true. That's true.
*  So just to say a little bit more about that, I said a moment ago that I was
*  interested both in normative issues about how we ought to reason causally and
*  descriptive issues about how we in fact do.
*  But I see these as closely interconnected in just the way that you describe.
*  That is, I think it's true and I realize this is controversial, but I think it's
*  true as a matter of empirical fact that at least a substantial amount of the time
*  people do reason in normatively appropriate ways.
*  And so looking at normative models of a cognitive cognition often is useful in
*  answering descriptive questions about how people in fact reason causally.
*  This perspective is certainly not unique or original with me.
*  I think it's very widely adopted in the causal cognition literature, where at least
*  a whole lot of the people working in this area, psychologists and cognitive
*  scientists, do tend to assume some sort of rational model picture of of
*  causal cognition.
*  Now, I realize that this stands in contrast to another tradition in
*  psychology, which focuses much more on the mistakes we make, our biases,
*  et cetera, et cetera.
*  I guess I just find it more interesting somehow and more more worthwhile.
*  And maybe at some level kind of more respectful to human subjects in these
*  experiments, if we try to understand to what extent what they're doing may may
*  turn out to be rational or normatively appropriate.
*  And I mentioned in the book several cases in which people engage in certain
*  patterns of causal reasoning.
*  The initial reaction was, oh, this shows that people are being irrational or
*  acting in normatively inappropriate ways.
*  And then we've come to realize that actually, no, it was the normative
*  analysis that was wrong.
*  If we kind of think in a kind of deeper and more sophisticated way about what's
*  normatively appropriate, it turns out, at least in some range of cases, that their
*  cognition is rational after all.
*  Can I put you on the spot and have you describe one of those examples?
*  Maybe your favorite example of that.
*  OK, so so there's a measure of what's called causal strength.
*  So a lot of a lot of the psychological literature makes use of subjects'
*  judgment of what's called causal strength, where this course, the subjects
*  response to something like the question, how good of a cause would you say that C
*  is for E?
*  So this is the experimental data that at least some psychologists try to try to
*  fit a simple measure of.
*  That you might think is the normatively correct one when you have two just two
*  binary events, a cause C that can take one of two values on or off and an effect E
*  that can take one or two values on or off.
*  You might think that the normatively appropriate judgment of causal strength to
*  make in that case is just to take the conditional probability of the effect in
*  the presence of the cause and subtract from that what the conditional probability of
*  the effect would be in the absence of the cause.
*  This is called Delta P.
*  And people noticed when they did these look at this issue experimentally, that subjects
*  weren't always judging in accordance with Delta P.
*  And it turns out that there's a very good normative reason why they don't do that.
*  And I won't go into a lot of details, but it's laid out very clearly in, for example,
*  work that Patricia Chang at UCLA has done.
*  And the basic problem is that if you're just focusing on Delta P, you're not adequately
*  or appropriately controlling for the possibility that there may be other causes of
*  E present besides C.
*  So Chang has a somewhat more complicated measure, which tracks, at least in some
*  respects, causal strength judgments that subjects make much better than the naive
*  Delta P does.
*  So that's just one example I can give you a number of others if you're interested.
*  Yeah, well, you use a lot of examples in the book.
*  I mean, obviously, we're not going to go through all of them, but I just thought it'd
*  be useful as we go along to maybe visit some of the examples about the various topics
*  in the book. So let's see, where do we go from here?
*  Maybe let's back up for a moment because, well, you know what?
*  Let's not back up. This is a terribly unfair question.
*  But just in a broad sense, and you've been talking about this a little bit already.
*  What is the relationship between the normative and the normative and the descriptive?
*  How do we broadly judge causal reasoning?
*  I mean, is your rational perspective, has it borne out to a successful
*  so that such that you think it's a successful and oh, how do I put this has championed
*  your rational approach?
*  Have the results from cognitive sciences championed the rational approach?
*  Like, how do you broad? You know, what's the big conclusion?
*  Because you go through a lot of examples in the book.
*  What's the big conclusion about how we judge and reason causality?
*  So I think the question you're asked or one question you're asking is, how do we tell
*  whether a normative proposal about reasoning is is correct or appropriate?
*  Is that that's yes. Yeah.
*  So my answer to that is is a kind of means and
*  type answer. That is, we we specify some goal,
*  what it is that we want to learn or figure out about.
*  And typically in this sort of context, this will be learning about some
*  particular kind of causal concept.
*  One of the themes of the book is that there are a whole variety of different.
*  Yeah, I want to come to that concept.
*  So one of the things you need to do is to just specify clearly
*  right at the beginning what what concept it is that you are interested in.
*  I think of all of the causal concepts as connected in one way or another
*  to issues about what would happen under interventions.
*  But the connections are different in different cases.
*  So suppose I say that, you know, what I want to learn is whether if I were to
*  perform an intervention on C, he would change.
*  So that's my goal.
*  Then there are a variety of different ways in which I might try to answer
*  that question, depending upon the kind of data that I have available to me.
*  If I can actually do an experiment in which I manipulate C and see what happens
*  to you, OK, that's that's really straightforward.
*  There's no complexity there.
*  But suppose I can't do an experiment.
*  Suppose I just have so-called observational data where that means that the data
*  is observed, but it hasn't come from any kind of deliberate experiment.
*  Then the question I should be asking myself is, can I somehow get information out of
*  the observational data, perhaps in conjunction with other assumptions that I think are
*  well supported that would allow me to answer this question about what would happen if I
*  were to perform an intervention in which I change C and how can I get an answer to the
*  question of whether he would change under that kind of intervention and under some
*  circumstances, you can actually produce mathematical proofs that if certain assumptions
*  are satisfied and you have certain information, then you are going to be able to answer that
*  question about what will happen under an experiment.
*  That's under if the experimental manipulation were to be performed.
*  So that's one way of getting at the normative question.
*  Sometimes you can at least get at the normative question or at least suggest that
*  there's something right about your normative proposal just by investigating various kinds
*  of inference strategies empirically.
*  So they don't talk about this in the book, but I do talk about it in a long subsequent
*  paper that I published earlier this year in a journal called Theoria.
*  There's been a lot of interesting work in the machine learning literature concerning
*  causal inference on the problem of inferring causal direction.
*  So suppose you have two correlated variables X and Y, you know that there's no common
*  cause. So there isn't confounding in that sense, but you don't have any kind of temporal
*  information that will allow you to determine which is the cause and which is the effect.
*  In the past, people have thought if you're just and you can't do an experiment, you're just
*  observationally seeing these a correlation of some kind between X and Y.
*  In the past, people have thought this was an insoluble problem.
*  You can't figure out whether X is causing Y or Y is causing X.
*  It turns out that given certain assumptions, there are techniques for solving this problem
*  that work pretty well.
*  And there are mathematical reasons why they work pretty well.
*  But in addition, the people who devise these techniques, they went out and they looked at
*  cases where the causal direction was independently known and they applied their techniques to
*  these cases. And it turned out that the procedures, just as an empirical matter, work fairly
*  well. So one of the things that they did, for example, was to look at the correlations
*  between altitude and rainfall in Germany.
*  Well, of course, you think that it's the altitude that's causing the rainfall rather than
*  vice versa. And fair enough, the results are pretty good at reproducing that result.
*  So there are sort of empirical calibrationist arguments that you can make as you can make as
*  well. So my my general story about rationality, it's a kind of means and or hypothetical
*  imperative picture, are the means you're employing, like a certain inference strategy or
*  something like that, getting you to the end that you want to achieve.
*  Now, I think it's true, as I've been saying earlier, that at least a fair amount of the
*  time, it turns out that people, the methods that ordinary folk use, in fact, do have a
*  kind of rational or normative justification of the sort that I just described.
*  But I'm not claiming that those methods that people use are justified just because people
*  use them. There has to be some kind of independent justification of the means and sort
*  that I was describing a moment ago.
*  So this is not that there's some philosophers who may think that we just take people's
*  ordinary judgments about things and we kind of we kind of systematize them and we
*  describe them. And that's the correct story about how we should think about causation or
*  normatively appropriate story about causal reasoning.
*  I don't think I wouldn't claim anything like that at all.
*  I think you need some sort of independent justification of this means and sort that I was
*  describing. But I think, in fact, given that standard, it does turn out that people often
*  reason causally in normatively appropriate ways.
*  So one of the lessons that I drew from the book, which was kind of a downer, really, is
*  just how complicated causation is.
*  And it just, you know, every freaking subject just turns out to be super complicated the more
*  you dig into it.
*  And that there are maybe.
*  OK, so there's a couple of different ways we could go here.
*  Being an ex neuroscientist, I'm automatically reflexively wanting to talk about scaling up
*  notions of complexity.
*  But before we do that, maybe as even kind of a teaser, maybe we should talk about different
*  notions of complexity, because, you know, growing up, I guess, in my naivete, growing up
*  scientifically, it seems like, OK, there's one kind of cause.
*  There's one notion a thing can cause something or not.
*  And I wasn't hip to the notions of proportionality, of invariance, of different notions of causality.
*  So maybe we can go through and just tease out why there are, you know, why there's not
*  just a single way to think about causation and some of the different notions of causality.
*  OK, well, as you say, this is a somewhat complicated landscape, at least from my point of
*  view.
*  Philosophers themselves have distinguished at least several different causal notions.
*  So one familiar contrast is the contrast between so-called type causation and token
*  causation.
*  Type causation has to do with something like a repeatable causal relation.
*  So if I say that smoking causes lung cancer, then I'm going to say that smoking causes
*  lung cancer. That's a so-called type causal relation.
*  Token causal relation, or sometimes nowadays it's called an actual cause relation, is a
*  claim to the effect that, for example, some particular person, Joe Jones, his lung cancer
*  was caused by smoking.
*  So that's one contrast.
*  And the way in which you find out about type level claims and the way in which you find
*  out about token level claims is an important way.
*  It's pretty different.
*  So any treatment of causation has to be sensitive to that contrast to begin with.
*  There are other kinds of contrast, too, that I could go into, and I'm not sure how useful
*  they'll be to the reader.
*  But I would one thing someone who I would particularly recommend in this connection is
*  Judah Pearl, particularly in recent work.
*  He's been very, very sensitive to different kinds of causal notions that really corresponded
*  very different kinds of causal questions we might want to ask about a system.
*  I mean, for example, we might want to ask, does this cause in aggregate have a sort of
*  total or net effect on some effect of interest?
*  That's one thing we might be interested in.
*  But often, particularly in biological, but also in other sorts of contexts, we have the
*  idea that a cause can influence an effect by many, many different routes along lots of
*  different routes.
*  So if you know, in a neurobiological context, if you give a subject a stimulus, there may
*  be a number of different neuronal routes that lead to some overall response in the brain.
*  You might be interested not in just in the overall effect, but what happens along those
*  individual routes.
*  And that's what's sometimes called a path specific notion of causation.
*  Or I talk about it in my 2003 book as involving a notion of contributing cause or causation
*  along a route.
*  So you want to make that distinction, too.
*  There are a bunch of other distinctions now, but that's only part of the story.
*  Of course.
*  Because in addition to different causal notions, I claim the following.
*  The basic interventionist notion of causation, I think, is a very kind of weak or minimal
*  notion. All that it really involves is the idea that there's some way of wiggling the
*  candidate cause such that the candidate effect will change.
*  Well, obviously, you in many, many contexts, you want to know a lot more than that.
*  You want to know a lot more about the detailed character of the relation between C and E.
*  And I have I don't in any way claim this is a complete framework or a complete classification.
*  But I have several different categories that I think are important when we try to
*  understand what I call distinctions within causation.
*  So in other words, we have a bunch of relations.
*  They satisfy this minimal interventionist condition for causation.
*  I was talking about a moment ago, but they differ in other ways we can make distinctions
*  among them. So, for example, causal relations can differ in how stable they are.
*  Or as I use the language, how invariant they are.
*  So it might be that if you wiggle C, E will change, but only in very, very specific
*  background conditions. So the C-E relationship is very sensitive.
*  You change anything even a little bit.
*  And the causal relationship between C and E breaks down.
*  Another possibility is that that relationship is comparatively stable or maybe even extremely
*  stable. Pretty much no matter what else you do, as long as C takes a certain value, E
*  will take a certain value.
*  And, of course, other things being equal, we value the stable relationships.
*  We we try to find them.
*  If you find a stable relationship, then if it holds in one context, you can exploit it
*  or project it to another context.
*  Well, let me just as an example, I mean, just to give the trite example of billiard balls.
*  Right. So that would be a highly invariant relationship.
*  What would it be?
*  Two billiard balls, one billiard ball hitting another and then the other one hitting another.
*  Like two billiard balls, one billiard ball hitting another and then the projection thereafter.
*  You could do it in water. You could do it in heat.
*  And the calculations would hold over lots of invariant situations.
*  Right. What would what would be an example of one that is non invariant that jumps to your mind?
*  OK, think think about an experiment which might be done, say, in a social science context.
*  You are interested in whether a certain teaching protocol or academic educational technique or regime
*  works to improve academic performance.
*  And you do, as people in this area do, you do a you do a randomized control experiment.
*  You have a you know, you treat some of the students, you expose some of the students to the educational
*  regime and you have a control group that aren't exposed.
*  And you find in the particular experimental group that you're making use of, maybe at some place in the middle of Indiana,
*  this educational regime boosts academic performance.
*  You then take this regime and you try it out in San Francisco or in New York City with different populations.
*  And it doesn't work there. That would be an example of a non invariant or relatively non invariant relation.
*  It might be that the relationship is genuinely causal and your your randomized experiment showed that.
*  But it's sensitive in all sorts of unknown ways to features of the particular environment,
*  the particular population of students you're working with and so on and so forth.
*  And so it doesn't generalize very well.
*  And I think it's unfortunately true that at least at present, a lot of the causal relationships that are
*  discovered in the social sciences and to some extent in psychology, too, they tend to be relatively non invariant.
*  They don't they don't export very well.
*  I mean, it seems like the vast majority of causal of causal situations that we're interested in are going to be of that type.
*  The ones that matter to us the most seem to the biggest class that matter to us are non invariant types.
*  Is that accurate? Well, I think I mean, I think it really depends on the particular case in hand.
*  And this is I hate to overgeneralize here because this is going to I'm going to get people in anyone in any one of a number of various scientific disciplines who may hear this is going to get upset.
*  In fact, that the relationships that are discovered in physics and chemistry and the more which I say,
*  molecular or physiological parts of biology, they tend to be more stable and or invariant than the relationships that we discover in, say, economics or psychology.
*  Now, often, of course, what I mean, the.
*  Of course, we're interested in the, you know, the relationships that are discovered in biology, chemistry, of course, but we're often what is really a particular interest to us are these relationships in social science and psychology.
*  Because since causation has to do with what has what will happen under interventions, we want to discover relationships that we can make use of for social policy purposes.
*  But it turns out that those relationships, even if causal, are tend to be they have very circumscribed conditions of application.
*  And exactly how one responds in these sorts of circumstances to that problem, I think, is a really it's a really it's really interesting and delicate question.
*  You can always say, well, OK, we, you know, the really stable relationships are there even in the social sciences, and we just haven't found them yet.
*  That's one possible is that what how likely is that?
*  I guess at this point, I'm a bit skeptical than anything like that is true.
*  But what is it? Is it maybe could one generalize and say, you know, because there are different I mean, maybe you have more to say about this, but, you know, the physics, the chemistry, these are all nano micro scale.
*  I mean, I know there's macro physics as well and macro chemistry, but is it accurate as a generalization to say that invariance decreases as scale increases or and or as I suppose complexity increases?
*  Yeah, I would think probably complexity is maybe the the relevant consideration here, because, of course.
*  Newtonian gravitational theory and general relativity works very well for all sorts of very large scale structures our universe.
*  So I don't think it's just a matter of size, but it may very well be partly a matter of complexity.
*  But in a way, when you talk about a system being complex, that's just sort of a.
*  I'm not sure how helpful that is, just because it seems to me to be kind of a label for for everything that we don't understand.
*  So I think the general question of what makes a system complex and what is it that
*  is going on in those systems that is kind of so makes them so refractory to
*  these simple forms of causal understanding, I think that's an extremely deep and interesting question.
*  Well, I'm going to go ahead and jump in here. I know that I keep interrupting us and interrupting your trains of thought, but I'm going to ask about
*  neuroscience and brains then, because a lot of a lot of the causal cognition work is done and a lot of the armchair philosophical
*  thought experiments are done on relatively simple systems.
*  But then and that's hard enough to grapple with as you go through in detail through the book with all of these different examples.
*  You know, what what is your outlook on how we will be able to scale these concepts?
*  I use the word scale, but in terms now in terms of applying this functionalist approach to causation to complex systems, in my case, like brains, but also in psychology.
*  And what I really want to ask you as a follow up is what you see if you have thoughts on this as the connection between a brain.
*  A mind and behavior, do you how do you see them causally connected?
*  Do you are you brave enough to tread those waters?
*  Well, let me start with your your first question, which, as I recall,
*  had to do with applying causal thinking to a system that it's as complicated as the brain.
*  And it's certainly true that there are features of that, though, that system and indeed other similar systems that make the post particular problems for causal analysis.
*  And let me just mention two.
*  One is the presence of causal cycles of various sorts.
*  In other words, where, you know, C influences E and E influences F and F influences G, but then G comes back around and influences C.
*  This is certainly, I think, something that you find in going on a neural processing.
*  And then another thing that I think makes the analysis so difficult is that you are involved in somehow trying to understand
*  processing that's going on at different levels, so to speak, at at the same time and issues about whether there can be causal relations across levels,
*  et cetera, et cetera. Then and if so, how you are even going to conceptualize that that becomes
*  very, very important in this context.
*  In some of the physical systems that we were talking about earlier, not brain, but simple physical systems, you often have a relatively neat separation between levels.
*  So if you want to understand what's going on at one level, you don't necessarily have to pay attention to what's going on at another so-called lower level.
*  So there's a certain amount of autonomy of levels, so to speak.
*  Well, that exists in neuroscience versus psychology as well, right, that a lot of people think that that autonomy needs to maintain because
*  it's dangerous or maybe reckless to start talking about between levels.
*  Start talking about what?
*  About explanation between levels that everyone needs to stay on their plane.
*  But I think that in the case of the brain, that sort of strategy isn't going to work.
*  There isn't the clean separation of levels.
*  And I think the prospects for a completely autonomous psychology, that is, you know, autonomous with respect to what's going on in the brain.
*  And I doubt that that's going to pan out very well.
*  So I think you have this situation when you have, so to speak, leakage between levels in structures like the brain.
*  And that makes also the causal analysis very difficult.
*  And of course, the other thing is we don't really at this point have all that good a handle or understanding on exactly what the units,
*  so to speak, are that we would expect in the case of the brain to be standing in causal relations.
*  One would like, obviously, given how many neurons there are, that the level of analysis had better be something larger than the individual neuron.
*  But what is it? Circuits, populations of neurons, something else.
*  If you just talk about, you know, gross anatomical areas like V1 or V2 or the hippocampus or something like that,
*  that seems, you know, far too coarse grained for these to be useful units of causal analysis.
*  Yes, I mean, I don't have detailed or useful suggestions about how to proceed.
*  There's increasing interest, I know, because I see papers about this from time to time among neuroscientists about what,
*  you know, if we want to have some sort of causal understanding of what's going on, first of all,
*  how do we even think about what causation should mean in this context?
*  And then, as I was saying a moment ago, what are the units, what's the level at which we can plausibly hope to find interesting causal generalizations?
*  Before, oh, well, no, before we get off this topic. So I don't know if you want to talk about downward causation at all.
*  And I was hoping to kind of tease you out to talk about that when I asked you my second follow up question,
*  which is what you see has the causal relation between a brain, a mind, however you define mind and overt behavior that we can measure.
*  Yeah. Well, so as you may know, this isn't in my most recent book of the causation with the human face book.
*  But in other recent papers, I've defended the idea that there is such a thing as downward causation understood as causation from a so-called higher level,
*  which usually the higher level is just a kind of coarse graining of some lower level.
*  There can be causation from a so-called higher level to a lower level.
*  I've been influenced by a couple of recent discussions and books of this about this.
*  There's a long and quite interesting book by George Ellis, the physicist and cosmologist, among other things, where he I think advances a he provides a number of plausible physical examples of downward causation.
*  That is examples from physics.
*  Dennis Noble in biology works on heart modeling, among other things, provides plausible examples from biological context.
*  So, yes, I see that I do think there's such a thing as downward causation.
*  And I claim anyway that it fits naturally within the interventionist framework,
*  because all that has to happen is you wiggle some relatively upper level or coarse grained variable in something at a so-called lower level changes in response.
*  That's enough for causation. It's not you don't really require anything more than that.
*  Now, there are lots of people who think that there are metaphysical and other kinds of objections to downward causation,
*  but partly because the interventionist framework for causation is so metaphysically thin, so to speak.
*  Yeah, I don't have any problem, I don't think, with making sense of downward causation.
*  So does brain cause mind and mind cause behavior?
*  Does brain cause behavior and mind?
*  Yeah, I'm happy with causal relations running in all directions.
*  Does mind cause all these directions?
*  Now, of course, when I talk about the mind, I just I assume that this is just something physical.
*  It's just a kind of more coarse grained and abstract way of describing physical physical going.
*  So I'm not here, you know, embracing any kind of dualism or anything like that.
*  I don't think the mind is something that's separate from the brain.
*  It's just roughly the when, you know, when we describe psychological or mental goings on,
*  we're just talking about, you know, what's going on in the brain or maybe even in the whole person,
*  just at a certain level of relatively coarse grained description.
*  Doesn't extend to the environment.
*  You're not an inactive pro-inactive approach.
*  That's something that I haven't thought about a whole lot.
*  I'm not I mean, I get why people want to talk about, you know, the role of the environment and embodied cognition and all that other kind of stuff.
*  I'm not sure at this point that any very interesting science has come out of that.
*  OK, I'm going to have Michael Anderson on soon, so I'll pass that on to him and see what he has to say about that because he's a pro-inactive.
*  Can we talk about laws for a second?
*  So I'll let you off the hook with the brain behavior, mind stuff here and go back to kind of the invariance aspects of causation.
*  I realized, you know, again, growing up in science as I was growing up in science, especially physics,
*  of course, where everything is laws, you know, the gravitational law, etc.
*  I sort of just accepted that there are laws in the universe.
*  And then recently I was in conversation with someone and I realized I had changed my mind so much on this that I told this person that I don't believe in laws.
*  And then, of course, they made a lot of fun of me. And do you think that the Earth is just going to fly away from the sun?
*  You know, that sort of stuff. Do you believe in laws or how should we think of laws?
*  Well, yes, I do believe that there are laws, although I may have a somewhat different picture of what a law is than perhaps other philosophers do.
*  So I just think of laws as highly invariant generalizations.
*  But that means a law doesn't exist, right?
*  That means that you give the name law to this thing that doesn't vary much, but it's not like a fundamental part of the universe, or is it?
*  Well, so here's the way I would think about it.
*  I think there's some causal claims and even things we might want to describe as laws can vary in their degree of invariance.
*  OK, so something can be invariant only under a very limited set of changes in other kinds of conditions,
*  or it can be invariant under a hugely wide range of changes in other conditions.
*  So take something like so-called Hooke's law, the so-called law, which says that the force exerted by a spring is inversely proportional to the well,
*  it's the negative of the extension.
*  It is inversely proportional. Sorry, it's the negative of the extension of the of the spring.
*  And that's the generalization. That's a kind of simple f equals minus kx.
*  That's a kind of simple linear relationship.
*  It will describe the behavior of some springs OK in a certain range.
*  But of course, if you stretch the spring too much, it'll break and the law will no longer describe at all what the restoring force will be.
*  So that's a generalization that expresses a causal relationship between the extension and the restoring force,
*  but it holds only in a relatively limited range of circumstances.
*  Compare that with Newtonian law of gravitation.
*  Holds under a very, very wide range of different circumstances, holds near the surface of the earth, holds for our solar system,
*  holds elsewhere in the universe, holds for masses of varying sizes, etc, etc.
*  But the Newtonian gravitational law itself will break down under some circumstances when, for example,
*  very massive objects are with strong gravitational fields are are in play when we're dealing with velocities that are very large in
*  comparison with the velocity of light, then Newtonian gravitational theory no longer applies very well.
*  And we have to go to general relativity. So that's my that's my picture.
*  We have the generalizations of more or less invariants.
*  So far, I think it's a plausible claim, although some will dispute this, that we haven't discovered any generalizations that are absolutely exceptional.
*  It would appear that in every case there are circumstances under which the generalization will break down.
*  And this is true even for the highly invariant generalizations that we give the name laws of nature to.
*  So in the case for general relativity, for example, it's thought that it will break down at extremely small link scales, the so-called Planck length.
*  Part of what the search for a theory of quantum gravity is all about.
*  So kind of degrees of invariance, it's not like there's something magical about the notion of law.
*  It's just. It's sort of like what's going on with the the spring and the restoring force, except much broader range of invariance.
*  And I think that's all there is to it. I don't think that anything more elaborate than that needs to be said about what makes a generalization count as a law of nature.
*  All right. So in the book you talk about you spend, I think, three chapters talking about invariance and different causal cognition, empirical studies related to invariance.
*  And then you finish the book with a chapter on proportionality. What is proportionality?
*  And what, you know, maybe your favorite illustration of results related to proportionality.
*  So. I said earlier that even if you among those relationships that count as causal in some minimal sense.
*  As captured by interventions and we can make further distinctions, one distinction we can make has to do, as I've been saying a little while ago, with how stable or invariant the relationship is.
*  Another distinction has to do with to what extent the relation between the cause and the effect are proportional.
*  So that's another distinction within causation. Now, what does proportionality mean?
*  Well, the rough idea is that the cause and the effect have to fit together in an appropriate way.
*  I'll give you an illustration in a minute, but I also before I explain anymore, I wanted to flag that this is also by no means an idea that's original with me.
*  It was introduced into the philosophical literature by Steve Diablo, or maybe now probably coming up on maybe close to 30 or 25 years ago.
*  So here is one of Diablo's illustrations of the of the basic idea.
*  Suppose you have a pigeon and the pigeon has been trained in such a way that it will pack at red and only red targets.
*  OK, you present the pigeon with a target that's a particular shade of scarlet.
*  And sure enough, the pigeon pecks.
*  Now, compare the following two causal claims.
*  The scarlet color of the target caused the pigeon to peck.
*  That's causal claim one.
*  Causal claim two, the red color of the target caused the pigeon to peck, because after all, the target in virtue of being scarlet is red.
*  And the intuition you're supposed to have is that the second one, the second causal claim, the red color of the target caused the pigeon to peck.
*  This is somehow it somehow seems better or more satisfactory.
*  And the reason why it's more satisfactory is that we've we set in the very setup of the problem that the the pigeon would peck whenever the target was red.
*  So intuitively, if you pick on if you say that it's the scarlet color of the target that caused the pecking, you've described the cause in too narrow a way.
*  OK, it's kind of overly.
*  Because it doesn't account for all the other shades of red that would also cause the.
*  Yeah, that's that's right.
*  So it's an interesting question.
*  So this is this.
*  Kind of intuitive idea that that the cause and the effect should be be at the same grain, so to speak.
*  That's another way of thinking about it.
*  So the kind of graining that goes on when you talk about the cause of the scarlet is it seems to it seems too narrow.
*  It seems overly specific.
*  Something like that, given that the effect is pecking, you want the cause and the effect to be at the same brain.
*  But several issues then arise.
*  First of all, can you make this precise in any way?
*  I've been talking about it in a sort of metaphorical way.
*  And then secondly, to what extent do ordinary people in their causal judgments
*  respect the idea that they that they prefer causes that are proportional to their effects?
*  And that's one of the things I try to do in the chapter.
*  I won't bore you with the effort to make things more precise,
*  but there is some experimental work that does seem to show that people.
*  Do tend to prefer descriptions of causes that are proportional to effects.
*  Is this related to intuitions that you spend some time in the book defending intuitions?
*  Maybe you could say a word about that.
*  I meant to ask you about it earlier, but we can tack it on here.
*  Sure. So it's a very common practice within philosophy,
*  generally, not just philosophical discussions and causation to appeal to so-called intuitions.
*  So you have intuitions here are just sort of kind of spent.
*  One way of think about about them is they're fairly spontaneous judgments about particular cases.
*  And reasoning about philosophical matters in this way is a very, very old tradition in philosophy.
*  You look at the platonic dialogues, they're full of these sorts of arguments about, you know,
*  would you consider this a case of justice? Would you consider that a case of justice?
*  Is this a case of knowledge? So on and so forth.
*  And unsurprisingly, the philosophical literature on causation is also full of examples that involve appeals to intuition.
*  That is what we would kind of the man in the street would ordinarily or person in the street, excuse me.
*  Oh, thank you. Yeah. Oh, you saved yourself. Nice job.
*  The person in the street would kind of spontaneously say.
*  And then philosophers try to construct theories of causation around this.
*  So, you know, and this is this got a bad name after a while, right?
*  Because it's not it's not it's not experimentally robust.
*  It's it's it seems and especially given and I know that, you know, that you find us all to be extremely rational and correct humans.
*  But we do have human error and those, you know, there are errors regarding our intuitions as well.
*  But. Yeah, so the.
*  There has been a huge amount of discussion recently about the role of these appeals to intuition in philosophy.
*  Some philosophers have criticized any kind of appeal to intuition.
*  Others have worried that when philosophers appeal to intuitions, they're, you know, they're basically, among other things, making claims about how.
*  People are so-called ordinary folk would judge or what they would say about various situations,
*  maybe those claims that the philosopher makes from the armchair are not empirically very well supported.
*  That's been another another line of critique.
*  One of the reasons why philosophers, really some of them, have been unhappy with appeals of intuition appeals to intuition is that at least some philosophers who appeal to intuition have.
*  Assigned intuition features that is very hard to see within any kind of kind of naturalistic or scientific framework, how intuition can have those features.
*  So, you know, people have thought that when you have an intuition of something that's involved, some kind of rationalistic grasp of the underlying metaphysical nature of things like that.
*  I do defend appeals to intuition in connection with reasoning or thinking about causation to some limited extent.
*  That is what I think is going on when a philosopher describes a case and then says, you know, my intuition about this case is such and such.
*  Is such and such is simply that the philosopher is reporting what he or she thinks or judges about the case and what the philosopher expects that other people will judge about the case.
*  So if I give you this is a standard scenario that's very, very simple.
*  And I think I'm controversial.
*  I describe a case in which two people, Billy and Susie, are throwing rocks in a bottle.
*  And the both rocks are headed right toward the bottle, but Susie's rock gets there a little bit before Billy's and the bottle shatters.
*  And then if we ask, you know, who broke the bottle or which rock caused the bottle to break?
*  Well, then, of course, it's the one that got there first.
*  That's our so-called intuition about the example.
*  And again, I don't think there's anything, anything very controversial about that, just understood as a claim about, you know, how people would judge or think about the example.
*  Now, one of the things I claim in the book is that at least to some extent, people in psychology who are doing experiments about the kinds of causal judgments that people make, they're basically in the same business.
*  As the philosopher who describes intuitive reactions to judgments, the psychologist is maybe being a little bit more systematic and maybe looking at a broader range of subjects.
*  It isn't just the philosopher and a couple of the philosopher's friends who are the source of the information about how people judge.
*  But I think it's basically the same sort of undertaking.
*  And to the extent that that's so, in other words, to the extent that the philosopher is just making empirical claims about he or she or most other people will judge.
*  You might wonder whether it's an empirical matter, the claims are correct or not.
*  And of course, you can go assess that in kind of obvious ways.
*  But there's nothing there's nothing problematic about that kind of appeal, that kind of use of appeals, appeals to intuitions.
*  You don't have to get into some elaborate or rationalistic story about insight into the nature of things or anything like that to defend that kind of use of intuition.
*  Now, an important distinction, though, that I do make in the book is the following.
*  I think it's one thing to say that philosophers may have a pretty good sense about how other people would judge in a certain range of familiar cases about causal relationships.
*  I think that philosophers and people in general, though, have very little insight into why they judge as they do.
*  In other words, I might be able to tell you that in a certain situation, people are going to judge that X caused Y and Z didn't cause Y.
*  But if you ask me then, well, how did you come up with that judgment?
*  Or what was the underlying causal processes that led you to make that judgment?
*  I don't think that that is something that, at least in most cases, we're in a position to
*  can't really answer questions about matters of that sort via appeal to intuitions.
*  In other words, we just don't have the access via introspection to the causal processes that generate our intuitions.
*  And I think one of the things that one of several things that can become problematic about appeals to intuitions and philosophy is that people sometimes think not just that they
*  have access to the judgments that they and other people are likely to make, but that they have some access to the underlying processes that are generating those judgments or the
*  underlying distinctions that they're relying on when they make the judgments and so on and so forth.
*  And I think that's a good deal more problematic. To get at the underlying processes, you really need something like experimentation, I think, of the sort that psychologists do, or at least some much more sophisticated form of
*  causal analysis. You can't really accomplish it just by introspection.
*  Well, right, because in my view, we can fabulate the reasons why the causal explanation of why we do almost anything. And it's embarrassing.
*  But we do.
*  Yeah, there's a huge amount of psychological evidence that people
*  at least often can fabulate about why they have made the judgments and decisions.
*  I'm certainly not someone who's
*  going to deny that that's the case.
*  All right, Jim, I have one more question for you before we go into sort of some extra time that I will release only to the Patreon subscribers, people who support the podcast.
*  Before I ask you this one last question, are there any, is there anything that we have missed that you want to highlight about causation with a human face that we haven't gone over? I know we kind of skipped around a lot of stuff and I interrupted and we went back and forth. But did I miss anything or did we?
*  Well, just very quickly, a couple of things.
*  Great.
*  One of the things I would like to emphasize
*  is the, what I see is the very fruitful interplay between the normative and descriptive in thinking about causation and causal cognition. I would emphasize to philosophers
*  that the causal cognition literature that's been produced by psychologists and cognitive scientists is really a very, very rich source of information and examples
*  for many, many of the problems that they're interested in and they should really, really pay attention to this.
*  Going the other way, as we were suggesting earlier, I think that paying attention to the ways in which people actually make causal judgments can often be rather suggestive for
*  the right kind of normative thinking about causation. If I may use an analogy, there's
*  in trying to develop
*  structures that do computer vision,
*  effectively, it's turned out to be very, very useful to try to investigate how the human visual system does it.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that similar thing is going to be true in connection with
*  And I think that similar thing is going to be true in connection with
*  causal cognition. If you want to build a machine that's good at causal inference,
*  you should pay some attention to how it appears anyway, human beings do it. Now, that isn't to say that the machine is going to be successful by
*  a copy in every respect what human beings do. The machine has certain kinds of abilities like, you know, abilities that
*  multiply enormous numbers together very quickly and so on, that human beings don't have. But I want to say that the descriptive stuff can be very, very useful from the point of view of
*  people who are interested in normative theory. So I want to just kind of get across this idea that there's this possibility of really, really fruitful interactions between the two.
*  Hold on, before you go on, I have just a follow up question about that because you alluded to the visual system and building these networks that map on to our, you know, visual system in our brains and can explain brain activity.
*  In that case, and we've talked about that kind of approach a lot on the podcast, in that case, the network maps on to like a well known, one of the
*  streams, visual streams in the brain, well known architecture and hierarchical structures, right, the hierarchy of processing. And while I don't even know what the current
*  current neuroscience of causality is, like what, you know, to use a phrenology approach, where in the brain causality happens, how causal reasoning happens in the brain. Do you have any idea? I really don't have any idea what the current science is because
*  you're talking about these, you know, if you created a neural network that was great at causal inference,
*  maybe we would learn something about how humans do it, but it's not clear to me.
*  There's not a ready known system in the brain that we could try to map that on to, at least that I'm naively.
*  I think that's true. I think very little is known about the
*  underlying neurobiology of
*  causal inference.
*  I will say the following though, in
*  the normative work that's been done on causal inference.
*  One of the things that people have,
*  one of the conclusions that people have come to, at least this is my interpretation of things, is that you basically need something like two levels of representation.
*  You need a level of representation that sort of tracks correlations, but of course we know causation isn't correlation,
*  just correlation. And then so the way in which this is, you know, captured in normative theorizing is there's an additional structure
*  over and above the correlational structure that, for example, might be represented by something like a directed graph or a set of structural equations
*  or something like that. Now, there's also a substantial amount of evidence that I go through in the book that human beings in their causal representations, however these may be located in the brain, also have this kind of two level
*  kind of representation. There's a sort of more associationist representation of the brain,
*  but there seems to be something on top of that that is apparently essential to
*  successful causal cognition. And this isn't just a matter of the representation of correlations. And I myself think that
*  this has implications for designing a machine that will engage in successful causal inference or learning. It's not going to be a machine that will engage in
*  And this isn't just a matter of the representation of correlations. And I myself think, and this is a claim that Pearl and others have made, that this has implications for designing a machine that will engage in successful causal inference or learning. It's not going to be a machine that just
*  represents patterns of association.
*  It's going to have to have additional structure to it.
*  Do you and Judeo Pearl hang out? Do you guys do coffees and make causality jokes and stuff?
*  No, not really. I mean, I do know him.
*  And certainly have talked to him on a number of occasions, but no, we don't hang out together, particularly since right now he's in Los Angeles and I'm in Pittsburgh.
*  And you're retired. You told me between these takes that you retired. I didn't know that. Congratulations on the retirement and I hope that
*  Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.
*  What else were we missing? You said you had a couple things. Did you cover them all?
*  Here's the other thing, and I guess it's implicit in what I've said already. One of the things that really appeals to me about
*  causation and causal reasoning, just as a general topic, is that it spans so many different disciplines.
*  So there's work in philosophy that I think is
*  sometimes
*  fruitful and interesting, but then there's also work in
*  machine learning and statistics, econometrics, and in psychology. And all of these,
*  you know, people in these different disciplines talk to one another, at least to some extent. So there's very, very fruitful interactions. So if you're a philosopher and you're interested in cross disciplinary work, this is a, I think, a very, very interesting place to be. And it is an area which, at least as I see it,
*  identifiable progress is being made. We're learning
*  more and more about all sorts of different things. And
*  you know, the issues about
*  causal analysis of complex systems,
*  thinking causally in a fruitful way when you have
*  so-called big data, enormous amounts of data, building machines that might conceivably
*  engage in
*  successful causal inference. These are really, I think, exciting and interesting issues. And so I just want to say, if you're a philosopher or even someone in another discipline, this is a,
*  this whole complex of questions and issues is a really, it's kind of fruitful and interesting place to be, from my point of view.
*  If we built machines that did great causal inference,
*  thinking about wanting to build machines that mimic our own general kinds of intelligence, would that mean that they would confabulate the reasons why?
*  Well, that's a very interesting question. That's a very interesting question.
*  You know, I guess to some extent, our tendency to confabulate is, you might think of it as a sort of byproduct of an impulse that we have that is actually quite useful.
*  It's searching for explanations for things.
*  I mean, we are the kinds of creatures that when something happens,
*  we want to know why. We seem to have an impulse to try to answer that question. And of course, that sometimes leads us to come up with answers to such questions that, you know, have
*  no empirical support.
*  Right. We throw the dice and just are satisfied with wherever they land, at least in this respect.
*  Maybe that, you know, I think the question, the relevant question we should be asking ourselves is not whether it's true,
*  does this impulse sometimes lead us to make mistakes or lead us astray, but
*  would it be a good thing if we didn't have the impulse at all?
*  Because that maybe is the trade-off.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's not at all, it seems to me the answer to that last question is probably clearly no.
*  So it's an impulse we have, but it gets,
*  it can go into overdrive in ways that it's not so.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no way it's an evolutionary mistake because evolution does not make mistakes.
*  But that's a whole other two hour discussion in there.
*  Okay, so I'm going to close before I ask you just a few kind of one-off questions.
*  If you had a, so you mentioned progress and that we're making discernible progress
*  in causation in lots of different fields. If you had a magic wand that could give you the one thing you think that would help you make progress as a philosopher in causation,
*  you know, be they experimental empirical results or some philosophical kind of breakthrough or realization. Do you have a sense of what you would wish for with your magical wand?
*  That's a very good question. And I don't have a
*  single answer to that question. I think a lot of the progress that will occur is going to have to be somewhat incremental.
*  There will be
*  mathematical
*  advances. There will be
*  additional
*  experimental work that explains better what it is we're able to do. I guess one general thing that I would be very interested in understanding better is
*  the following. We as humans, at least as adult humans, seem to have abilities at causal cognition that are
*  in many ways pretty superior to those of other animals, including
*  other primates. But I think the exact character of our advantage is not very well understood.
*  And I don't mean to suggest it needs to be just one thing either, but what exactly is it that makes us so much better at causal inference
*  than other animals? I mean, you know, other animals are great at, you know, kind of more association as forms of learning. So that by itself doesn't seem to be what the difference is. And so I think that's a really
*  that's a really interesting empirical question that I'd like to know the answer to.
*  Yeah, me too. I meant to actually ask you about that difference.
*  Of course, it's not going to be one thing, as we've discovered with causality. It's complicated. It's always complicated.
*  All right, Jim, thank you so much for the book. Are we going to see another one in 10 years?
*  Sorry, will I produce another one?
*  Yeah, in the next 10 years?
*  Well, I don't know. I mean, I have some ideas that might possibly go into a book.
*  Although I'm retired, I'm hoping that I'll continue working as long as it's as long as that's possible. That's certainly my plan. So we'll see.
*  You don't seem retired. I appreciate your time here with me today. And thanks again for recording it again. I had even more fun this time actually speaking with you, which was somewhat surprising, given that we did it before. So thank you.
*  Oh, you're very welcome.
