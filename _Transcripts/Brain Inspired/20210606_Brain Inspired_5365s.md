# BI 107 Steve Fleming: Know Thyself
**Brain Inspired:** [June 06, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdgWDnhjNgQ)
*  I find that very difficult to think about. You know, the idea that one day I might lose
*  the capacity to kind of know where I am, what I'm doing. Perhaps one route to achieving
*  artificial self-awareness is not to like build it all within the same agent, it's to try
*  and like increase the bandwidth, if you like, of natural communication between external
*  devices and our own natural capacity for self-awareness. So this is, you can think
*  of this a bit like a brain machine interface, but rather than plugging into like the motor
*  system, it plugs into the metacognition system.
*  If Steve Fleming entering his PhD program had come across this book, what do you think
*  he would have done? Had he read this book?
*  That's interesting. I think the one thing I would hope it would do is make me aware
*  that this is a field that exists, that we can do research, good research on metacognition.
*  You know, just making, just raising awareness of the kind of research area and hopefully
*  making it exciting for people to go into.
*  Hello, guys and gals, and all categories. This is Paul. Today I have Steve Fleming back
*  on. He was on recently on episode 99 with Ha Kuan Lao when we were discussing consciousness.
*  As a reminder, Steve runs his meta lab at University College London, where he studies
*  all the different angles in a wide variety of topics related to self-awareness and metacognition
*  and consciousness. Speaking of, on this episode, unlike the previous one with Ha Kuan, on this
*  episode we focus on his metacognition work, and specifically on his new book, Know Thyself,
*  The Science of Self-Awareness. So this book has a bit of everything you wanted to know
*  about self-awareness, from the activity of neurons to the involvement of different brain
*  areas, the modern computational models to advance a mechanistic explanation, up into
*  psychology and how self-awareness interacts with our many other cognitive functions, how
*  it varies across the lifetime, and beyond individuals to the role of metacognition in
*  sociology, and how and why self-awareness may have evolved, and of course the prospects
*  for and the desirability or not of building some form of self-awareness in AI, and our
*  eventual relationship with that AI in that scenario. So there's that and a lot more in
*  the book, and we discuss a handful of those topics. Actually we get to quite a bit, plus
*  my insecurity and my jealousy of Steve's career. So if you enjoy this discussion, then you'll
*  enjoy the book. There's really a lot more in there than we talk about. You can learn
*  more at the show notes at brandinspired.co.uk, slash podcast, slash 107. If you like the
*  podcast, tell a friend or support it on Patreon. Those are both great things to do. Thank
*  you, in advance. Okay, be good, be well, be metacognitive, and enjoy Steve.
*  Hello, old friend, welcome back.
*  Good to see you, Paul.
*  So Steve, I had, besides enjoying the book, which I did very much, nice job by the way,
*  and congratulations.
*  Oh, thanks. No, I really appreciate that.
*  Besides enjoying it though, I had two major kind of reactions. One was that it threw me
*  into a fit of jealous rage. So we talked a little bit about this when you were on Before
*  with Haakuan, but I sometimes look back and think about what my career could have been
*  if I'd stayed in academia. And what I realized, putting all of, obviously the book is filled
*  with all sorts of work, but it does highlight a lot of the different aspects of your work
*  and a lot of the directions that you've gone. And I think that it's a really good example
*  of something to aspire to in a career, right? It's like you're like a good role model because
*  I say that because when I envisioned my future, I envisioned a series of steps to, you know,
*  basically smaller and smaller questions. But somehow your interests and your research have
*  driven you to expand beyond maybe your original questions. And now you're in like 17 different
*  fields and productive in them. So it's really, rage is the right,
*  Well, it's kind of you to say, I mean, it does sometimes feel like maybe expanding too far,
*  right? So, I mean, method cognition takes you in many different places. So I think there's a
*  balance to be struck. I find that like the book really helped in a way by, I like kind of changing
*  the focus of the lens, like zooming in and out on a regular basis. And I feel like doing something
*  like the book means that you have to zoom extremely far out. So that was fun. But I do feel
*  like sometimes there's a balance to be struck. You need to get back to the zoomed in part to
*  kind of keep the science ticking over. So looking at that, you know, at that zoomed out level,
*  is that when it struck you like, oh, I've dipped my fingers in too many barrels here or whatever
*  the expression is, right? Or, you know, is it, does it feel pretty comfortable? Yeah,
*  I wouldn't say it's kind of too many. I think it also is nice, I guess, now that I have my own lab
*  and, you know, we have various students who come through. I think that then becomes nice because,
*  I guess, when you're early in your career, you know, when I was just finishing my PhD,
*  I remember kind of feeling like I was still stumbling around trying to find the question
*  that I wanted to work on. And it was really kind of only through my first postdoc that I started to
*  kind of get a sense of what that question was. And I guess, like now, I'm relatively comfortable
*  with what the broad question is. And now I can be a bit more responsive to what people in the lab
*  are interested in and try and like, fit those projects into the broader framework. So I guess
*  it's a balance to be struck, but it's nice to also be now seeing people come in and be really
*  enthusiastic about a particular topic and that might drive us in a different direction.
*  That's what you need is more directions, huh?
*  Well, yeah, I guess some directions like crop up, others just drop away over time if it's less
*  promising. There's also some directions where I feel like we've been a bit interdisciplinary
*  with the work on, especially say the work at the intersection of metacognition and
*  political beliefs and kind of the more social psychology end of the work that we've been doing.
*  Doing that kind of interdisciplinary work can be quite hard because you just don't, or we felt like
*  we were just dipping our toe in there and to really make a kind of concrete
*  research program there, we would have to kind of retool in a whole other discipline. So hopefully
*  what we've put out there in terms of like showing how metacognition research might be relevant to
*  that area of social psychology is useful for others, but I don't feel like my lab is going
*  to be the one who carries on building on that at the moment. I think that that's pretty good
*  advice for people to hear, whether you meant it as advice to graduate students, right? And people
*  entering into graduate school that by the end of your PhD or by the time you get your PhD, you may
*  not still have the question or the right broad view. Yeah, and I think, yeah, I definitely
*  feel like it took a long time and I see this happen to lots of people. And I think, you know,
*  looking back, I guess I was quite stressed at that time trying to find the question. I kind of knew
*  I wanted to stay inside. You feel that pressure. Yeah, you feel like you've got to carve out your
*  niche. You get told by people that if you want to kind of eventually become a PI and apply for your
*  own grants and so on, you need to have that niche. You need to have that, for want of a better word,
*  brand and like people know you for doing that area of science. And so there's pressure on there.
*  You feel like you've got to find it. But I guess looking back, just getting stuck in and doing
*  projects that you find interesting without trying to force it and keeping the enthusiasm and
*  curiosity up, I get the sense that as long as, you know, those core interests I had throughout my PhD,
*  which looking back were on metacognition and conscious awareness, like those core interests
*  kind of meant that when I stumbled upon projects that were more directly related to the neuroscience
*  of metacognition towards the end of my PhD, then I was in the right place to kind of
*  capitalise that and recognise that that was really exciting and we should go for it.
*  But yeah, it's definitely, it's hard to just say, don't worry about it. It'll turn out fine. But
*  like, you know, it definitely probably would have been helpful to hear from others at the time that
*  it would be okay not to force it, not to kind of like feel like you have to just artificially
*  create a research programme. I don't think that's ever gonna work.
*  Yeah. And there is kind of a, I don't know how you feel about this, but there is kind of a
*  magic that happens if you just kind of keep your head down and keep moving forward, you know,
*  eventually, you know, these like recursive loops in the themes in your own work come back,
*  and then it really starts to open up and, you know, you see the connections between some of
*  the things that you've worked on in the past and in the present and that really kind of broadens
*  things and eventually does make it feel a little more comfortable, I think.
*  Yeah, I think so. I think, yeah, it's easy to kind of like look back and start to see a narrative
*  thread connect different things you've done. But it's very hard to see that thread at the time.
*  And I guess with experience, like a little bit more experience means that you just have that
*  slightly more bird's eye view and you can see everything being a bit more interconnected.
*  And I guess that's what like, why it's, you know, what's the role of like a PhD supervisor or
*  you're the PI in your lab that in a way that's the role they should be playing. They should be
*  saying, ah, there's a connection between what you're working on here and something else that
*  we did like five years ago. So that really, it doesn't mean necessarily the PI knows more than
*  you do or is smarter than you do, but it's just like that they have maybe that they've been around,
*  they've been alive for a few more years. It's wisdom. Yeah, exactly.
*  Well, let's, okay, so let's get uncomfortable then to start this off. And what I kind of want
*  to know to start off with is, so the book, you talk about a ton of stuff that you know,
*  and that we know about metacognition, you know, psychology, the, the neuroscience,
*  et cetera, et cetera. And I'm just curious what your, I'm afraid that this will take us in 17
*  different directions, of course, because you're working on so many things, but like where the
*  edge of your knowledge is, what are you working on right now? Or what are you thinking on about
*  right now that you don't know? What keeps you up at night? Yeah. So there's a few different things.
*  I think in terms of the relationship to this, you know, the kind of material I talk about in the
*  book, I talk a lot about how understanding confidence formation at both a neural and
*  computational level might give us insight into how metacognition works. Right. And I think that
*  we now have one of the main messages of the book really is that we now have the tools to measure
*  metacognition in the lab. We have these objective measures of metacognitive ability, and that starts
*  to give us a bit of a handle on kind of a science of self-awareness. That's, you know, the subtitle
*  of the book and, you know, we had, there's only been relatively recently, and obviously the,
*  the models for doing that and the measures for doing that are evolving all the time. There's
*  still a lot to do in that area, but it's only relatively recently that we've kind of had robust
*  metrics, performance controlled metrics of, you know, how people are able to reflect on
*  and monitor their performance in various tasks, which is what we kind of define as metacognitive
*  ability, metacognitive sensitivity. So I think that, you know, that's really the main message
*  of the book that we have those tools available. We can now create this hopefully well-grounded
*  science of metacognition. And that then opens out and this is in the second half, I talk about how
*  that then opens up all these. Yeah. Yeah. We can, we can study how it affects kind of human
*  flourishing in lots of different domains. We can think about how it might emerge during childhood,
*  how it might go awry in cases of mental health disorders or brain damage. And, and so lots of
*  different questions that emerged just from having the core tools to measure metacognition. But I
*  think what I've been thinking about quite a lot recently, because we've been getting more into
*  the computational modeling of confidence is, you know, this distinction between what we think about
*  as representing uncertainty. So this idea that the kind of brain is an uncertainty tracking machine,
*  that to do things like, yeah, if you have like predictive coding type architectures or just
*  building hierarchical models of the world, you somehow need to represent how uncertain you are
*  about different aspects of that model. And that allows you to do things like decide whether you
*  need to gather information and all these kinds of things that we think that metacognition and
*  uncertainty tracking might, might help you with. But there's this kind of, it feels like it's quite
*  a deep distinction between the ability to track uncertainty at different levels of the system
*  and this kind of personal level self-doubt, this kind of personal level of confidence,
*  the ability to tell each other how confident we are in our memories or our decisions.
*  And it's unclear to me where the dividing line is there. You know, like, if you think of a kind of
*  hierarchical Bayesian model of perception, there's uncertainty at all those levels of the system.
*  So at what level does that become kind of integrated into a more personal level
*  representation of confidence? I think we, you know, we don't really know the answers to that. I think
*  the kind of work that people like Adam Capex are doing in animal models, like trying to see how
*  confidence representations generalise across different tasks, you know, that's telling you
*  something about those more kind of explicit or well-defined representations of confidence that
*  might be downstream from these more implicit, intrinsic representations of uncertainty.
*  Yeah, exactly. So I think that roughly speaking maps onto the difference between
*  implicit and explicit method of cognition that I talk about in the book. Although explicit also
*  comes along with this baggage of consciousness as well, this idea that explicit representations
*  are also conscious. Well, is that necessarily the case? Because explicit at least defined means
*  that you can report it, right? But then there's not a perfect alignment between reporting and
*  subjective awareness. But I mean, that's so that roughly is the distinction that I got as well,
*  but I wanted to ask you about that difference. So yeah, so people use the term explicit
*  to mean different things. I mean, you can think of an explicit representation as something that can be
*  used to guide various functions. That's kind of like not a side effect of representing other
*  content. It's kind of encoded directly in some neural population. So that would be one definition
*  of explicit. So this notion of kind of untangling representations down the visual stream, you
*  eventually get to an explicit representation of a dog, for instance. But then there's another
*  definition of it, which would be more about whether it's reportable, whether it's conscious,
*  whether it's accessible. And whether those two things go along together or not, I think remains
*  to be explored. So to come back to what you're kind of, you know, as you're talking about
*  where to draw the line, right? I just hear this fake noise in my head, you know, the ding of like,
*  all of a sudden, ding, it becomes explicit, right? And so I can appreciate that line because that's
*  always, I mean, like you said, it's wrapped up in the consciousness question too, right? We have all
*  these unconscious processes and where do we, it seems like all of a sudden there's a switch flipped
*  and then there, that becomes conscious. I mean, it's the same sorts of questions within metacognition
*  as well, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's right. That, you know, the distinction between
*  explicit and implicit metacognition does inherit a lot of the questions that are being kind of studied
*  in the difference between conscious and unconscious mental states more generally. To what extent
*  there's going to be a line per se, I think that's, you know, that's hard to conceptualise, like why
*  should there be something binary? I think that the right approach probably here is going to be
*  a functional one. This is one that we've been getting interested recently. So the idea that,
*  you know, it's an explicit representation of confidence to the extent that it's
*  invariant in the right ways. It generalises across different task settings, plays the same function
*  in different contexts, like being able to guide information seeking behaviour and so on.
*  One of the things you write about in the book is the prospects of improving metacognition and
*  the difference in meditators, people who do mindfulness meditation. And you can, I mean,
*  is that going back to the idea that distinct, the distinction between, you know, binary, right?
*  Either you're metacognitive or not about a given thing versus a gradient. So would it be
*  a fair way to look at it to say that someone who is a practising meditator might just kind of have
*  more access to some of these sub processes, right? That aren't at such an abstract
*  metacognitive level, but some of the more subtle sub processes that are still, you know,
*  can be readouts of metacognition, of metacognitive, oh, I almost said awareness, of metacognition.
*  But aren't themselves generally what we think of as, you know, the metacognitive thing or something.
*  Does that make any sense what I just said?
*  Yeah, I think it does. I mean, I think the data on meditation are promising. These studies are
*  difficult to do, but there have been a couple of papers showing that meditation training over a
*  period of a few weeks can improve objective metrics of metacognitive sensitivity.
*  So how well your confidence tracks your performance. But these improvements, so that
*  provides an interesting perspective on this issue of whether things are binary or graded,
*  because the improvements are graded. They're relatively subtle. I mean, they're statistically
*  significant, but we're talking about kind of percentage changes on parameters that we can
*  extract out of confidence-raising data. So what I think that means is like, we don't yet know
*  what meditation is changing there. What is meditation changing about the confidence
*  formation process, like the introspective process? The studies just haven't been done on that,
*  and we're probably going to need kind of innovation on tasks and models to be able to
*  answer that kind of question. But I think, yeah, the general idea that something like meditation
*  can kind of promote the coupling between explicit representations and more sub-personal
*  estimates of uncertainty in different processes. That seems like a really attractive hypothesis
*  to test. Yeah. I mean, all of these things we have to take with a grain of salt because something
*  like metacognition is such a higher level cognitive function that it is just intertwined with so many
*  of our other cognitive functions that you're not going to be able to... The goal of meditation is
*  not to improve metacognition, for instance, right? But there's going to be some effects in there
*  somewhere. Yeah. So this is a lot of stuff to work out. But you started off by saying that there was
*  a couple of things that maybe not keep you up at night, but that are kind of at the edge of what
*  you're thinking about right now. What was something else? Yeah. So I think the other one that I'm
*  getting interested in, it's related to what we were just discussing then on introspection,
*  but also what we were talking about on the other episode of your podcast on awareness with Hakquam.
*  And that's this notion that the metrics of metacognition we have are very kind of
*  third-person objective behavioral metrics. Like how well can you track your performance
*  in various domains? How closely does your confidence track your accuracy and so on?
*  But there's this other aspect to metacognition, it's one we've already touched upon, which is this
*  idea of introspection, that we have this kind of offline stream of consciousness that we
*  think about ourselves, we think about what we're seeing, we think about what we're feeling.
*  And there's some tantalizing hints that the mechanisms involved in those two notions,
*  those two views on metacognition might be sharing common resources like default mode network and
*  areas of association cortex that seem to be hierarchically quite deep into the system.
*  But I think we just don't yet have the tools. I mean, there's been some really clever research
*  on mind wandering to try and get at that offline introspective stream of consciousness, but I just
*  feel like we don't really have the tools to measure that on a nice quantitative basis and relate that
*  to moment-to-moment changes in brain function. And I think that we're maybe on the cusp of being
*  able to do that. So colleagues at UCL have recently shown you could measure replay in
*  the human brain using MEG so you can decode these rapid states that are getting replayed
*  while people are just resting after performing a task. But those states seem to be replayed so
*  quickly, just like in rodent replay, that they seem to be implausible that that kind of rapid
*  replay of the experience is going to be linked to the offline reverie that those subjects are
*  engaged in whatever they're thinking about when they're just sitting quietly in the MEG.
*  But that reverie and our consciousness is just so serial and slow, right? The experience of it.
*  Right. So yeah. I mean, maybe we're mistaken about that. Maybe it is faster than we think,
*  and then it all gets very meta-meta, right? But it feels like the kind of mind-wandering,
*  the kind of introspective offline processing that we think is happening a lot of the case when we're
*  just not on task, that presumably is linked to similar slowly changing states. And I think it'd
*  be super cool to be able to start applying those kind of techniques that have been used to study
*  other types of offline processes to start thinking seriously about what really is going on
*  when we're just thinking about internally focused really.
*  I mean, the MEG is just fast like EEG. It's good for the time domain. So that might be something
*  good for something like replay that just happens. It's just a sequence that happens basically as
*  fast as it can probably, right? Within some energy regimes. But I don't know how you'd apply that.
*  I mean, it's interesting because you started off by saying maybe one of the take homes that
*  you'd want people to take home from the book is that, hey, we've got these tools now and we can
*  actually use them. And now what you're saying is we need tools. So you're a tools guy. You've become
*  the importance of tools. Well, yeah. I mean, I guess part of the reason
*  I got into this in the first place, and this goes back to the kind of story of the end of the PhD,
*  is I was dabbling during the PhD with trying to develop ways of measuring confidence in perception.
*  And I was very influenced by work Hac-Kuan Lao was doing at the time developing the MetaDeprior
*  framework. And I was aware that this kind of work was in the air and people were starting to think,
*  okay, you could use the same tools from memory, meta-cognition research and apply them to all
*  manner of cognitive domains, decision-making, perception, and so on. And so I'd been working
*  as a side project during my PhD on applying. So my PhD was on perceptual decision-making.
*  And so it was kind of a natural thing to think about, okay, can we start measuring confidence
*  in those decisions? And I started reading around that literature. And then it was
*  towards the end of my time in London at UCL when I had a chance conversation with a friend,
*  Ramona Weil, who was doing her PhD in Geraint Riess's group. And she was
*  looking at these measures of individual differences in brain structure.
*  And she was looking at them in relation to perception. But we talked about how wouldn't
*  it be cool to start looking at those relationships in relation to other aspects of higher cognition?
*  And I kind of said to her, well, I'm looking at these ways of measuring meta-cognitive sensitivity
*  effectively. We didn't call it that then, but that's effectively what it was. So we thought,
*  well, wouldn't it be relatively straightforward and perhaps a bit of a shot in the dark,
*  but relatively straightforward to just start collecting together data on people who are going
*  through Ramona's studies of individual differences in brain structure. And that's how we started to
*  initially discover these links between prefrontal structure and function and meta-cognitive ability.
*  But when I think back about that work, which kind of really set me off on this path is that if it
*  wasn't for thinking about the behavioral measures, the experimental tools to do good behavioral
*  research, I don't think we would have ended up doing that study. And then since then,
*  I've always felt that once we built a tool or a way of analyzing data, usually behavioral data,
*  because I feel like my background as a psychologist means that I feel like that's where I'm more
*  comfortable trying to innovate, then we find we can use it in lots of other different ways.
*  Let's talk about your book. Let's go back to before we get into the nitty gritty,
*  but I want to know actually, if Steve Fleming entering his PhD program had come across this
*  book, what a lucky SOB, right? What do you think he would have done? How do you read this book?
*  That's interesting.
*  I mean, it's an impossible question.
*  Yeah, it is. It's like those kind of time warp questions like, what would you do if you went
*  back and were able to change something about your birth? Yeah. I mean, I think the one thing I would
*  hope it would do is make me aware that this is a field that exists, that we can do good research
*  on metacognition. Just raising awareness of the kind of research area and hopefully making it
*  exciting for people to go into. I mean, the thing that got me doing a psychology
*  undergraduate degree in the first place was I left high school not knowing what I wanted to do.
*  Usually in the last year of high school in the UK, when you're doing your A-levels, you apply
*  during that last year for university places. So you're kind of meant to know what you want to do
*  at university.
*  Which is ridiculous.
*  Across cultures, it's ridiculous.
*  Yeah. I do think this is where the American system has got it right, that you kind of like can
*  delay your choice of major a bit beyond school. But at that time, I was very interested in,
*  I was doing a lot of music and electrolyte music. I thought maybe that's what I want to do
*  as a career in various ways. I was never very good at it, so I probably would have ended up more on
*  the business or production side than actually making the music. But I basically didn't really
*  have confidence in anything I wanted to do. I ended up taking a year out and I went to work for
*  a, I did an admin job in an office in Manchester where I grew up. It was on the train in and out of
*  the city to go to work that I started reading popular science books on psychology, cognitive
*  science. I remember reading Pinker's, How the Mind Works, and Rita Carter's, Exploring Consciousness.
*  And I was absolutely captivated by just, obviously the books were interesting, the topic was
*  interesting, but I think the one main message that was kind of ringing loud and clear from those
*  books is just this field exists. And I think that's what then made me go and apply for that as a
*  topic at university and I wasn't disappointed. It was fantastic and just carried on through from
*  there. And I think if I could just make a handful of people feel something similar about, say,
*  metacognition and self-awareness research, that would be brilliant.
*  – All right. Let's really get in the book now because I started by saying that I felt a few
*  things after reading your book. One was the jealous rage. Another was, it made me feel highly anxious
*  as a parent. Have I taught my kids metacognition well enough? So let's talk evolution and cultural
*  learning because this is one of the things that you talk about in the book, which is wrapped up
*  in the development of metacognition, the origins of metacognition, where hunter-gatherers more or
*  less metacognitively sensitive and accurate. So yeah, I don't know. Do you want to just start us
*  off by talking about, because most of what we think about human behavior, we think about genetics,
*  right? And of course there's always nature versus nurture. But part of the genetics story these days
*  is it goes from top to bottom actually because even the wiring of our brains is not explicitly
*  coded in the genes because there's just not enough information capacity in our genes for
*  like a human brain. You could do it with a nematode and simpler organisms. You could
*  genetically code all of the connections. So even there, it's like the genes provide a starter kit.
*  I think that's maybe one of the terms that you use, one of the phrases that you use in the book.
*  And it seems to be potentially the case that metacognition is also along those same lines and
*  that's probably other higher cognitive functions. So talk about the evolution and
*  the potential of the origin of metacognition.
*  Ben Fiskens Yeah, I mean, it's a fascinating topic and it's something that I really kind of
*  started learning about while writing the book. I mean, the first half of the book is really focused
*  on this emergence of metacognitive capabilities in evolution and development. So looking at
*  comparative work on animal metacognition, also the recent brilliant work that's been done in babies
*  and infants kind of painstakingly measuring metacognitive abilities there. And I think that
*  the general message from work in human development is that while you can see initial signs of
*  uncertainty tracking in babies, so this is work from Louise Goupil and Siddharday in Paris,
*  when you measure metacognition using explicit reports, so judgments of performance,
*  it takes a while to develop. So even though, even in verbal kids in age three or four years old,
*  while their performance on simple tasks might be reasonably good, their ability to know when they
*  know the answer or know when they might be wrong is typically quite poor. It takes until the age
*  of four or five to that start to become in place. So the one message I kind of put out there is that
*  fully fledged explicit metacognition seems to be uniquely human. It emerges late in child
*  development. It also continues to develop in adolescence. So it doesn't seem to kind of
*  peak until around the age of 18, 19, 20. It's not a switch. Yeah, exactly. So the broader idea that
*  leads to is this idea that kind of self-awareness requires an extended period of learning about
*  ourselves and maybe the broader social group, our parents, our teachers help us gain
*  metacognitive awareness. And there's a parallel that I draw here, and here I've been very influenced
*  by the work of Cecilia Hayes at Oxford, who wrote a book on this called Cognitive Gadgets.
*  And she makes the case that for aspects of higher cognition like mind reading, so the ability to
*  understand other people's mental states, you can find evidence that that capacity is not acquired
*  from birth. We need to be in some sense taught to do that. And similarly to being taught to read,
*  this doesn't mean that genetics are not relevant. Clearly you need genetics to kind of wire up a
*  functioning visual system. But after that, you need to be taught how to read by your
*  social cultural group. And so the idea is that something like mind reading, some of the ability
*  to understand other people's mental states might operate similarly. It doesn't mean we're
*  necessarily intentionally setting up education programs for mind reading, but just implicitly
*  in our interactions with adults, we're getting kind of taught how to think about other minds.
*  And in a recent paper that Cecilia and I wrote with colleagues in UCL and Oxford,
*  we made the case that metacognition might be similar. And there's not much evidence out there
*  for this, but it raises a number of hypotheses that can be tested. And you can actually look
*  in the kind of literature on child development to find aspects of natural parent-child interactions
*  that might look like teaching of metacognition. So one example we use in the paper is the game
*  of peekaboo. So you're naturally saying to your kid, like, now you see me, now you don't. So you're
*  almost telling him or her what they're seeing, what they're putting a label, if you like,
*  on that experience. Now, so obviously there's lots of things going on there. I'm not saying
*  that that is the way of teaching metacognition. The peekaboo.
*  Yeah, exactly. We've cracked it. We're done. I never did it. Oh no. I never played peekaboo.
*  But there's lots of research questions that this kind of hypothesis opens up. It's very
*  much a hypothesis at the moment. But what's interesting when you look at research on
*  mind reading on false belief understanding is that there's not that much of a genetic
*  component there. So when you look at these twin studies in big samples, there seems to be
*  limited evidence for a genetic component to mind reading. And that lends support to this
*  cultural acquisition view. And there's just not any research that I know of, at least,
*  that has looked at the genetics of metacognitive sensitivity. And it'd be very interesting, I think,
*  to do that kind of research with the hypothesis in mind that maybe there's going to be less of
*  a genetic component than we might have originally assumed. Yeah, I mean, there's just all sorts of
*  questions that fall out from this to me anyway. I mean, one is, well, first of all, one of the
*  points that you make in the book is that metacognitive ability sensitivity comes online
*  roughly the same time as theory of mind, as mind reading. And then I just thought that's probably
*  when lying also comes on. My six-year-old is just a wonderful liar. So he must have high
*  cognitive, high metacognitive abilities and theory of mind. And that happens to be also when the
*  prefrontal cortex is undergoing a lot of development still. And maybe as that pruning starts,
*  happening a little bit more, that's when these things come online. So one of the questions that
*  this raises for me anyway, and I know you state a lot of them in the book and in the paper that you
*  referenced as well, might there be a critical period? Like even like vision has a critical
*  period, right? With all the monocular deprivation studies, there is a critical period in vision.
*  And I wonder if there might be a critical developmental period also, the peak of the
*  period or whatever, in development where if you miss it, if you miss that window, then there might
*  be some deficits in metacognition. We're going to go down the list here of some of my questions
*  about this. So. Yeah. I mean, I think there's two hypotheses to keep separate here. So one is
*  the notion that metacognition might be culturally acquired. And that you can use mind reading as an
*  analogy there. Maybe it's similar to mind reading in that regard. And then I guess the other
*  more heavy duty hypothesis would be that mind reading and metacognition share some common
*  resources. So the reason that they are both emerging relatively late in development and
*  come on stream around the same age and both appear to be compromised in autism, for instance,
*  like maybe they're both kind of being supported by some common resource. And you could think of
*  that resource as something like building recursive models of ourselves and others. I mean, it gets a
*  bit vague when you start thinking about it in computational terms, but that's kind of the story
*  I put together in the book. Or the capacity to. Yeah.
*  Right. Exactly. And one of the leading proponents of this is the philosopher Peter Carruthers, who
*  kind of put this strong hypothesis forward that basically the way that we gain explicit self
*  awareness, explicit metacognition about our own mental function is that we effectively apply
*  mind reading to ourselves. It's like we use the same tools. And I think there's some circumstantial
*  evidence surrounding that in terms of the developmental onset, the neural correlates,
*  and so on. But I think that's still a bit of a live question. It's something we're getting
*  interested in in my group, but there's still not knockout evidence, I think, for one or the other
*  hypothesis there. Another thing that
*  there should be essentially metacognition differences between cultures, like across
*  cultures, but also within cultures, how people have been reared, right? Differences in
*  metacognitive sensitivity based on how you're reared, whether that's culturally or within culture
*  among different groups in society, right? Is there evidence for that? I forget in the book.
*  Yeah. We actually have a preprint out recently. So my PhD student, Elisa Van de Plas, did a
*  letter study looking at metacognitive sensitivity with a collaborator of ours in Beijing and
*  in London. And obviously this is getting into an area where if you're going to claim a difference,
*  you better be damn sure it's right. So, hey, what about the difference between males and females?
*  Oh, God, here we go. But there was a subtle small effect size, but replicated across three
*  different experiments where the Chinese sample, and we took care to recruit people who had
*  kind of been living in that cultural milieu for several years and not just arrived in Beijing the
*  day before or arrived in London the day before and so on. And we did find a subtle advantage
*  in metacognitive ability in the Chinese sample. And obviously we don't know why that is. And we
*  speculate in the discussion of that paper that perhaps it is something to do with kind of a more
*  collective upbringing, more emphasis on admitting when you might be wrong rather than the kind of
*  Western individualistic, overconfident society. Now, obviously this is going way beyond the data,
*  but that is one hypothesis that came out of that cultural evolution view. And I think
*  that's one way into it. I think the problem is that to do really good cross-cultural research
*  is incredibly difficult. And I think that my hunch is that the developmental perspective is
*  going to be more powerful to answer the cultural acquisition question.
*  S1 05.05 What about child actors? Why are they such terrible human beings?
*  You don't write about child actors in the book, but I did think, thinking about the onset of theory
*  of mind and imitation is wrapped up into this as well, very human. And if we're imitating others,
*  and that's part of the process of becoming metacognitive, just thinking of like, child
*  actors are kind of scary, right? Because it seems like they're playing a part, but there's like
*  nothing inside. S1 05.06
*  I mean, so I touched upon this a little bit in the book in terms of pretense and like the idea that
*  there might be a link between self-awareness and play, which has been studied a bit in child
*  development. And it's fascinating idea that kind of the ability to somehow keep reality at arm's
*  length to kind of recognise that, you know, what people call the appearance reality distinction,
*  to kind of recognise that, like, I'm now in play mode, and I know what's real, but I can keep on
*  pretending. And, you know, that seems to be linked to the emergence of, I mean, as far as I know,
*  no one's studied it in relation to kind of objective metrics of metacognition, but it does
*  seem to be linked to other precursors of self-awareness, like use of mirrors and
*  use of personal pronouns. There are statistical links between that and engaging the age at which
*  you engage in pretend play. So I think there's kind of this idea that the ability to somehow
*  take a third person perspective on yourself kind of allows you to kind of say, okay, now I'm going
*  to pretend to be someone else, and I'll be able to flip back when I want to. It just reminds me
*  of that scene in Extras where Ian McKellen is like joking about what he's trying to explain,
*  how he acts, and he says, well, the difference is that I, you know, start out as Ian McKellen,
*  Ian McKellen, Ian McKellen, and then suddenly I pretend and I go Gandalf, Gandalf, Gandalf, and then
*  I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's pretty deep. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
*  You know, one of the implications of the cultural learning aspect of metacognition is the difference
*  between human metacognition and animal metacognition. So, you know, we've talked
*  before, I did my graduate work on trying to study metacognition in non-human primates, right? But
*  culturally, you know, animals who aren't humans don't have as much access. I mean, you know,
*  I don't know, is that a gradient? So, you know, you talk about animal metacognition in the book,
*  and one of the things I wanted you to talk about is some of the first studies testing animal
*  metacognition because that was interesting. So maybe describe that with the dolphins,
*  and then we can go on to sort of the difference between animal and human metacognition. I feel
*  like this is... Yeah, sure. So, I mean, one of the first studies of animal metacognition was
*  this really clever research done by David Smith back in the early 90s, and he was looking at
*  this ability for different species to track uncertainty in simple discrimination tasks.
*  So the way the task works, and the first paper was on this dolphin called Natura, and the way
*  they set it up was that they trained the dolphin to initially make a binary decision about the
*  pitch of a tone, so whether it was a low-pitched tone or a high-pitched tone, and then once the...
*  And the way they, you know, he signaled the pitch of the tone was by pressing one of two levers,
*  and once they trained the dolphin to be good at that binary decision task, they then started
*  giving tones that were intermediate between high and low, and so these were kind of ones where
*  it was difficult to know what was the right answer, and then they gave, you know, the option
*  of effectively opting out of the decision, so pressing a third lever, which meant you wouldn't
*  get your fish reward, but at least you could avoid a timeout penalty if you were wrong,
*  and so that effectively set up this incentive structure where if you knew that you weren't
*  going to get the right answer on that trial, if you knew you were uncertain at some level,
*  then you could hit the third lever, opt out of the trial, and eventually get a higher rate of reward,
*  a higher performance overall, and that task that, you know, the opt-out task has now been used in,
*  you know, many different settings, many different species, and, you know, this ability to kind of
*  track uncertainty in those kind of tasks seems to be, you know, relatively widespread throughout
*  different animal species that have been tested. But that, and, you know, so that's... You described
*  the opt-out task, and when I was in graduate school, there were already reasons to doubt that
*  that was sort of an explicit representation of metacognition, and so that, you know, like the
*  post-decision wagering is kind of an advancement from that, which is where the dolphin in this case
*  would have to, like, make the choice and then go back and bet whether it thought it got the choice
*  right or wrong. Yeah, so the criticism of that opt-out task was just as you said, like,
*  effectively you can think of it as not a two-choice task plus an uncertain option. You can think of
*  it as a three-choice task. Now you just map the middle of the stimulus dimension to the third
*  option, and it's all still in kind of first-order world. You don't need any second-order tracking
*  of how confident you are in that binary choice. So, you know, that, I guess there was then a bit
*  of an arms race, as you said, like, between non-metacognitive explanations of performance
*  on those tasks, and then, you know, the use of tasks where, and I think this has then enabled
*  a really nice fusion between animal research and human research, where the idea can you then use
*  post-decisional paradigms where you ask for an initial decision about, you know, on many different
*  types of tasks, and then train the animal to indicate how confident they are in that initial
*  decision via a secondary response. And that was, you know, that was your work, Paul. That was
*  discovering neurons in the frontal cortex of the monkey, right, that tracks that confidence.
*  Right, and the medial area, which is right in line with, you know, with human work as well.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's all frontal. And I felt like confident, oh, well, this post-decision
*  wagering, that's the way to go. But, I mean, it turns out that there are low-level explanations
*  for how that could be implemented implicitly as well. And so that's not a failsafe measure of an
*  animal's metacognitive, or what we consider, what we would consider like a second-order representation
*  isn't necessary, right? That's not saying that met animals are not doing it. It's just saying,
*  you know, the paradigms thus far that have been used in animals, and it gets harder and harder
*  to train animals just to do the paradigms, let alone do them accurately metacognitively, right?
*  Basically, all of them can be explained by these like low-level signal detection methods,
*  for instance, using probabilities and the way that, you know, sampling distributions and such.
*  And then you start to get in these higher, higher, I mean, this is why, you know,
*  more rage and jealousy from my part that you're doing this in humans, right? Because you can make
*  these really complicated tasks that really separate out the sort of implicit from the
*  explicit because you can actually report on your confidence. So...
*  Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, I'm not so sure we can completely separate it out. So I think
*  this is a challenge for human research as well. I mean, I think there's, in a sense, there's some
*  face validity just to reports. So at some level, if you're asking for reports of, say, confidence
*  in a task, then you can kind of guarantee that there needs to be some explicit
*  representation that's guiding that response. Even if it's just garbage, there's some,
*  you know, thing that's being accessed to make that report. And I think that, like, you can
*  start to approach that type of representation via the back door in animal work. So, you know, one
*  way of doing that is, as you say, trying to abstract away from, say, stimulus properties
*  from even the task itself. So, you know, I talk in the book about work from Nate Cornell showing
*  that, you know, you can train monkeys to rate confidence on or to indicate confidence on one
*  task, and then they can immediately generalize that on the first or second trial to a brand
*  new task that they haven't been trained on before. So, I think that's then starting to get at what we
*  mean by an explicit confidence representation. And recently, Adam Kepes' group had a paper in
*  TEL a few months ago showing that they could find neurons in the rat or the frontal cortex that
*  track confidence on two different tasks. So this kind of had this more domain general
*  confidence representation. So I think, you know, by looking at generalization and then also how
*  those confidence representations are used to guide behavior, you can start to get at something that
*  looked more like an explicit confidence representation in humans. And also looking at dissociations with
*  performance as well, because if it was just a, if we go back to the dolphin experiment, if it was
*  really just a kind of three option task, then you would imagine that if you, say, somehow managed to
*  abolish the ability to track uncertainty in that task, then it would have no bearing on the task
*  performance there. Whereas if the uncertainty representation was somehow separate, somehow
*  separately represented in the brain, then if you could selectively abolish that, you might
*  leave kind of the binary decision intact, but disrupt opt-out behavior. And that's effectively
*  what the Kepex group have shown in rodents that you can lesion the AFC in rats and that impairs
*  confidence-based behavior, but doesn't impair first order decisions. So I think there's parallels
*  there. Also, you see the same thing in humans when you're looking at patients with damage to
*  prefrontal cortex. We've done some work on this showing that metacognitive ability is impaired,
*  but first order performance on the task remains largely intact. So I think there are lots of
*  parallels to be drawn there. I think the kind of one missing piece is probably going to be this
*  more extended culturally acquired development that ends up being something like, more like the kind
*  of conscious introspection that we were talking about at the start, which we don't really have a
*  grasp on yet. So I think that that, you know, where the kind of objective metrics of metacognition
*  butt up against the conscious self-awareness, that's where I feel like the differences are
*  going to start to emerge. And the problem is we don't really have great tools for looking at the
*  latter apart from explicit reports. Yeah. You know, you mentioned Adam Kepex a few times. I
*  reached out to him a long time ago to come on to this show. I need to do that again.
*  I enjoy his work and communicating. Adam, get on the show. Come on.
*  Yeah. They're okay. If you're listening.
*  Of course he's listening, you know? So we've talked about, you know, kind of the cultural aspect of
*  building up metacognition in humans. And another thing you talk about in the book, and we'll come
*  back to this later when we talk a little bit about the implications in AI for this sort of stuff. But
*  as we age, there are lots of these wonderful diseases that we get where we lose our sense
*  of self. And you talk about a lot of those in the book. So that's kind of the downside
*  when we start losing that self-representation almost. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that one,
*  I guess, message of the book is that we have, in a way, we have these algorithms.
*  We don't understand them very well, but we do have these capacities very much grounded
*  in the wetware of the brain to be self-aware. And that means that it's fragile in the same way that,
*  you know, all other types of mental function are fragile. And in a way, that's a no-brainer.
*  That's obvious, but it feels like it's difficult to grasp on a personal level. You know, I find
*  that very difficult to think about, you know, the idea that one day I might lose the capacity to kind
*  of know where I am, what I'm doing, whether I still have good cognitive function and so on.
*  And that's very frightening, I think. And I think that, like, my hope is that by understanding a bit
*  more about why that might happen, we can maybe start to approach those situations with a bit
*  more knowledge. So I remember a situation where, you know, my grandmother had dementia and she
*  you know, was clearly losing insight into the cognitive problems that were coming along with
*  that. And I think that my grandfather at the time didn't really understand why she didn't understand
*  why, you know, those problems were happening. And he would kind of blame her in a sense. And,
*  you know, that's a completely understandable reaction. But in a way, I kind of think that,
*  like, by understanding that the loss of insight, the loss of self-awareness,
*  is part and parcel, unfortunately, of some diseases that are, you know, more common in older age,
*  that can hopefully provide a bit more understanding in those kind of situations.
*  Soterios Johnson Well, that's, you know, that also speaks to the importance of the social aspect,
*  I suppose, of metacognition, or its functioning in a social aspect, because, you know, often
*  people suffering from dementia are not aware that they're suffering from dementia. I mean,
*  I think it can be frustrating at times, they can, you know, show frustration, but it's not,
*  doesn't seem to accompany a large sense of awareness of what's going on. But
*  Chris McAllister Yeah, and also, you know, the loss of
*  metacognition about memory is one of the early signs of dementia. And I think, you know, my
*  clinical collaborators at UCL, you know, we're starting to work on this. And they understand
*  that acutely, just anecdotally, they can kind of almost like know that the patient who's coming
*  into the clinic has dementia because they're not complaining necessarily about memory problems,
*  they just show up on the test. Right. And but at the moment, metacognition is not part of,
*  say, a routine neuropsych assessment. And so this is one thing that I think we're trying to,
*  you know, raise awareness of that this could be possible to measure to quantify to potentially
*  protect against we don't understand how that might work, but it could work. And as you said,
*  like there's lots of functional consequences of loss of metacognition, you know, you if you don't,
*  if you're not aware of, say, potential memory problems, then you might not take steps to
*  a seek help in the first place, but also take kind of maybe adapt at home, write more lists and,
*  you know, not go too far away that you might forget where you are, and so on. So there's
*  kind of lots of implications there of like what lack of metacognition might cause both on an
*  interpersonal level, but also on a functional level. But you have to wonder, you know, if they're not
*  experiencing the strife that comes along with the lack of metacognition. I mean, it's really the
*  people around them that are experiencing the strife more so. So that's like a social function
*  phenomenon. Yeah. And I think there's is very interesting and important to think about the
*  fact that metacognition might not be an unalloyed good here, right? So that in some cases, maybe we
*  don't want more self-awareness and there's an ethical dimension to this. But, you know, there's,
*  I think there's certainly earlier stages of disease, then there does seem to be a sound rational
*  for trying to, you know, enable people to have the tools that they might need to adapt to changes in,
*  say, cognitive or memory function. But yeah, absolutely. I think there's an interesting
*  question about like, who is it benefiting? Who's the metacognition benefiting in situations like that?
*  You said metamemory and I realized the last time I was at my grandparents, who are both in their
*  upper 90s now, both 97. Wow. And still like, you know, cognitively mostly there, but I did,
*  I was there for like five days and I heard, I would say seven times that people used to get dressed up
*  to go on airplanes. I heard that story about seven times. It sounds like a good story that
*  I'd like to hear that, you know. I can tell it to you. I can tell it to you almost verbatim.
*  But, you know, along with the aging comes just the not caring about what other people think,
*  but which is, you know, helpful to a degree, right? But I know I've been told that I tell the same
*  story. I've probably told the same story on the damn podcast multiple times, which is scary.
*  You know, it's scary to think, but that's also a social thing because for myself, I don't care.
*  I only care like that other people don't see me as being cognitively unfit, right? By telling the
*  same story over and over or being unaware of my own abilities. So, I don't know. I'm just saying
*  I'm coming more and more around to your notion that social aspects, that there's a social
*  functioning of metacognition. You're probably right, Steve. That's what I'm trying to say.
*  Did, let's switch gears. Did you know that Ted Nugent got COVID? Do you know who Ted Nugent is?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't.
*  Okay. So he's a, and I'll just refresh everybody's memory. He's a classic rocker,
*  I suppose. Cat scratch fever probably is maybe is, I don't know what his hits are. I think that's
*  him. Anyway, he's a really strong leaning, right leaning COVID denier, but he got COVID, which,
*  my friend texted me just kind of joyously, Hey, did you hear Ted Nugent got COVID? I didn't really,
*  I don't follow Ted Nugent anyway. But this leads me into some of the other things. Another thing
*  that you talk about in the book is that, and I actually referred to this the last time we
*  talked when you were on with Ha Kuan. I see where you go. I see where we're going now.
*  It took me a while to... Yeah. Okay. Roundabout five minute delay there.
*  The splashy results that you got that showed how the lack of metacognition is correlated with a,
*  with political dogmatism. And that, and I don't know, maybe talk about that a little bit.
*  Yeah. So the, the research there was really to start to look at whether this capacity to,
*  I guess, recognize errors in simple tasks. That's what we're measuring in the lab when we're
*  kind of measuring this ability to track performance in various domains, whether that had any real
*  world bearing. And one approach to doing this was to start looking at large samples of people over
*  the web. So using these advantages, these advances in online data collection, we can now run
*  tasks. We can even do, well, almost do psychophysics over the web. And we can start to,
*  you know, get people to do simple metacognition tasks and then look at associations between
*  metacognitive capacity and other aspects of personality and, and say mental health as well.
*  We've done some studies on that. And one thing we looked at was the extent to which people
*  were more dogmatic in beliefs about political issues. And the rationale here was to think,
*  well, perhaps what is helping people say, recognize when they might be wrong about
*  something is a similar capacity to what helps them recognize when they might be wrong about,
*  say, a perceptual decision or a memory decision. So this connection potentially between
*  metacognitive sensitivity and political or dogmatism in political attitudes. And so we asked,
*  you know, hundreds of people to do these tasks and fill out these questionnaires about political
*  beliefs. And we then applied a big factor analysis to the political questionnaire responses.
*  And we extracted out a dimension that we called dogmatism, which tracks responses to questions
*  such as like, I think I'm right about these issues, you know, and everyone else is wrong,
*  and so on. And, and, you know, the, the, what was interesting is that that dimension was,
*  it was correlated with just political orientation on a right left spectrum,
*  but quadratically. So there's, you know, people at both at the right extreme and the left extreme
*  were more dogmatic, but it wasn't, you know, a, it was a pretty noisy correlation. So you could,
*  in theory, be quite centrist, but also be quite dogmatic. It's like, no, I am a dogmatic centrist
*  in my attitudes. Like the extremists are crazy and I am, you know, I do quite often now feel like I'm
*  a dogmatic centrist at the moment. Yeah. But so, but in, you know, in general, there was this U-shaped
*  relationship. So people who are more extreme at each end of the political spectrum were also more
*  likely to be more dogmatic in those attitudes. And what we found is that when we then regressed
*  those, the political dogmatism against task performance, we found, first of all, that just
*  being able to perform a simple task, like cognitive task, didn't predict anything about
*  political attitudes. So not hugely surprising there. What was perhaps more surprising was that
*  your confidence level in the task was also not very good predictor. So it wasn't just that
*  people who are more dogmatic were overconfident. Instead, it was that people who are more dogmatic
*  had lower metacognitive sensitivity. So the, this capacity to realise when they might be wrong
*  about a decision or, you know, an individual response on the task. And so the, and interestingly,
*  that predictor, that metacognitive sensitivity predictor, we then replicated that across a,
*  we just did a straight replication in a second sample. And in those, in both of those experiments,
*  that predictor was a stronger predictor of political dogmatism than kind of more standard
*  political science predictors like age or gender or education level. And so we think there's like,
*  you know, I talked to someone else recently about this result and their response was they listened
*  to, you know, this long description of all the science we did. And they basically said, well,
*  you know, it's a, I guess it's good that science is telling us something that we already knew
*  intuitively all along. And there is a bit of an element to that, I guess, that like, in a sense,
*  it makes a lot of sense that people who claim to be more, you know, certain in their worldview,
*  and they're not willing to listen to alternative opinions might also be unwilling to admit mistakes
*  about other things. But I guess what we were trying to do there is, is drill down into the
*  underlying cognitive processes like strip away anything about, you know, social affiliations,
*  about who your friends are, your, your, the emotional issues, literally just measure
*  metacognition on a really simple perceptual task that has no kind of motivational component at all.
*  And it was, we found it quite striking that there was that relationship between a very specific
*  aspect of metacognitive ability, and, you know, the dogma, how dogmatic you were about real world
*  attitude. One of the things that I find baffling is that on the extreme, the dogmatic political
*  views, I want to say that they must be missing, their elevator must not go to the top floor,
*  but it doesn't seem to correlate with IQ so much, right? Yeah, so I mean, I think what we found,
*  well, in that study, we had measures of education level. And there wasn't a relationship there.
*  Now, obviously, we're studying a convenience sample,
*  it's people who are already interested in participating in cognitive science experiments,
*  like online, where we have a relatively narrow distribution of IQ levels when we have measured
*  it over the web. But in other samples, when we have measured a proxy for IQ, we found even in
*  samples that are over a, over a thousand people, so very well powered experiments, we found a
*  negligible link between IQ and metacognitive capacity, even though we can replicate associations
*  like with decision speed, for instance, like the speed of processing hypothesis. So I think that
*  what we think might be going on there is that effectively, metacognitive sensitivity is tapping
*  into a style of thinking like self aware style of thinking that might not be the same as the ability
*  to like solve a ravers matrices task. Now, obviously, it then depends on what is your
*  definition of intelligence. Like, maybe it's good to have that self awareness for functional,
*  yes, you know, being adaptive human in the world, it probably is pleasant being pleasant person.
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. But, you know, in terms of the way IQ is measured in cognitive psychology,
*  in our studies, we've tended to find limited associations.
*  That's interesting. I mean, that must be fun at dinner parties, at family functions as well.
*  Because you can always just accuse someone of being metacognitively insensitive,
*  unaware, insensitive, because they'd probably take that as a compliment.
*  So I mean, there's so many other things that we can talk about. So but I want to make sure
*  that we get to a couple more things here. One is, you know, the artificial intelligence aspect of
*  this. So I'm actually I'm going to steal one of the one of the you know, you have quotes in the
*  beginnings of your chapters, which are fun. And one of the ones I think you use it earlier in the
*  book, but I'm going to steal it for and reuse it for my first novel that I'm going to write a sci
*  fi novel, which is about I'll just give the idea away. So someone else will write it, not that it's
*  a great idea. But you know, imagining right brain implants and our continued reliance on AI and on
*  gadgets, that in the future, in the future, that there will be like this gradual lessening,
*  speaking of losing, you know, our sense of awareness, our sense of self, that reliance on
*  these things will gradually take that away until there's nothing there, right anymore. There's no
*  personhood, no sense of self, you know, that'll be the that's the sci fi novel anyway. But so,
*  here's the quote. This is from Kierkegaard. The biggest danger that of losing oneself
*  can pass off in the world as quietly as if it were nothing. Every other loss, an arm, a leg,
*  $5, a wife, etc, is bound to be noticed. So that's like this. I mean, this goes back to the same
*  thing losing yourself with, you know, age related diseases, that it can kind of fade away without
*  even noticing it, which is scary is what it is, from from where I sit now. And in fact, you open
*  the chapter, talking about the future of whether there'll be metacognitive self aware machines,
*  with a story about the perils of relying on machines that are automated, an autopilot story,
*  maybe you could just relate that story kind of the gist of it.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a really tragic story. There's in 2009, I think it was that this Air France Airbus,
*  which was en route from Brazil to Paris, effectively just dropped out of the sky.
*  And, you know, everyone was killed and it was, you know, flying along. And it gives me chills
*  to think about the idea, you know, like those long haul flights when kind of everything settled
*  down, you're just like, you know, getting ready for the night crossing and, you know, just cruising
*  along at whatever it was, you know, the 30,000s of feet. And they encountered a storm and the
*  storm on the radar was not an unusual one. It was one that they could normally deal with. And it
*  caused the one of the airspeed indicators to ice up. And the effectively what that led to happening
*  is that the autopilot disengaged because it wasn't getting a speed reading. And it handed over manual
*  controls to the pilots. And the pilot, kind of the captain in charge was on a rest break.
*  The inexperienced co-pilot took over manual flying. And I think for reasons that the investigators
*  still don't really understand, he started to climb. And because the airspeed indicators
*  weren't working, it made it very difficult for them to notice that the plane was stalling.
*  And because then they were losing height, he then was constantly pulling back on the stick. And this
*  is the kind of thing that like, you know, I haven't myself learned to fly, but a friend of mine,
*  you know, learned to fly fairly recently. And he was telling me about how, you know, in the first
*  few hours of training, you get to learn how to recover a stall because it can be so dangerous.
*  So the thing you need to do is effectively just counter intuitively pitch down and,
*  you know, gain airspeed and then level out. And so it's the kind of thing that if you're a professional
*  pilot flying for Air France, you should kind of almost have in your base, you should be able to
*  do. But for some reason, he, you know, he didn't level it out. And it just kept losing altitude,
*  very slow, flying slow, stalling, and then just hit the ocean. And the investigator report,
*  obviously, it's very difficult to piece together exactly what happened in a situation like that.
*  But the one salient detail from that investigation report that I referenced in the book was that the
*  pilots had spent a huge amount of time, you know, they had lots of, they had thousands of hours
*  between them, but a lot of that time was simply monitoring the Airbus Altopilots. So they, you
*  know, they obviously have to go into simulators to practice for emergency. They're very skilled
*  at manual control. But in terms of the actual time spent on flight deck, it's usually monitoring
*  automated control. So it's obviously a tragic story, and there's lots of factors involved there.
*  But the kind of one of the lessons I tried to take from the book is this idea that, you know,
*  automation can seep into our daily lives, and we can become quite complacent about it.
*  You know, even in very professionalized settings, there might be cases where it's quite jarring to,
*  like, take back control. And I then, the chapter then becomes a bit of a futuristic look about what
*  might happen to our self-awareness in the future, as we start outsourcing more and more to
*  artificially intelligent devices. And, you know, the idea is that we might have, I guess, as your
*  sci-fi novel would claim, is that we might have more and more, or less and less, sorry, chance of
*  monitoring kind of difficult things we're doing, difficult decisions, difficult driving, difficult,
*  like, lots of things in life we find difficult, we need to struggle, we need to monitor how we're
*  doing it. And if we end up outsourcing a lot of things, then at the time we're asking ourselves,
*  we're asked to kind of step in and do something important, we might be like, well, you know,
*  I've spent my whole life just being monitoring other things, other artificial devices, and so
*  I don't have that intuitive awareness of why things have gone wrong and how to fix it.
*  How do I have a conversation without using an emoticon? That's sort of, but, you know,
*  an antidote to that, I just realized, and you talk about this in the book too, I think earlier in the
*  book maybe, I can't remember if I'm switching it up, is, you know, this is an age-old issue,
*  Socrates, right, who warned against writing, that the technological advance of writing would ruin
*  our memory and our cognitive abilities. So this is not a new idea, but it does seem more, I don't
*  know, more perilous now as we're, as we're, yeah, sloughing off more and more of our cognition to
*  AI. But you see two solutions sort of moving forward, right? One, and by the way, you know,
*  your particular work is, you know, if it's successful, if it continues advancing,
*  will lead to self-aware robots, right? The computational implementation of meta-cognition
*  eventually could be, you know, built into the robots, into AI.
*  Yeah, so maybe we should tackle that one first, because it is something we've been
*  thinking about a lot recently. In fact, we've just started a project with
*  researchers at Oxford, at the Oxford Robotics Institute.
*  There you go.
*  And we have a grant from, you know, the UK Research Councils to start thinking about ways of,
*  I mean, the meta-cognition component there is quite small. They have a broader grant on
*  autonomous systems, you know, not just kind of machine learning systems, but autonomous robots
*  that can kind of trundle around the real world and do useful things. And obviously, one really
*  difficult thing there is dealing with out of distribution data, like you haven't trained
*  your robot to, you know, encounter this particular situation, but it needs to be able to handle it.
*  And so, you know, classically, machine learning methods, AI researchers have known for a long
*  time that they tend to be overconfident about out of distribution data. So they, you know,
*  effectively have poor meta-cognition about things they haven't seen before. And so one thing we're,
*  you know, starting to think about is like, are there ways of learning lessons from human
*  meta-cognition research to the functional meta-cognition of robots? Now, there's already
*  a lot of cool work out there that's kind of trying to build uncertainty into AI systems,
*  like using dropout or Bayesian approaches and so on. But, you know, I think there's hopefully
*  quite a lot of crosstalk that can happen between human meta-cognition research and kind of the
*  development of robotics. And so, you know, I'm quite optimistic about that research program
*  in the sense of like being able to have useful confidence representations. It doesn't necessarily
*  mean we're suddenly going to kind of create a self-aware in a conscious sense robot, but we,
*  you know, building in some kind of useful confidence representations that can be
*  flexibly applied to guide behavior or also to then like hand back control. I think this is
*  really interesting. In connection back to that example I just talked about with the autopilot,
*  like if you have, rather than just switching off and going, right, take over, if you have a more
*  graded readout, if you like, of how confident the system is that it knows what it's doing,
*  then perhaps like 10 minutes out of this disaster you can kind of start to say, well, you know,
*  maybe it's telling us that it's not so happy with what it's doing. And that's very similar to what
*  humans do, you know, just naturally. You know, you can imagine two pilots saying to each other,
*  I'm not quite sure this is on the right lines. We should probably think about, you know, how
*  we're going to handle this. Yeah. Donna, come take a look at this. Yeah, exactly, exactly.
*  But so those are kind of the two solutions that you map out in the book is whether, you know,
*  moving forward, are we going to build these autonomous, completely self-contained AI agents,
*  or is it important, and you discuss why it might be important, to keep human in the loop,
*  and you favor the human in the loop. I guess for the reasons you just enunciated.
*  Yeah, I think there's, you know, the other one, which I guess is even more futuristic and not
*  really on our immediate radar yet, although who knows what, you know, might be coming down the
*  tracks is this idea that like, perhaps one route to achieving artificial self-awareness is not to
*  build it all within the same agent, is to try and like, increase the bandwidth, if you like,
*  of natural communication between external devices and our own natural capacity for self-awareness.
*  So this is, you can think of this a bit like a brain machine interface, but rather than plugging
*  into like the motor system, it plugs into the metacognition system. And I think there's,
*  you know, reasons to believe that might be quite useful. So, for instance, like, we don't need to
*  then potentially have working knowledge of how these black box systems are doing what they're
*  doing. Because, you know, as self-aware human agents, we don't have working knowledge typically
*  of how our own cognitive processes are working or our own biology is working. Like, I don't know how
*  my eye works, really. I mean, I know roughly, but I can recognize when my vision's out of focus and
*  I need a new pair of glasses. And similarly, you know, I don't know the biomechanics of how I
*  move my arm around in very much detail, but I can recognize when I might have fluffed a tennis shot
*  and, you know, need to think more about my swing, for instance. So the idea, and this then gets very
*  speculative, is that perhaps by developing a stronger interface with like human metacognition,
*  this doesn't necessarily have to be like a kind of sci-fi implant, but it could be just something
*  more simple as a kind of the right level of readout to get us to, you know, that what I just said
*  about like having some low dimensional confidence representation being continually fed back to us.
*  Something along those lines could end up being very useful for kind of retaining humans in the
*  loop while still benefiting from like the amazing potential to outsource lots of things to AI devices.
*  So you're not worried about us losing our sense of self?
*  Well, so yeah, maybe the reason I do favor the latter is because like the kind of just the
*  full tilt, let's build a software robot might end up being like, well, you know, then you get very
*  kind of into the territory of, you know, what's left for humans to do if we're outsourcing
*  everything and we're also outsourcing the awareness of what's going on there, then perhaps we then just
*  kind of become targets for delivery rather than active participants, active autonomous participants.
*  Yeah, and then it circles very interestingly back to the kind of, I mean, this is now you're really
*  pulling me well out of my lane ball, but I'm circling back to like the cultural evolution
*  aspects. And I've, you know, Cecilia Hayes talks about in her book about like how this view of
*  cultural evolution of cognitive capacities suggests the potential for new capacities to come online in
*  the future or was that we might have lost in distant history, which is fascinating, but it also
*  kind of points towards maybe something like metacognition being more fragile than we like
*  to think as a culture, as a species. Like it could well be that we kind of potentially lose
*  something like an awareness of ourselves, not completely maybe, but it gets transformed in ways
*  that maybe dull our autonomy in some important way. So I think it's, you know, how we chart a
*  path from here to something like that is very difficult to imagine, but like it's just useful,
*  I think, to be aware that that might be possible, because if that might be possible, then we need to
*  be probably quite careful that we don't go down that route. Do you think that we are more or less
*  metacognitively accurate than let's do the trope of the cavemen or the hunter-gatherers, right?
*  You know, it's interesting to think not just about metacognition, but also about our subjective
*  awareness and the quality. And I was going to ask you if those two track, if the quality of our
*  metacognitive accuracy tracks with our quality, I guess, of subjective experience. But you know,
*  it's interesting to think about, especially if it's culturally, if a lot of it is dependent
*  on cultural learning, you know, what that implies about our modern level of sensitivity versus
*  our future versus, you know, the past. Yeah, I mean, I think it's really hard to answer.
*  I think that there's some sense in which, and I, you know, speculate about this in the book,
*  about like the idea that because metacognition plays a social function, perhaps it's intertwined
*  with things like mind reading and the ability to think about other people's minds. Then one kind of
*  evolutionary driver there could have been, or cultural evolutionary driver there, could have
*  been the need to collaborate in social groups, the need to kind of coordinate when we're, you know,
*  going about our daily lives and we can't do everything ourselves, like hunting or cooking
*  or whatever it is. And we need to then kind of share out those duties and really track skill
*  in different domains and kind of online say to our partner, oh, you know, I just saw something over
*  there, so perhaps we should go and check it out. Like, obviously, language is a huge component of
*  that, but like the ability to comment on sub-personal mental states, like visual
*  uncertainty, perceptual uncertainty, whether I remember things well or badly, that kind of
*  capacity to kind of tell other people about your cognitive reliability could have been very useful
*  in enabling collaboration. And, you know, research by people like Bahadur Barami and Chris Frith have
*  shown that in laboratory settings, when you allow people to share their confidence in
*  perceptual decisions, they can achieve more as a pair than they even the best one could have
*  achieved alone. So that's kind of proof of concept that those, that kind of confidence sharing, that
*  sharing of metacognitive representations might have been really important, taking the long view
*  of evolutionary history. But I guess that, you know, one perspective on that when we kind of zoom
*  forward to modern life is that we're all becoming much more specialized. So if anything, it's,
*  I mean, it's hard to draw the analogy, I guess, but, you know, in science, especially, so we're
*  all becoming much more specialized. And it's increasingly paramount to know, you know, what
*  you know about a topic, but also maybe know what someone else knows and what you don't know about
*  an area and where you might be able to go and find that information out. And so in that sense,
*  I do think that like, it's unlikely we've got less metacognitive, that would be my guess.
*  But whether now we're outsourcing more and more of that kind of knowledge gathering exercise,
*  or whether that then means we're kind of at the top of the inverted U, that would be, that would be
*  a scary thing to contemplate, wouldn't it? We're, me and you, Paul, we're peak metacognitionists.
*  Wow, we're at peak metacognition.
*  Yeah, it's interesting. I think that like, but science does feel like a good analogy, you know,
*  being, there's a lovely book that Stuart Feinstein wrote called Ignorance, you know,
*  just making the case that doing good science requires you to be acutely aware of what you
*  don't know. And if anything, like our education system, like the way we train people to do PhDs
*  and so on, is too focused on kind of turning out projects and papers and not enough on
*  reflecting on what the field as a whole doesn't yet know and kind of searching for that. So I
*  think there's, you know, there's, there's, there's hope that we certainly haven't lost it. And perhaps
*  it's become more acute just because of specialization. Steve, we've, we've covered a
*  lot, you know, that you talked about in the book. Well, we didn't cover, we didn't cover some things
*  like, you know, the computational aspects, the modeling and stuff that you talk a lot about.
*  We did cover, I don't know, I still don't know why you, why you dislike child actors, but we'll get
*  to that next, next episode. Thanks for coming back, by the way. This has been a lot of fun. Again,
*  I'll see you next week, perhaps. No, it's been an absolute pleasure. So thanks for having me on.
*  The book is Know Thyself, The Science of Self-Awareness. I hope everyone goes out
*  and reads it. So thanks, Steve. Thanks, Paul. It's been great.
*  See you next time.
*  Bye.
