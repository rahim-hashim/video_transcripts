# BI 100.1 Special: What Has Improved Your Career or Well-being?
**Brain Inspired:** [March 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXbUuhS3Gis)
*  Hi, Paul. This is Brad Love. Thanks for having me. I know people say your show peaked at
*  episode 70, but I disagree. It's been going from strength to strength. These questions
*  from your audience are top.
*  In the last five years, in the last five years, in the last five years, in the last five years,
*  what new belief, behavior or habit has most improved your career or well-being?
*  This is David Crackauer.
*  Nicole Rust.
*  David Popple.
*  Megan Peters.
*  I'm Jay McClellan.
*  So I'm Rodrigo Cianchiroga.
*  Congratulations on 100 episodes, by the way. That's amazing.
*  Congratulations on your 100th podcast.
*  Congratulations on 100 episodes.
*  I just wanted to repeat, congratulating you again for your milestone. And I know it's
*  to begin with, but and to continue with, I think it's a massive achievement. I think
*  it's helpful for the community. It really is. I think it's also what was really interesting
*  was to hear from others, personal things, so very human things like, you know, things
*  like, oh, I need more time to think about matters. And I'm always bogged down doing
*  stuff and I, you know, I'm not thinking about it. I know I heard hearing from many others
*  say, well, it doesn't make you feel alone. And sometimes the system seems to be pressuring
*  in the wrong way. And that's probably a lot of what we are in at the moment.
*  So let's talk about well-being.
*  Maybe.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Man, are you kidding me? That last bit there was from Federico Turkheimer. He was expressing
*  his own thoughts about the people and ideas shared on Brain Inspired, which today turns
*  100 episodes old. And you heard a few of the names and voices of the many excellent
*  guests I've had on the show and whom you'll hear again today and over the next few episodes.
*  What a fantastic and challenging and rewarding journey this has been so far. When I started
*  the podcast, I was making a bet that there were enough of you that are like me and wanted
*  a podcast that could go a little deeper than most of the science podcasts out there that
*  are great in their own right, of course, but are geared toward the broadest possible audience.
*  I made that bet knowing it was a poor business decision on my part, since it limits the size
*  of the audience, of course. But I feel like it was the right decision, especially based
*  on the many emails that you've sent me with stories about how various guests and episodes
*  have influenced your thinking and even your careers. In some cases, many of you have enjoyed
*  the challenge of staying with the often demanding subject matter. I know it's demanding. It's
*  demanding for me. So I've put together a little collection of special episodes here to celebrate
*  all the guests through the first 100 episodes, because they have made the podcast special.
*  And I feel tremendous gratitude to them for spending their time with me. I feel tremendous
*  gratitude toward you, the listener also. Some of you have even decided to support the podcast
*  through Patreon. I just passed the $10,000 per year mark through Patreon, which if you think about
*  it, sounds pretty tiny as annual income, because well, it is tiny. But I consider it a major
*  milestone. I also appreciate every goddamn penny of it. And if that support continues to grow,
*  I should be able to continue the podcast and continue to improve it. So thank you to the
*  brand inspired Patreon supporters. Speaking of Patreon supporters, I reached out to them
*  for this 100th episode celebration and asked what questions they'd like me to ask all of the previous
*  guests. And I whittled down their responses to six questions. So the 100th episode will be in six
*  parts here. And this is episode 100.1, I suppose. In this episode, the question many of the guests
*  answered is, in the last five years, what new belief, behavior or habit has most improved your
*  career or well being? My own answer to this is, wait for it, wait for it. Obviously, it's starting
*  the podcast and sticking with the brand inspired podcast. And that includes for me personally,
*  stepping away from academia to do so. So I don't know what the future brings. But I do know that,
*  you know, I continue to learn a ton by doing the podcast. And I know I'm helping more people than
*  I ever could have if I'd stayed in academia. So for now, this is this is right for me. So I took all
*  of the responses and randomized them, because there's enough variety that it didn't make a lot
*  of sense to group them into categories. And I wanted something else besides alphabetizing them.
*  Also, through these six episodes, I'm sprinkling in a handful of reflections that I received from
*  listeners, especially Patreon supporters, about how the ideas and concepts that have been shared
*  through brand inspired has affected their own thinking, which I think will be fun to hear as
*  well. And we'll serve as little intermissions along the way. I've listed all of the guests in
*  their order of appearance in the show notes with links to their previous episodes if you're
*  interested in hearing more about about them. That is at brand inspired co slash podcast slash 100
*  dash one. Thank you to everyone who has made this show possible. I hope you all pay attention to all
*  the advice and personal experience that you hear throughout this episode and use it to improve your
*  own career and your own well being. All right, here we go. This is David crack our what new
*  belief behavior habit has most improved your career or well being? Well, that's hard. But one of the
*  things I guess that I at least have come to terms with is the distinction between productive work
*  and busy work and feeling at ease with not doing busy work. And the way that I do that actually is,
*  in any given day, I write down a list of one substantive item that I should accomplish and
*  several of this reactive or, you know, work related items that where there is a response expected,
*  and I just tick them off. And having completed those items, if I complete them in two hours,
*  I'm now free for that day. And I'm free to do absolutely anything I like without any feeling
*  of guilt. And that means it spares up huge amounts of time to read. And most of us,
*  I think, feel a little bit ill at ease reading, it's almost as if it's a zero sum game with
*  production. But we all know at the same time that without that requisite background, our work will
*  dry up, it will freeze. And so that's helped a lot. And it's led to much higher levels of productivity.
*  And so I just don't do all that sort of partial dilute activity that distracts us from the
*  awareness that we're not doing anything profound. I now know that I've finished and I now know that
*  I can indulge in any habit, I could just walk for three hours, and that's fine too. And I find that
*  else also helps a great deal actually in thinking through problems that I've got stuck on. So in
*  short, a very modest list, only one item of any real significance, and then a feeling of total
*  freedom. Once that list has been ticked off to pursue any activity that I enjoy, and where the
*  reality is my subconscious mind brain, have you is doing work that I simply couldn't do if I was
*  just sitting in front of my computer, fooling myself into thinking that I was being productive.
*  David Popol, and I work at NYU and at the Max Planck Institute. For many years, I like many of us in
*  neuroscience, obsessed about getting better and better about measuring things, right. So for many
*  years, we thought, well, if we'd only had better temporal resolution, if we only had better spatial
*  resolution, if we can measure everything all the time, we're all set. And the one thing I've learned
*  in the last five years is I'm not missing temporal resolution. And I'm not missing spatial
*  resolution. I'm missing conceptual resolution. I just don't have the right ideas to make
*  substantive progress. That's where things are falling short right now for me.
*  I'm Jay McClellan. You know, a few years ago, I was on sabbatical in London, and I just when I
*  discovered that DeepMind had come into existence, that I had a colleague who I'd worked with before
*  who was working at DeepMind. And I got a chance to visit. And it convinced me that some really
*  exciting new developments were happening. So I decided to, you know, a couple years later,
*  I decided to approach them and see if they would let me come hang out with them a little bit. And
*  they did. And it's been just totally amazing for me. Gave me an opportunity to meet all these
*  amazingly insightful individuals and to learn more about what's going on at the cutting edge of deep
*  learning research, especially deep learning research that's really focused on, you know,
*  trying to achieve artificial general intelligence. So, you know, I don't like,
*  DeepMind has goals, which are not quite the same as mine. My goal as a psychologist is to understand
*  how the human mind works. But it's just been truly awesome to have a chance to hang out with those
*  guys and think about, you know, the kinds of things that humans still don't do, and that
*  artificial agents are beginning to do and, and also the ways in which humans are still doing things
*  that our artificial agents aren't. So that's been an amazing opportunity.
*  It's Patrick Mayo. So in the last five years, what new belief, behavior or habit has most
*  improved your career or well-being? I think it's sort of a pretty basic answer, but time management
*  is a big thing. I think the further along you go, the more important time management becomes. And
*  having started as a faculty member within the past year, that's definitely been true. I considered
*  myself a pretty organized and efficient person, but it was time to step up my game, apparently.
*  So I've had to work on that. But that's been the most helpful thing. Okay, so my name is Marcel
*  Van Gerven. I'm chair of the AI department at the Donders Institute. What I did learn is that,
*  as I grow a bit older, it started to make me realize that I have finite time left,
*  which also means that I have to make choices on the things I find interesting, but also importantly,
*  the things I don't find interesting, right? That can help a lot in focusing.
*  Blake Richards. Yeah, one of the best things for my personal well-being in the last year or two has
*  been achieving inbox zero on a daily basis. Hi, this is John Crackauer. I think the thing that
*  has actually really improved the way I think about things that I care about the most has been, in
*  fact, to start the salon and work on a book for the general public. I would say those two challenges
*  have really made me think about what interests me the most in science more than when you're
*  doing it in terms of having to have a lab and get grants and write papers and design experiments
*  and consider the careers of grads and postdocs and junior faculty. If you're actually doing it
*  more from a sort of hobbyist standpoint, okay, I'm going to read everything so I can write a
*  book about it or I'm going to read so that I can talk about it with interesting people,
*  it's a different way to approach your subject. Does that make sense? That's what I've discovered
*  is it's a different way in, but that's what I would say about that. That actually doing what you do,
*  Paul. I'm Mario Negrello. I work at the Rotterdam Department of Neuroscience in the Netherlands.
*  I've been listening to the Brain Inspired podcast for a while now. One of the things that really
*  comes across the most is how we as a community come together and converge into our beliefs more
*  and more forming a sort of a meta-mind of the neuroscientists, a meta-neuroscientist.
*  And Paul has been interviewing these neuroscientists, channeling us. And this
*  really is a great representation. It's often these dialogues that I would like to have,
*  that I did not, but in fact I did via proxy. Nicole Rust. In the last five years, what new
*  belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your career or wellbeing? I would say lumens.
*  So over the past handful of years, I've rediscovered again and again that in the winter,
*  I can't drink enough coffee to really feel myself. So about a year ago, I did a bunch of research
*  into seasonal affective disorder and light treatment, light therapy for that.
*  And I even purchased a light meter to determine how much light I was getting throughout the normal
*  course of a day. And I discovered that even on a cloudy day, a good walk outside gets you a super
*  dose that's equivalent to what light therapy prescribes on most days. And so I have made that
*  habit and it's done a tremendous amount for my health and wellbeing on these cloudy, cloudy days.
*  Megan Peters, University of California, Irvine. In the last five years, what new belief, behavior,
*  or habit has most improved your career or wellbeing? So for this, I'd have to say that
*  learning to say no and learning that it's okay to say no and trying to do a better job in general
*  at risk and benefit analysis to protect my time, this has probably been the one thing
*  that I'm still working on, but that is making a very big difference in my life. When you're
*  a postdoc, you feel like you have to say yes to basically like everything. You've got to be really
*  hungry. You have to grab every bull by the horns and just like go for it because you feel like
*  every opportunity is like the opportunity that's going to make the difference in whether you make
*  it in academia or industry, whatever your chosen career is. But even when you're a postdoc, but
*  especially when you become independent as an academic, you really, you can't say yes to
*  everything. There's like not enough time in the day and you're going to kill yourself and you're
*  going to be miserable. So you have to be okay with saying no and you have to learn to say no.
*  You have to learn to weigh your options, like the risk benefit analysis, the value proposition of
*  like every opportunity. And I've made a lot of mistakes over especially the past few years and
*  earlier. I'm getting better at it, but I feel like learning not only to say no, but that it's okay to
*  sometimes say no to things, that's really an important first step. Andrew Sachs here.
*  In the last five years, what new belief, behavior or habit has most improved your career or well-being?
*  I like the quote from Amos Tversky who said, the secret to doing good research is always to be a
*  little underemployed. And I think that's, yeah, I think I've come to appreciate that, that focusing
*  on the quality of time spent on a project and the final output is more important than long hours
*  per se. And obviously sometimes you have to work hard, but I guess I come to feel like this research
*  endeavor is really running a marathon, not a sprint. And so having a rich life and living well
*  is quite important to the long-term health of science. I really think it is. We need to make
*  science an attractive career where someone can thrive in that role. And I think that's going to
*  lead to long-term success. You know, Darwin also, I think worked supposedly four hours a day and then
*  went for long walks. I'm not saying necessarily that approach works for everyone, but you know,
*  if it worked for Darwin, it can't be that bad. Federico Turcamer, Institute of Psychiatry,
*  Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College in London. The thing that has helped me in,
*  particularly in the last year, I was given a lot of time to prepare a new undergather course.
*  It's called Neuroscience and Psychology. And it's a course which is new in the sense that we're
*  really trying to connect the biology with the psychology. And we're trying to do that for
*  undergather students using computation and coding. This is really new and it was scary at the
*  beginning, but it really allowed me and others to take time, read the literature in depth,
*  which is a sort of large overview on one hand, but also trying to teach something practical and
*  useful. And I know, yeah, that was the first, the same attitude I had when I started this.
*  And at the end of that, you look backward and say, you know, I'm really grateful for that.
*  Yeah, I'm really grateful for that pressure. I'm really grateful for that time and the ambition.
*  That was, you know, something that needed to be done. Just take time, think about it. How
*  are we looking at the brain today and particularly at its disorders? Is there anything new
*  from the way we were taught 10, 20, 30 years ago? Of course it is. And I think you need to coalesce
*  all this material into some sort of clean, clear, accessible, practical set of lectures.
*  Okay. So I hope that that will be useful. So I'm Rodrigo Quenquiroga, neuroscientist at
*  the University of Leicester. In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has
*  most improved your career or wellbeing? Well, I think in general terms, it's looking outside our
*  typical sources as scientists. It's going outside the standard knowledge that we find in books,
*  in papers, in knowledge that is spread by colleagues and seeing what other people outside
*  our field thought about the questions we deal with. And in particular, this year I published
*  a book called Neuroscience Fiction. So I spent quite some time looking at science fiction and
*  seeing how much what some people thought, like writers or filmmakers or so on, I mean, how much
*  these things link to current research in neuroscience. And there was one particular
*  question that really captivated me, which is what makes us humans? In particular, I was interested
*  in thinking what makes us humans in comparison with artificial intelligence and what makes us
*  humans in comparison with other animals? So what makes us more intelligent to chimpanzees or any
*  other species? So how this changed my career is, well, at first when I was writing this book,
*  it was kind of like a curiosity. I just wanted to know, I mean, what people thought about.
*  But then I started thinking how can I really tackle this question? And what experiments could
*  I do since I do recordings in humans? I can record single units in humans to see if there's
*  something special about the human brain, which leads to our unique intelligence.
*  So yeah, I think that was a major change. Thomas Nosolaris, Department of Neuroscience,
*  University of Minnesota. In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, habit has most improved
*  your career or well-being? To me, it is increasing the number, quality and intensity of collaborations.
*  I think that in my case, at least my feeling of accountability to friends and colleagues that
*  I shared ideas with and made plans with, it's probably the single strongest motivation
*  that I have that compels me to actually get things done. The other motivation is curiosity.
*  That's just a motivation to get out of bed in the morning. Being curious doesn't mean you'll
*  actually produce anything. But having friends who've done work on behalf of a project that
*  you're invested in, that really makes you want to get things done. It also increases your
*  sense of connection to a community of ideas and of people. So that's what's been helpful to me.
*  Hello, Paul. This is Steve Potter from the Georgia Tech Laboratory for Neuroengineering.
*  Okay, finally you asked in the last five years what new belief, behavior or habit has most
*  improved your career or well-being. So a realization that's hit me in the last five years is that the
*  academic research model is just too slow. I have seen fantastic rapid advances by Neuralink and
*  Colonel Open AI and the Allen Institutes especially that have convinced me that we will get to
*  understanding and emulating the brain much faster when billionaires fund such research,
*  either for commercial or philanthropic reasons, rather than individual academics having to apply
*  for and win government grants to get a tiny incremental step accomplished with a small team
*  of researchers. We should take the neuroscience efforts of billionaires more seriously. I sort
*  of feel like people are writing off these guys because they're not real neuroscientists, but
*  guess what? They have a lot of money and they can hire the best people and those people are
*  really moving forward quickly. So I think that's the big idea that has really, I wouldn't say it's
*  improved my career because I have gotten out of doing research myself, but I think many
*  neuroscientists would benefit by putting more stock into what's going on in these big well-funded labs.
*  This is Brad Love from UCL. In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has
*  most improved your career well-being? I think I took the field a bit too seriously to my detriment,
*  be it personally, creatively, or in terms of productivity. I always found it a bit maddening
*  what people got excited about and valued and I mean don't get me wrong, some celebrated work is
*  fantastic, but that's not universal. Then I thought about my life outside science and so
*  when it comes to wine, I like these obscure French biodynamic natural wines. When it comes to music
*  that I listen to on Spotify, there's fewer than 2,000 listeners around the world.
*  I live in a neighborhood in London where the ride started and I like it. So putting it all together,
*  I realized that maybe these pop metrics of popularity are not the ones for me in any
*  aspect of my life. So really just thinking about how would that apply to science?
*  Maybe some pop science is not for everyone and I should produce things that I appreciate for others
*  who will get it. It would be great if everybody liked what I did, but that's probably not possible
*  for what I would find valuable personally. So I've always been internally directed,
*  just more so now and explicitly realizing that has been helpful. So I think this has helped me
*  break a bit with the structures of the field and it should lead to more interesting work in the future.
*  Hello, Paul. Congratulations on your podcast. I've been listening to it for the last year and a half
*  almost now and it's helped me a lot to focus and actually get to know better this field of
*  artificial intelligence related to the brain. And the interview that has helped me the most
*  was the one with Dilip George from Vicarious because he and his team is working on something
*  similar to the thesis of my PhD here in Spain. And actually I've used their algorithm of recursive
*  cortical networks published in 2017 in my project. So thank you a lot for actually taking the time
*  and effort to meet all these amazing people and make available this information to the rest of us.
*  I think you're doing a great job and please keep on.
*  I'm Steve Grossberg. So here goes. In the past five years, what new belief, behavior or habit
*  has most improved your career or well-being? Well, I love to travel and often flew to give
*  invited lectures all over the world. I particularly love to be invited to lecture in my favorite cities
*  in Europe and Asia, but flying all around America was also always a treat. In 2019, I flew multiple
*  times to give keynote lectures in Europe and across America. Each long flight unfortunately
*  ended with a cold that triggered a serious asthma attack. And one of those attacks led to pneumonia
*  and landed me in the hospital for several days where I was really seriously ill.
*  COVID made flying impossible. I've still been able to give keynote lectures and conferences
*  that were supposed to occur in Italy, Scotland and Thailand this year, but instead gave them
*  virtually via Zoom. Not only am I home for dinner, but I also have had no colds or asthma attacks
*  this year. I've therefore decided never to get on an airplane again to give a lecture.
*  It's an easier decision to make now than in the past because I've been flying all over the world
*  for over 50 years and have many precious memories from those trips.
*  Talia Conkle.
*  Okay. In the last five years, what new belief, behavior or habit has most improved your career
*  or wellbeing? Maybe this is not a good answer. Maybe when I separated Slack, this is like process
*  of doing science, when I separated Slack from my email and I made sort of all my lab research and
*  communications happen in Slack channels dedicated to each project and that left my email for more
*  admin and sort of separating those out really let me not have to toggle back and forth between
*  science and admin when checking my email and I can really focus on advising when I'm doing that and
*  I can focus on admin when I'm doing that and that habit, I suppose, has improved both my career and
*  wellbeing. I'm going to go with that. Okay. Paul Chisik.
*  This is Paul Chisik from the University of Montreal. Well, in terms of wellbeing,
*  the biggest thing was the birth of my son, which was actually eight years ago, so I guess
*  it's not quite so recent, but it just made such a big difference that when you say anything new,
*  everything else just seems like it's not that different, not such a big deal.
*  My life is so different now because of him. You have kids, so you know what that's like.
*  But in terms of career, things have been pretty steady, but the biggest improvement is that I
*  finally started really reading about evolution, spending a lot of time reading a lot of new
*  material to me about evolution of the brain as part of writing a book. So the book will still
*  take many years, but in the meantime, I'm learning so much stuff that my view about the brain is
*  really becoming changed and also has given me a renewed passion for the science of the brain.
*  That's really added a lot to my level of excitement. On the downside, I must say that
*  somewhat concerned that all this leads me away from a lot of the things that other people are
*  interested in because I'm just getting so excited about these questions that a lot of the people in
*  my field, they're interested in other questions. So it's almost like I'm removing myself from the
*  conversation, which is a little bit concerning, but anyway, I'm enjoying it a lot. So that's
*  really been a big deal. Can I ask you a side question about that aspect?
*  Yeah.
*  There's the possibility, what do you think about the possibility that it's actually beneficial to
*  remove yourself from the mainstream and that in the long run, that will be a helpful, you have to
*  have a lot of patience, but that will be a helpful thing for your career and I don't know, your legacy
*  as well, because you're not just doing what everyone else is doing.
*  Yeah, I think in principle, it would be good as long as you come back, right? I mean, if you just
*  go off on something that nobody actually is interested in, then not only does whatever
*  contribution you have just get ignored, but you can kind of go off in the deep end. I mean,
*  you kind of need other people's opinions every once in a while to bring you back to earth and
*  critique you a little bit. But if you're just off on your own like a hermit on the outside of the
*  village, that's not so good. I don't want to be that person.
*  Kanaka Rajan, I like this question a lot because it had a certain professional feel and a little
*  personal aspect to it also. So let me start by saying, what is the biggest belief or behavior
*  change that has affected or improved my career or wellbeing? And that has been changing up the
*  dynamics of a standard academic mentorship model in how I run my lab. So I did two things. First of
*  all, I picked people better than me to work alongside. And that has upped my own game. It's
*  almost like, you know, Serena Williams were my weekend tennis partner. The second thing I did
*  was that, you know, my postdocs are not my trainees, as they're normally referred to in the
*  field, but they're, you know, colleagues on a level playing field. And so, you know, those two
*  things have, you know, significantly improved, you know, productivity, sense of wellbeing, morale,
*  everything professionally. And so working alongside people of a higher caliber has just
*  changed my career. Now, personally, the creativity question appealed to me. It's, you know, I strongly
*  believe that having a serious interest that is not just, you know, science or work is crucial to
*  staying sane, staying grounded through, you know, many of the winding and rocky roads in academic
*  science. And so, you know, some people run marathons, some play instruments, dabble in
*  electronics. You know, I draw, so I've, you know, always been an obsessive doodler, but, you know,
*  now I've been making a much more consistent effort. And I, you know, recently realized that my style
*  of drawing has a name, you know, drawing from life urban sketching. And, you know, I realized,
*  I found out that the concept goes back to the Lescaux cave painting days. So tens of thousands
*  of years back. And since starting to do this more, I've come in contact with, you know,
*  brilliantly creative people outside of the scientific academy who have, you know, accidentally
*  improved my scientific work in weird and interesting ways. So that would be my thing,
*  develop something that is a serious interest outside of work. Hello, my name is Grace Lindsay,
*  Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London. In the last five years,
*  what new belief behavior or habit has most improved your career or wellbeing?
*  Kind of seems like those two goals are at odds. But I would say something that has improved
*  probably my career. And I think my wellbeing has been to just be more organized with my code,
*  like learn the, you know, tips and tricks that people who are properly trained in writing code
*  do. And just auto generating files that store parameters so that I remember what parameters
*  I've run when I run simulations and stuff like that. Probably a lot of things that, yeah,
*  most people who are trained properly in this do automatically and for good reason. But as a
*  researcher, you're not really trained how to write code correctly. And so things are usually a bit
*  chaotic for me in my code. And just being a bit cleaner about that, I think has probably helped
*  me a lot in many ways. My name is Conrad Karling. I'm a neuroscientist at the University of
*  Pennsylvania. So let's talk about wellbeing. One thing that has really helped me is that I
*  always make sure that I spend sufficient amount of time preparing my coffee. So I always have nice
*  latte and that just brightens every day. What also is important for my wellbeing is that I really
*  focus on spending quality time with my family. I don't work 60 hours a week. I start in the morning
*  around nine. I'm always finished by 6 p.m. and I don't generally work on weekends. There's very
*  few exceptions where I will work out of that interval. And this putting focus on time with
*  the family really, I think, also helps me feel better about myself. I'm Mark Humphreys at the
*  University of Nottingham. Something really simple is just dramatically simplifying my to-do list.
*  So for a long time, as a post-grad and as a postdoc, I spent years searching for a way to
*  organize all of my thoughts and ideas into something that would let me know what to do
*  every day. So I'd spend a lot of time thinking about looking at different systems and thinking
*  about ways of organizing this stuff. And I tried lots and lots of ways. Eventually I ended up
*  something of a getting things done aficionado, which is a productivity system that is used
*  all over the world. It's got a best-selling book attached to it. And it looks really complicated
*  and it kind of is quite complicated. Underneath those are a simple idea of every task that comes
*  in, you either decide to do it right then or you put it in some kind of management system that you
*  completely rely on to keep track of what you're doing. And that works really well for your
*  immediate decision-making. But what it tends to do then, it means that whatever your program you're
*  using or your notebook you're using to keep track of all these things, it just explodes with these
*  tasks that you haven't done. And then when you review them, you're looking at you basically have
*  this massive information dump of stuff that you haven't done every time you look at it.
*  So with getting things done, because you're constantly aware of this big task list,
*  I found that I was putting too many things on each day. So many things labeled as the next thing to
*  do that it became almost impossible to decide what was the next thing to do until sometime,
*  sometime last year, I just sort of stopped using it completely. I started just on a piece of paper
*  writing down the one or two things I would do tomorrow. And suddenly after years of telling
*  myself I need to build more time into my day, more slack so I can cope with things coming in
*  that I don't expect, suddenly magically I have all this time. So I'm now satisfied with most of my
*  days of work because I've done the thing that needed to be done that day. And then when things
*  come in that are unexpected, I can do something about them. Case in point being talking to you
*  right now that I read the email from you this morning saying, can you talk this afternoon?
*  And normally I would look at my to do list a year ago and I've gone, oh, well, I promised myself I
*  would do read this paper and I would answer this stuff and I would do this form and I would do this
*  today. So we'll move that to like next week or push it in the future. But now it's like, yes,
*  okay, I can do this afternoon. My name is Alex Ivanov and I'm currently a PhD student at the
*  University of Oxford working in the labs of Andi King and Kerry Walker. And I work broadly in
*  computational neuroscience and auditory neuroscience looking at how the brain encodes auditory
*  information. Yeah, I think the show has influenced me in like many ways. First of all,
*  it was really nice to get familiar with a lot of different research topics and to learn a lot about
*  different researchers that I've not necessarily heard about before. For example, Olaf's Porns,
*  like I totally didn't know about him and it was super interesting to learn about so many other
*  ones. Like it would be too long to enumerate all of them. And another thing is, apart from the
*  scientific content, I also really enjoy that a lot of the guests will share a little bit of their
*  personal stories and their lives. And that kind of influenced me as well and kind of made me more
*  confident to do certain choices that I was planning to make. And I also really enjoy how
*  the conversation is rather spontaneous, like you're just talking about stuff. And although sometimes
*  it can be quite focused and I can learn a lot about certain things, like let's say your
*  conversation with Carson Stringer on dimensionality reduction that was actually quite useful.
*  But very often it's also just the person is free to speak and it feels very spontaneous. And sometimes
*  I sort of mentally imagine that I'm just hanging out with you guys in some bar or something and
*  you're just chatting about neuroscience, especially if I'm doing something relaxing. Yeah, so I think
*  that's also pretty cool. Like the atmosphere of the show and the fact that there is also no ads.
*  I think like so many other podcasts have these annoying ads. My original background is from
*  molecular biology and biochemistry. So I tended to think about things very mechanistically. And one
*  of the reasons why I went into sensory neuroscience is because I enjoyed how you have
*  control over stimuli and you can sort of have this neat little thing going on for you. But then
*  listening to guests like John Krakauer or some like other people as well, I realized that it's
*  much more complicated than that. And actually it's really worth thinking about the cognitive side and
*  that you don't necessarily need to have like a molecular or circuit mechanism to have deep
*  understanding of something. And there's many ways to understand a certain system. And I think for
*  me this was quite a valuable lesson. Brain Inspired is a production of me and you. I don't do
*  advertisements. You can support the show through Patreon for a trifling amount and get access to
*  the full versions of all the episodes plus bonus episodes that focus more on the cultural side but
*  still have science. Go to braininspired.co and find the red Patreon button there. To get in touch with
*  me, email paul at braininspired.co. The music you hear is by The New Year. Find them at the newyear.net.
