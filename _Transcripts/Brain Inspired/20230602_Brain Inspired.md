# BI 168 Frauke Sandig and Eric Black w Alex Gomez-Marin: AWARE: Glimpses of Consciousness
**Brain Inspired:** [June 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrVtt4BYu2g)
*  The idea behind AWARE was to go to six radically different impressions or types of research
*  on consciousness from all over the world.
*  Obviously, materialistic science hasn't answered the question of consciousness.
*  So we were looking for people who were at least open to look into all sorts of directions.
*  I see documentaries, they have this potential and of course science fiction does this all the time.
*  They're kind of in the future, they just bring things we're still not ready to talk in seminar rooms
*  and they make it accessible and touchable by anyone.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Oh wow, the noise as well.
*  That's my line, Alex.
*  This is Brain Inspired, I am Paul and I'm here today with my co-host Alex Gomez-Marin.
*  So Alex has been on the show before, back with Michel Bittboel when we talked about phenomenology.
*  Alex and I had a conversation with two filmmakers.
*  So this is kind of a special episode or if it works out it might become kind of a mini-series.
*  The two filmmakers are Frauke Sandig and Eric Black and they created the film AWARE,
*  Glimpses of Consciousness.
*  You can find that film at AWARE-FILM.com and I will link to it in the show notes at
*  BrainInspired.co.uk slash podcast slash 168.
*  So like I said, Alex, you've been on the podcast before and you and I had kind of kept in touch
*  with each other and even your first episode was kind of a special episode because it was looking
*  at an alternative kind of an approach to studying consciousness and minds in general,
*  that being phenomenology.
*  Like I said, since then we've stayed in contact and we've kind of gone back and forth about doing
*  a special podcast episode or series.
*  And roughly the theme of that series is how art and imagination can inform and possibly affect
*  our science.
*  Would you concur that that's an apt description?
*  Yes, yes.
*  It comes from this need that I have to entertain ideas and perhaps the sense that
*  in seminar rooms and in scientific articles, one can do that to a certain extent because
*  the beds there are quite percussive.
*  There are some limits to how to entertain those ideas.
*  And when I watch documentaries, especially if they're good ones, I felt that that creates
*  a space to, even forgetting about fiction and fantasy, to just use imagination and see
*  where that can lead us in terms of the sciences we're interested in without losing rigor.
*  And there are quite a few documentaries out there.
*  And this one was one that we picked to begin with because it touches directly on
*  unconsciousness.
*  And so that was the idea.
*  Can we have a conversation with those who created the documentary and explore things
*  that matter to us as neuroscientists from another angle, from a slightly different
*  perspective?
*  So we've talked just personally briefly about your aims and intentions, but I was
*  reflecting on this and I thought one of the...
*  Okay, so I'll start here.
*  So you are kind of a...
*  I was going to say classic, but you're a case of someone who...
*  And correct me, please, if I'm wrong, who sort of came into science with the what you
*  call dogmatic thinking of science is the way to understand things and it's the only way
*  to understand things.
*  And of course, in this paradigm, I'll say that we currently live in where the brain
*  is a computer or machine metaphor, that current paradigm, which dominates computational
*  neuroscience and the neurosciences writ large and of course, artificial intelligence, etc.
*  But I say that...
*  Okay, so here's the way that I kind of see it.
*  And correct me, please, that often people go into their neuroscience careers, me, for
*  example, wanting to study consciousness, and thinking that, okay, this is the way to do
*  it.
*  This is the way to understand it and the best way.
*  And then over the evolution of trying to study things like consciousness or anything,
*  really, often in people's careers, they start to reflect and think, well, maybe there's
*  a different way.
*  And I think that your career has sped up that reflective process or you've begun reflecting
*  perhaps earlier in your career.
*  Is that a fair assessment of the trajectory of how you've gone?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  And it's difficult to describe to me even because I feel I have this escape velocity
*  where I enter a way of thinking more orthodox and then I start poking into, let's say,
*  embodied cognition and I become a bit heterodox.
*  But then I still carry this acceleration and this pushes me further and things happen
*  fast.
*  And yes, I've been reflecting and not just reflecting, I'm actually studying those things
*  to the best of my abilities.
*  And I'm more and more interested in consciousness from other sides.
*  I call them the edges of consciousness, how to look at human consciousness specifically
*  in places that are marginalized, but also in a way frontier.
*  And that's a strange situation, right?
*  Because there you start to walk in a territory where it's not so clear what is going on,
*  whether you are a scientist, a philosopher, or even doing some woo-woo stuff.
*  And but in a way, I care less and less.
*  You know, Paul, I don't want to make this too dramatic, but I almost died two years
*  ago, a few months after having got tenure.
*  And that was like a double slap in my face.
*  Like, what are you going to avoid?
*  And he said, what are you going to do with 10, 20, 30, 40 more years you have, given
*  that you have a decent intellect and more than decent conditions to pursue your interests?
*  So, okay, so I'll do it.
*  So I'm just following what interests me, but in a serious way, meaning not just what's
*  fun or cool, but questions that I feel are also at the heart of the humanity.
*  That have to do with our own existence and experience.
*  So that's where I'm now.
*  And yes, it's difficult to give a comprehensive account.
*  As John Cracauer once told me, he said, look, Alex, you're doing all these things,
*  all these dots in the sky, but where's the line, right?
*  There seems to be no clear path.
*  And I agreed.
*  You're right, John.
*  Maybe it's a constellation, like when you're doing astrology and you need to just
*  see what Gestalt, those dots mean.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just pursuing it.
*  All right, good.
*  Well, so I don't want this intro to be too long and I don't want to keep you, but the
*  point was to kind of introduce the idea behind our special mini series, if it becomes that.
*  And, you know, of course, to let people know where they can find the film, which we
*  discussed more in the conversation, but also then to just get maybe your reflections on
*  how you think this first conversation went and maybe where it might be going.
*  Yes.
*  Well, it was an experiment also for us, right?
*  Because I sometimes have conversations and I'm the host and sometimes the guest.
*  Here I was kind of in a superposition state.
*  I was both kind of a guest of your show and hosting the conversation with our guests again.
*  And we are trying to find out whether that's a triangle or what there is.
*  So that was already valuable to me to see how we can have this conversation from many sides.
*  Now, in terms of content and what happened, I think we touched on many things.
*  Some were more grounded, some were more in the air.
*  Maybe I was thinking how to summarize it.
*  Well, I heard this description, this metaphor of a kite, the idea of a kite.
*  And a kite needs this structure so that it can be in the air, but it needs a string.
*  Needs a string.
*  So that it doesn't just...
*  Yes.
*  So it felt like it was a kite.
*  Some places were more in the air and other places were more grounded.
*  And it's perhaps finding a balance between the string and the upper part of the kite
*  that we're struggling to find.
*  I don't know if we made it, Paul, and I don't know when people listen to it,
*  whether it's not even about liking it or not, whether they'll find this balance
*  in their own minds, but it's an experiment.
*  You have been in another band, the Hoodoo Gurus?
*  I don't.
*  Okay. So I've been having this song of theirs coursing through my head.
*  And one of the lyrics is, every kite has got to have a string for it to fly.
*  So there you go.
*  So that was an epilogue for the timing for me.
*  Lovely. That can be your motto.
*  Oh, yeah. There you go.
*  Okay. Well, perhaps we shouldn't keep people any longer,
*  but I enjoyed the conversation and I look forward to having more.
*  I'm also curious just to see how my very science-oriented audience
*  will find these kinds of conversations.
*  But in any case, the film itself is excellent from a scientific perspective as well.
*  And so you don't need to be woo-woo or on the fringe to enjoy the film,
*  and which tracks our ongoing attempt to study this mysterious phenomenon we call consciousness.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay. Well, without further ado then, do you have anything else to wrap up?
*  Oh, thank you, Paul, for doing this.
*  All right. Look forward to another one.
*  All right. Here are Frolka and Eric.
*  This is kind of the brainchild of Alex.
*  I reached out to him and asked if he wanted to do a special series of his choosing.
*  And we went back and forth a little bit and he ended up settling on thinking it would be
*  interesting to speak with you guys.
*  And Alex, I'll just let you explain because you'll do it more clearly than I,
*  your intention behind this.
*  Well, thank you, Paul.
*  I've recently been very interested by what documentaries can do,
*  by what art forms can do for science.
*  And podcasts would be precisely one medium, which I think is very interesting to convey ideas,
*  but not only to communicate, also to think them through.
*  And so I came across your documentary and I felt, well, I'm so interested in consciousness,
*  so interested. That's what I'm doing, I would say. That's what I'm researching.
*  And there's certain ideas or even certain questions
*  that are really hard even to entertain in scientific environments, in academic environments.
*  But here you have a documentary and it's beautiful to watch and it's entertaining as it should.
*  And at the same time, it felt it opened a space to really be a scientist of consciousness and ask
*  those questions, not so much try to provide answers.
*  And so that's why Paul and I were talking. Well, wouldn't it be interesting to have
*  conversations with those of you who create these documentaries and see what, again,
*  what documentaries can do for science and what science can do for documentaries back and forth.
*  So that's a little bit the spirit of this quest.
*  Okay.
*  So just to give a little background, and I don't know, maybe we'll just keep this in.
*  So the film that we're going to focus on more is called Aware, Glimpses of Consciousness,
*  but it's the second in a series of three films, I believe.
*  And maybe I'll ask you in a bit what the third is and when it is coming.
*  But the first film is called Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth.
*  And so I don't know if you guys want to talk about just the arc of these kinds of films
*  to start off, just to give us a background of what we're talking about.
*  Yeah, the first film, I mean, which we consider to be a trilogy,
*  of the Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth.
*  It is about the Maya in Mexico and Guatemala, the Maya of today.
*  And somehow this film inspired us to think about consciousness because the Maya,
*  like many indigenous people, have a very different understanding of spirit,
*  of consciousness, of the natural world than we have usually in the Western world.
*  And or, yeah, or in the white world or whatever you will call it.
*  So for the Maya, like for many other indigenous people, everything in the world is animated,
*  has a soul, has spirit, has consciousness, has a mind.
*  And so when we were filming, one of our protagonists, who is a woman, Maya and spiritual
*  leader, confronted us and she said, well, for you in the West and for you whites,
*  everything is always separated.
*  Like here's the house, here's the tree, here's the animal, and here are you.
*  So and for us indigenous people, everything is always interconnected.
*  And I think this is what inspired us a lot to think about our worldview and
*  to think about this interconnections of spirit and nature and
*  the idea there is an interconnection between spirit and matter and it might not be separated
*  things. So that inspired us to think about aware glimpses of consciousness.
*  Well, actually, we try to connect the scientific view because we actually invited
*  six people, five of them are real scientists, one philosopher, one brain researcher, a Buddhist
*  monk, but who is actually a bio, who has a PhD in molecular biology.
*  I think, Fraka, maybe it's for me.
*  Fraka froze on me.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, let me try to pick that up.
*  What we tried to do with aware is that we really, in essence, we turned the cameras around on
*  ourselves. I mean, not literally as in focusing on ourselves, but when you're with the Maya,
*  and we spent three years with the indigenous Maya, and they would constantly ask us,
*  what are you doing on your spiritual path in the same way someone else might ask,
*  how are you going to go shopping on Tuesday? And this happened to us often. And we thought, well,
*  let's look at our ideas about consciousness or as the Maya would call it, Cosmovision,
*  and this film was really an attempt to get under not only ours, but
*  as a journey for ourselves also into the world of consciousness,
*  which is something that I... I mean, the beauty of documentary is that all of a sudden you get
*  to focus on something. It's like getting a PhD. All of a sudden, everything you read, everything
*  you're thinking about is... And it's a type of focus that I normally don't have or get to indulge.
*  And the idea behind aware was to go to six radically different
*  impressions or types of research on consciousness from all over the world. One was still a Maya
*  curandera, as Frauke said. One was a Tibetan Buddhist monk. Another one is Christophe Koch,
*  who is an Alex, correct me if I'm wrong, probably the most famous neuroscientist in the world,
*  who heads up... Well, he also has the Faustian contract. I mean, he was given an unbelievable
*  amount of money by Paul Allen, the map, the human brain. So he certainly shows up in the news more
*  than most. And then there's a philosopher, and then probably the most famous is Roland Griffiths,
*  who heads the psychedelic studies on psilocybin at Johns Hopkins, who we followed over three years.
*  And I'm sure I missed somebody. I always do. Oh, Monica, who we call the... We call her the Jane
*  Goodall of plants. She did for plants what Jane Goodall did for animals. And initially, we thought
*  that these would be very disparate views about consciousness. And I think the greatest surprise
*  was that we found that in spite of the fact that we intended and went out of our way to find
*  radically different perspectives, they were remarkably similar in the end. We had this idea,
*  we used the metaphor of the six blind men and the elephant, which is an Indian parable about the
*  blind men who go out and come back with completely different descriptions of an elephant in the
*  middle of the night. And only when you hear all six of them, do you understand that it's an elephant.
*  Well, that's the metaphor we used, and we pretend to use it all the way through the film,
*  but actually it doesn't hold up. Actually, what they all had to say about consciousness was
*  remarkably similar. And I think no one was as surprised as I, frankly, by the fact that we
*  ended up not with a vague... I'm not going to use the word understanding, but an image of consciousness,
*  but actually a rather concrete mosaic in terms of putting together these disparate views.
*  I'm going to leave it there for a minute. Broker, are you back online now?
*  Yeah, I don't know what threw me out.
*  No, you were frozen.
*  No, I was really thrown out of the Zoom conference. I don't know,
*  but you're editing it anyway, Paul, right? So it's like...
*  Yeah, we'll edit all your parts out.
*  So you can get rid of that part and Broker can go back.
*  So let me ask you about these coherent views, because I also felt like that there are different,
*  all these glimpses of consciousness, like the subtitle of your documentary reads,
*  but all these views are very different at the same time. They're very coherent.
*  And they seem to challenge, if not at least question what I call the unholy trinity of
*  mechanistic reductionist materialism. So they all seem to be pointing there and offering a different
*  path that again, I don't think we hear very often in academia, which could go on their different
*  names. I would like you to tell me what you feel about that. Could go on the return to animism,
*  or maybe an embracing of spirituality within science, or simply a pansechist view. Well,
*  there are many ways to express it, but all these glimpses seem to point to the same place.
*  Maybe that was an unconscious peak on your side and then seeing it reflected.
*  I'm just curious about any thoughts you have on why that happened.
*  Yeah, I mean, one of our early ideas when we were still in the concept phase was to
*  pair our protagonists in couples. So we had, because we thought that consciousness is the only
*  subject better in science, or in general, that you can approach from inside as well from outside.
*  And so we try to find protagonists. Like there is the brain scientist who tries to research the
*  brain from outside and the monk who is trying to explore the brain from inside. There is the plant
*  researcher who is trying to do scientific experiments with the cognition of plants.
*  And there is the Mayan plant healer who is communicating with plants in another way.
*  And then there is the psychedelic researcher, Roland Griffiths, who is
*  sending out the psychonauts on trips into the psychedelic universe. And then there is the
*  philosopher who is participating and having this experience from inside. So we have like these three
*  couples in the film. And we thought that there would be also a very contrarian view in the end.
*  And we were surprised ourselves, especially with Christoph Koch, the brain scientist, because we
*  expected him to have a much more materialistic view. And we were very surprised that he came up
*  with this panpsychist view. And with Monika, it turned out that she has also very shamanistic
*  ideas and is not only the lab scientist, not at all. I mean, we knew a little bit about it from
*  her writing, but we were surprised to what degree this is the case that she agrees very much with a
*  holistic and animistic worldview of Indigenous people and actually seeks to collaborate with
*  Indigenous people in her work. So I do have a feeling that there is a new era where science
*  and Indigenous ancient knowledge could approach each other. And that could be a very,
*  I don't know, a very meaningful approach, because I think what also Monika Gagliano always says was
*  missing in science is the view of the sacred or the view of, for example, plants and animals
*  as subjects and not only objects you research. I would, you know, just to confirm,
*  Alex, what Falka said, no, we were very surprised. I mean, when you see a documentary,
*  it all looks like it's sewn up. And, you know, that's, I mean, hopefully that's the process
*  of good editing. We did not expect that at all. And even the phrase or the sentence in there from
*  Max Planck that we used over, you know, I never expected all six of our protagonists or five of
*  them to agree with Max Planck. Max Planck said in 1928, this is the, for people who, I mean,
*  most people will know this, of course, but Max Planck is the father of quantum mechanics. And
*  in 1928, he said that towards the end of his life, he said that
*  he considered conscious to be fundamental in the universe and everything else to be secondary.
*  And, you know, there's a lot of ways to interpret this quote, including what Max Planck actually
*  meant. But, you know, this is a devout, I mean, first of all, an impeccable scientist and material
*  scientist on one hand, and on the second, a devout Christian espousing something which is essentially
*  Hindu, in my mind, more than anything else. But it was a big surprise that, including Mathieu Ricard,
*  who had never heard this quote before, and who was just enamored of this quote, Christophe Kolk had
*  never heard it either. Christophe Kolk, like yourself, originally studied physics, had never
*  heard this from Max Planck. And it was quite, this quote had a sort of a story in itself. But I think,
*  you know, I know in your talks with Rupert Sheldrake, you were talking, he was talking
*  about how many times he had thought that the materialist, the strictly materialist view of
*  science was changing, but in fact, it didn't change. And then it would change again, he thought,
*  and it didn't change. And I still think that it is changing. And I think it's because, in my view,
*  that the materialist view of science isn't leading to the things that we need to be answered, period.
*  And to me, that's why, I mean, and I have an enormous amount of respect for Christophe Kolk,
*  partly because, and in our film, amazingly enough, to my mind, while we were filming him,
*  he concedes that he does not think we are ever going to find the origins of consciousness
*  in the human brain. I mean, now that's quite something to say if you're heading, you know,
*  by far the most expensive research project in neurobiology, or neuroscience.
*  But I think that we're ready, you call it a paradigm shift, I think you could also call it
*  a dialectical shift, because we have to, we I think we could get into this in the podcast as well.
*  I think that that has to shift, or we may not even survive.
*  Let me mention one thing about Kolk, which I truly admire. Of course, he's arguably one of the
*  greatest or most notorious neuroscientists alive. The remarkable thing about Christophe Kolk, I think
*  it's that there is a Christophe Kolk 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. He has changed his mind, but not just his mind,
*  like opinion or theory or approach, his worldview. If you track him over the decades, he's been
*  like nobody I can think of, actually, at that level of notoriety. So I think that reflects,
*  I would say, a degree of honesty that I'm not saying other people don't have, but people,
*  like great figures don't change their mind. And he has, so one wonders.
*  Science changes with one obituary at a time, sort of, with that's Niels Bohr, I think.
*  I admire that about Christophe, frankly, and I'm sure it catches flak for it. But
*  I really appreciated that about him, and also to talk about his own internal conflicts about
*  being raised a devout Catholic and wanting to get, he says it in the film as well,
*  wanting to go into science to disprove science. His brother is also the German ambassador to the
*  Vatican. I didn't know that. Well, we tried to film in the Sistine Chapel, but it didn't come together.
*  But let me share a concern I have with my own way of approaching this, and I'll put it a bit
*  dramatic, but I think it's honest at the same time. So on the one hand, I mean, I'm trying to surf
*  or to walk the fine line between dogmatic orthodoxy, mind is nothing but brain activity.
*  But then to tune it, not to go into too much new agey stuff, like you go from nothing but to anything
*  goes to, you know, from neuron poking to try hugging. Right. And that also has to do with the
*  reception that your film may have had, and also persuasion. I was talking about influence, right?
*  Do you think you're preaching to the choir, or is it, of course, it's high level entertaining,
*  as any documentary probably wants to be? Are you trying to change somebody else's mind? Is
*  it preaching to the choir? How do you navigate that line between both extremes, if you know what I mean?
*  We definitely tried to avoid to be esoteric and new age. So that was one reason why we didn't ask
*  the usual suspects who always talk about spirituality and consciousness and the universe.
*  But we really were looking for very serious and acclaimed scientists for this film. So we wouldn't
*  only approach like the crowd who already believes everything is spiritual. So we wanted really to
*  reach a mainstream audience. And we were very happy that PBS bought the film in the end and
*  broadcast it on a very popular slot, independent lens. So it's not only in this niche of people
*  who are interested in consciousness as a spiritual form. And the same is true in
*  German public television also. Yeah. I know, I would just reiterate that, Alex, is that we tried
*  there. I mean, I went to school at Berkeley and Santa Cruz at the University of California. So
*  the Mecca of new age, you know, I mean, I know what that looks like. And I have an allergic reaction
*  to it and a deep love of science. And I would say in the same breath and an understanding that
*  science is a method and that science is also limited and we've made it more limited than it
*  needs to be, but still a love of science and a historical understanding of what science is.
*  And when it arrives in European history also, which is a critique as well, of course, but
*  when we were trying to get PBS, these two public, big public broadcasters on board,
*  one of the things that we would say is that we want to go into this realm, the investigation of
*  consciousness, holding onto the handrail of science as we go into the ocean of consciousness.
*  Excuse me. And I think that that is really an apt metaphor. The idea and the audience that we're
*  seeking is not the new age. And it's not necessarily people who think that material science
*  has this all wrapped up like billiard balls on the table. I think there's an enormous group of people
*  who are between those points of view. I would say the vast majority of people, as far as I can tell,
*  who you might ask them, they may answer a question with a scientific bias or they might
*  answer it in another more irrational way. But I think that there's an enormous amount of people
*  who are interested in science and the spiritual at the same time. And frankly, I don't find them
*  mutually exclusive. And that's what we tried to bring across in the film. You're hearing my
*  Midwestern accent. It's actually what Monica Galliano, the plant researcher says. Actually,
*  I think it didn't end up in the film, but it's one of her main thesis that one of the main tasks for
*  scientists is returning the soul to science. I'm curious to know how Paul feels about
*  this particular issue. I'm sorry to just- No, good.
*  No, that's fine. Which particular issue? Because I'm more prone to
*  diving into these waters, but I don't know so much what a more, if I can call it that, because I
*  don't really know your views on that, Paul, that a more conservative, orthodox, or less eclectic view
*  than mine. You're asking if I have-
*  I think about the same. Yes. Did you feel comfortable with these views or did they feel like,
*  okay, they're beautiful and honorable, but at some point they're not talking about science?
*  It's more like their way of looking at the world, but that's not proper science as we would.
*  You're constantly talking to, and you're one oneself, but talking to scientists,
*  hardcore scientists. How do you feel about what we're saying?
*  Before I got into graduate school, I was a technician in a neuroscience lab and I got
*  to take a graduate course as a technician. At one point, I raised my hand. I don't know why I did
*  this. I don't know why I felt brave enough to do this. I said, are we maybe not asking the
*  right questions or not understanding what the right questions are or how to frame them?
*  I've always felt like one of the things that this film brings to bear and why it's so comfortable
*  for me to swim in those waters is many of us get into neuroscience because we're interested in
*  solving consciousness and only to realize that it's just forever a mystery. The goalposts are
*  constantly being moved. Then you realize you don't really understand what you mean by the term.
*  So that becomes slippery. I'm very open to the idea of what I think a large part of
*  this project was, for me, from my experience of it, was allowing us to reframe the question
*  or to think about what the question actually is. What are we questioning?
*  I'm probably more conservative than you, Alex, I would imagine.
*  You had a personal experience also that has flavored your own thinking about this.
*  Yes. You're throwing back at me. Thank you for mentioning, for talking about you, Paul.
*  Well, yes, I don't know if you're referring. I had a near-death experience. I don't know
*  if that's what you're referring to, Paul. By the way, death just appears in the documentary
*  as if passing. You could pull it out, right? Because if you're asking about consciousness
*  and consciousness in humans, well, the obvious existential question is what's left of it once
*  our brain and our body dies, right? What does survive, if anything? So death I see also in the
*  movie reflected. And well, yes, I almost died and I saw the tunnel and all of that. It's not that I
*  came back transformed as a new Jesus or anything like that. But this made me wonder many things.
*  What am I going to do with this ticket that says you can run for 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 more years?
*  That happened when I was about to turn 40 years old. So I said, okay, what are you going to do
*  with that time, extra time, overtime? But then, of course, it's back to the nature of the mind.
*  And what Paul was saying, I'm going to generalize. But when neuroscientists, and I asked them, young
*  neuroscientists, when they get into neuroscience, why are you doing this? What was the promise?
*  What do you have inside you? Why are you doing this? What for? And it's either to heal or treat
*  mental disease, you could say, or understand intelligence, cognition, consciousness. All of
*  those things are not the same, but that quickly dissolves and you need to concentrate on getting
*  grants and publishing papers. And it makes sense. But what I mean is if we are studying the brain,
*  it's because it has something very important to do with all these edges of consciousness,
*  as I call them. And those edges are very intriguing to me. And one is new death experiences.
*  Another one is lucid dreaming. Another one could be out of body experiences and so on and so forth.
*  There's this quote from Feynman, the physicist, that says, well, we should study those areas that
*  allow us to prove ourselves wrong as fast as possible. And it feels like even consciousness
*  today that's allowed, it was taboo before the 90s, but now it's allowed as a research field.
*  But still, it feels quite conservative in the type of phenomena that are studied.
*  And what that brings us back, well, sorry for this long kind of monologue, but this brings us back
*  to mystery, which Paul mentioned, it's also in the movie. I don't think consciousness is a cosmic
*  Sudoku to be cracked. I don't think it's an enigma, a problem to be solved. It feels more
*  like a mystery. But what do we scientists do in front of a mystery? It seems like it sounds
*  quasi-religious, but it has to do with that. I think it's a mystery. We can still study it
*  scientifically, but it's more about awe and wonder and not so much about curiosity and being clever
*  about cracking the puzzle, I believe. Yeah. And we've been studying it for 400 years,
*  almost exactly since Descartes, 1630 is the first thing that we know of scientists reflecting on
*  consciousness. And honestly, we haven't gotten very far at all, which I would also say,
*  add an addendum to that, which I think is marvelous, frankly. I think to live in that way,
*  I really also respect, enormously respect Roland Griffiths, who says at the end,
*  isn't this wonderful that it is a mystery. I mean, and hopefully we never solve this because
*  it's the sense of awe, I think is really the key to the spiritual. It's right there. I mean,
*  it's not that I don't want to know. Of course I want to know, but my feeling is that we are not
*  going to know that this is really beyond this. Now, this is purely the world according to Eric
*  Black, but I think that to understand consciousness, it's a little like we're going to have to jump
*  back to some, it's like trying to unite Newtonian physics with quantum physics, that we're not going
*  to figure out how those two things together, unless we find something even grander that unites them.
*  I would also add in what you just said, Alex, is Roland Griffiths and psilocybin, which is
*  another state of mind that is off the charts in terms of how people react, who short of having
*  a near-death experience, which I also had at 40, by the way. But in 700 trips at Johns Hopkins,
*  nearly, what is it? I think it's 70% report that it is one of the five most important
*  experiences of their lives. This is a four to five hour experience in Johns Hopkins,
*  which is one of the most dull looking universities ever imagined, which Roland would say the same
*  thing. And a full 29% say that this experience was the most important experience of their lives,
*  which is just amazing. And these are people who have had no drug experience previously.
*  Now to me, if that doesn't set up a feeling of awe, just that statistic,
*  and these are normal New Jerseyites who are participating in these studies, and yet
*  it's such a universal phenomenon to come back from this experience. And among other things,
*  not being able to even articulate what it is that you have experienced, but knowing
*  that this is something deeply profound. Christoph Koch talks about his own experience in the very
*  beginning of our film as well, amazingly enough, that seems to come from some place else other than
*  the purely materialistic world. I would have a question for you, Alex, regarding the near-death
*  experience. Did this change your worldview as a scientist? Did it feel like a new way of knowing
*  or even knowledge in a scientific sense? Or do you, years after it, maybe see it more
*  like a different type of experience? Yes, these are difficult to answer. I don't think it changed
*  it because I was already going down that path, but it certainly accelerated it or worked as a
*  catalyst, to say, well, what do you have to lose? This is beyond interesting. This is not just
*  interesting, intellectually interesting to contemplate. This is existentially raw and
*  powerful. And so, well, I can do it. I'm paid to ask and try to answer scientific questions. Well,
*  in principle, any phenomenon should be scientifically addressable if you obey by
*  the rules. So why not? I used to study animal behavior, comportamiento, one C. Then you can
*  make the C bigger, cognition. But then there's an even bigger C, which is consciousness. All of a
*  sudden, my focus kind of shift towards, well, that seems to be a big fish. And it's the most
*  intimate that we have anyways. So some people have troubles if you cannot define it and so on, but
*  then they may be zombies. I mean, this is where the humanities and the sciences meet, right?
*  It's a very interesting convergence. And you use the water metaphor, well, or visual image so much,
*  the blue. I wanted to ask you, it's not to defer and go away, but I wanted to ask you about blue
*  and green, because there's a lot of blue and green. Now in the sea where the water meets the sand and
*  the land and the air, well, there is a conjunction there of elements, which I think is also what we're
*  trying to do here. We're trying to talk science, but also inner experience and worldviews.
*  So, well, broken back to your question. It accelerated a path I was already heading towards.
*  And on my everyday life, of course, when I remember that, and I do because I have a big
*  scar from here to here. So every morning, every morning I see it. And well, it makes little moments
*  and glow maybe a little bit different, right? Because I don't want to, it's not dramatic or
*  anything like that. But probably you can have that through other means. As I always joke,
*  you don't need to nearly die to experience that. I have kind of a naive question that maybe you can
*  all reflect on. And that is, so the protagonists in the film are all over a certain age. And
*  you don't find many teenagers coming to have this view of subjective experience that often
*  accompanies getting older and wiser or more reflective. And the question is, why are we
*  so blind to it? Why are younger people often so blind to it? And then why are we also blind to
*  it just on a day-to-day basis? Why do we need meditation? Why do we need psilocybin? Why do
*  we need near-death experiences to come to form this alternative kind of view?
*  Well, I think Gordon Griffiths probably would contradict what you just said, because he says,
*  for example, that the closest people who are living in pure consciousness and the pure moment
*  and the pure being are probably little children. So I don't think you have to be wise.
*  But if you ask a child to what their thoughts are on that experience, they won't be able to
*  rationalize it. Okay, that's different.
*  I mean, I think it has to do, I mean, maybe this is too obvious, but it takes a lot, even as a child,
*  to maintain that type of worldview, let alone express it. I can think of things that now,
*  in retrospect, that happened to me as a child, which I didn't talk about even to my parents,
*  about things that now seem at least semi-mystical, and certainly even the idea
*  that everything was alive. I mean, I remember having this affinity for Native Americans here
*  in the United States when everybody else, it seemed to me, wanted to be cowboys. And
*  things that I simply can't explain, but I think maybe the greatest example of that—now, it's not
*  with children, but if we transpose that to science, what I think is really missing is that
*  scientists themselves are not talking about their experiences. I mean, I'm not talking about what is
*  sometimes called the technicians of science who are doing just the mundane things all day long, but
*  looking at the great discoveries of science, they are so often under extremely odd, I would even say,
*  mystical or spiritual experiences, and yet that isn't talked about because, I mean, we can get
*  into why that is, but—and the beauty of science, I think, is also because in the end, you have to go
*  back and do the work. I mean, you have to—like Monica can have this experience about plants,
*  but unless she does those experiments in her lab, no one's going to take her seriously. And that's—it's
*  the—you know, I do think that that's the beauty of science, is this ability to reproduce an
*  experiment, but how you got the inspiration or the insight to do that experiment is rarely talked
*  about. And when you do go into it, what you find is that an enormous percentage of the great
*  discoveries or the great thoughts in science come from what we would otherwise call mystical
*  experiences, whether it's Einstein on the—you know, on the streetcar, or rather it's Francis
*  Crick on an LSD trip seeing DNA. I mean, how do we explain that? And we don't talk about that.
*  People don't know about it. It's—you hear it sort of casually in the background, but the truth is,
*  this is an ongoing phenomenon, and my feeling is that it's almost the majority of great scientific
*  work is touching on the—I mean, I'm always at a loss for a word, but touching on the spiritual,
*  touching on the divine in some way that is inexplicable even to the scientists themselves.
*  In the 90s in Spain, we had this TV program called Let's Talk About Sex, and of course we
*  came from a dictatorship and whatever, and that was a very popular one. There are things we
*  all like doing, but for some reason we don't want to talk about it. I call this—I've called it
*  recently the Schrödinger's closet, you know, like the cat. It's both that—I mean, many of us live
*  in Schrödinger's closet, which means we kind of—we are dissociated, right? Like we go to work,
*  we wear lab coat, and whatever, we sacrifice as many animals as we need, but then we have these
*  animals at home that we love, or we just—we are rationalists on weekdays, and then
*  I don't know, love to go to the countryside and explore nature and have this kind of quasi-mystical
*  attitude towards the natural world and so on, and we don't tell these stories. When I started telling
*  them, well, some people that you would never think of come and say, you know what, Alex?
*  This also happened to me, or I had this experience, or thanks for saying that because—and you realize
*  it's just out there, but because it's not politically correct, or maybe some people
*  think it has nothing to do with what being a scientist is, as if you could say, well,
*  now I enter the office, I enter the lab, and all my—as if all your—it's like this kind of magic
*  trick, like you put your white coat on and it feels like your personal history, even your
*  metaphysical assumptions, well, I don't have any, right? But we all carry them with us, but those
*  are hidden in Schrodinger's closet, right? And I think, again, documentaries like this one,
*  I can think, I think show to the public that even the most prominent scientists are human beings
*  in that sense. I really think the problem is really this idea, which is, I think, the absolute
*  mainstream idea about science, is that science has to be objective, and I think that that is
*  almost the whole problem because I think there is nothing more subjective than consciousness or the
*  mystery of death or so. I think it's probably impossible to approach this kind of mysteries
*  with only purely objective means. I think it's just excluded.
*  Ralka, I think I've heard you mention that one of the reasons you became interested in this was
*  because of the death of your mother. Am I—
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the second—yeah, that was the second—the first time the idea came up was when we were with
*  the Mayan people, with the film about the Mayan people in Mexico and Guatemala, and then the
*  the ultimate reason why I started to read a lot about consciousness was when my mother died,
*  now actually exactly 10 years ago almost. I think I was so deeply
*  upset, and I just wanted to know if there's any chance that anything survives the physical,
*  bodily death, and so I just read everything I could find of it. Of course, this led also
*  to the idea to research consciousness.
*  Did the making of the film affect you or change your mind, both of you, Erika and Ralka,
*  with respect to—did you find your answer, Christoph?
*  I think the answer—that would be too much, I think, but it definitely
*  deepened my idea that there might be something that survives, and I think I was always,
*  more than to any religious views, I was always drawn to this idea of what many Indigenous
*  people have about the great spirit, which is actually nothing else but the great consciousness,
*  and I find that a very appealing idea that there is not only matter in the universe with
*  no meaning, but that there's also a dimension of spirit and mind, which is in a constant exchange
*  with this matter. I think this makes much more sense to me now, and even after the experience
*  we had with the film, even more. Yeah, I would say, Paul, that definitively not. I do not feel
*  that I have an answer. I think what it really did for me is that it gave me an even deeper sense of
*  awe at being human, being on this planet, being in this universe, and how—you know, it's a place
*  where I feel that words fail me, really, is walking in nature. I think even a more deep respect for
*  nature and the inner connectivity of everything is overwhelming, and at the same time,
*  wonderful. I mean, it reminds me—I have a deep love of the desert, and being an American, we have
*  this incredible desert out there, and it's one of my favorite—for me, it's the most sacred place in
*  my personal repertoire of places to go, is to sit on a butte and have, you know, 100 miles or 150
*  kilometers to yourself alone with a friend, maybe. And that sense of, at the same time, being
*  overwhelmed by where you are. I mean, the American desert has been underwater 17 times. You really
*  see the geology of the planet in front of you. I mean, in the case of the Grand Canyon, certainly,
*  that you go down millions, if not billions, of years. And the way that the stars look at the same
*  time is just—you know, you understand the Maya and why it's called the Milky Way and the vastness.
*  And the fact that you, at the same time, are utterly insignificant in this universe.
*  And it's always the same for me. There's three days—a three-day process where I go out,
*  and the first night is like, oh my God. And by the third day, I'm completely happy in this situation.
*  It's like, I'm insignificant, and isn't this wonderful? And I had the same feeling with this
*  film, is that this is a mystery beyond mysteries, and I'm extremely grateful for this and live in
*  awe of it at the same time. Can I ask you whether you would have included the
*  Chad GPT craziness had you recorded the documentary today? Would this have a place in aware?
*  It may have a place in our next film. Oh, there we go. There's a transition.
*  It is funny because actually, some TV producers asked us when we made aware if we wanted to include
*  artificial intelligence, and we said no. We didn't find that very interesting because I think—and
*  I actually still believe this—that AI doesn't have consciousness because I don't think it has
*  what for us came through as the most simple definition of consciousness is subjective
*  experience. And I mean, there may be as much intelligence as you ever can have, but I don't
*  think, and I'm not sure if it ever will be possible, that an artificial intelligence will
*  have subjective experience and will feel and really perceive from an inside point of view,
*  which is, I think, the key to define consciousness. Alex, this may be a bit of a non-sequitur,
*  but I'm also really struck at the same time with this discussion about AI. And I do understand
*  that it's a real danger, and we can talk about that going back to this dialectic in science,
*  or for whom are we working? But I'm also struck at the same time that we talk about AI so much,
*  and yet there are all of these other systems that are far more intelligent than AI that we
*  don't talk about. I mean, Monica makes a reference in the film calling it BI, is her joke, which is
*  biological intelligence. Well, it is amazing that here we are, you know, talking so much about
*  something that is man-made or human-made. When we really look at
*  forests and tree networks or plants or certainly the mushroom, the network, you know, the world,
*  the wood-wide web, the amount of intelligence that's involved there, or even simply in an
*  elephant or in whales, is also more than astounding, and we seem to be stuck with this idea.
*  I guess what I'm aiming for here is that I do think that there's a shift in general to understand
*  that we may not be the most intelligent thing on the planet. In any case, rather, it's AI or BI,
*  and maybe we better just get used to that and start cooperating more with other forms of intelligence.
*  I mean, AI, I have to say, I don't yet know enough about it, but that I certainly think that
*  cooperating and trying to understand other types of intelligence is also crucial to our survival.
*  But Paul and Alex, I would ask you as neuroscientists, do you believe that AI can become conscious?
*  I'm not qualified enough to say things about AI, but I think it's yes and no. It's no because
*  it's hard to imagine how to imbue that algorithm with the intrinsic perspective that you were
*  talking about. I don't think it has it. I'm not sure where it's coming from. At the same time,
*  I tend towards this animistic spectrum of, I mean, I'm not appalled by certain ideas of panpsychism.
*  I believe that the world is ensouled. So in that respect, I think that AI is a very important
*  tool. In that respect, and of course, the usual debunkers will kick the stone like Johnson did
*  for Berkeley and say, so that thing is conscious. Alex, stupid conversation stopper. I think more
*  subtle views can be made, but experiential views can be made concrete. That's why I'm saying yes
*  I think consciousness or mind, which is not the same thing, but anyways, it's most likely a
*  fundamental principle of the cosmos. But I don't think that these machines that we're talking about
*  today are going to be able to have a lot, if any, consciousness. I was asking that. Well, I also
*  want to hear what Paul has to say. And then I want to ask you about human and human extinction and
*  transhumanism, because that's maybe a crossroads where these leads, right? Where are we going to
*  bet our money? Are we going to bet our money that the future human is the cyborg or are we going to
*  bet our money that the future human is like the shaman, right? Back to the forest. But first,
*  what do you think, Paul, about AI? Because you speak to a lot of very knowledgeable people
*  about these matters. No. But seriously, like that, I'm open. The problem with me is the question,
*  which assumes that we know what we're talking about. And if we don't know what we're talking
*  about, how are we going to judge something that we build? So to me, there's a problem with the
*  framing of the question, which assumes a sort of definition that we all know what we're talking
*  about. And like, well, I'll just leave it at that, to be brief. Because I don't want to take us over
*  time either. But no, the current machines, not subjectively aware. And I don't think it's,
*  I think this kind of technology is missing fundamental principles that would be needed
*  for a subjective experience. I have a question for Alex, if I may. And that is, and this was
*  leading up to something that you were talking with Rupert Sheldrake. And that is the assumption on
*  the part of scientists, and I put the assumption in big letters there, that all the answers will be
*  found through a material understanding of material, basically. And that why is that? Why is that?
*  Why it's not only that we're afraid, but we mean, addressed that way, it seems to me, it really gets
*  at the crux of the matter. It's an assumption. And it's a such in which we hold so tightly.
*  And yet, and I'm talking about scientists, maybe the society in general, but scientists in particular,
*  that we hold on to the science, we ridicule people who do not share it, even when we know
*  that there's this other side, or, you know, things are not what they seem, especially after quantum
*  physics. And yet, it's still why is that? What is that serving? Is that part of the underpinnings
*  of corporate capitalism that we're looking at? Is that what we're really looking at right there? Is
*  that we can't talk about these things because it affects the underlying economy to everything we do?
*  Yeah, that's a fascinating question. I think there are many layers. I'll summarize, at least,
*  as deep as I think I can go. We've been told that science is synonymous with materialism.
*  As if I make like two joints that now are one, and you can only move your arm like this, right?
*  Like you can't be a scientist if you're not a materialist, right? But materialism is a
*  metaphysics. So here, science is confounded with philosophy. And we're given reason for that. Of
*  course, if I hit my head, if I damage my gray matter, whatever, my consciousness will perhaps
*  not show up. By the way, we can talk about other ways of conceiving that very same piece of data
*  through a model of brain that it's not productive of consciousness, but permissive of consciousness,
*  like William James said more than a hundred years ago. But we just don't want to listen to that.
*  Just leaving that aside. So there's the first, well, a first layer. And science equals materialism,
*  first trick. But I think that equation is written because it comes from a previous step, which is
*  materialism equals atheism. And I think that comes from secular humanism. So it's a deep
*  kind of historical, political, and maybe even theological rabbit hole. It's this idea of,
*  well, we're sick of religion. And so there's no God and no purpose, no final causes, no consciousness,
*  just matter, matter, matter, matter. And that's how scientists are going to do it. Now, the irony
*  here is that all of the sciences look back at physics as they want to be like physics. But then
*  when it's time to be like physics, they ignore perhaps the greatest highlights of physics,
*  which happened a hundred years ago, which is that, and I know that's one possible interpretation of
*  quantum mechanics, but that in looking into these building blocks, okay, let's go for matter, matter,
*  we realize that perhaps matter is made of mind. Because when we try to, I always make this metaphor
*  like the Truman show, when Jim Carrey is just, you know, wants to escape, he doesn't know it's
*  all made up and he takes the boat and they turn on the storm and then he nearly drowns and swims,
*  and then he reaches to the dome, right? I think that's what happened to physics a hundred years
*  ago. Now, molecular biology comes in, they want to be like physics, you know, actually in a way
*  spurred by some thoughts of notorious physicists, as you know, but then it's like, no, no, no,
*  we're going to ignore one of the, if not the biggest insight we got from physics, are we going
*  to pretend everything is made of billiard balls, right? But so back to your question, which is a
*  very deep one. It's like scientism, materialism, atheism. And so you can only work like this,
*  right? There's no freedom to explore other worldviews, which is again what your documentary
*  opens the door to as entertaining. Well, and the social sciences try to be like the hard
*  scientists, sciences also. Yeah. I think your science today could be in a similar position
*  as quantum physics a hundred years ago in the other way around. Pursuing mind, believing it's
*  inside the skull. Well, maybe they can both meet and then maybe we can heal that really
*  horrible marriage between mind and matter, right? And of course, another trick, another trick,
*  I like detecting all those tricks. Maybe I'm incorrect, but it's like a two alternative
*  force choice, the kind of things we ask our rodents to do in the lab, which is you're now
*  going to pick between dualism or physicalism. And we all know dualism is stupid. Therefore,
*  that's your only option, right? No, it's not so fast, right? There are more cards on the table.
*  And that's why every time I love reading and reviewing books, especially if neuroscientists
*  talking about consciousness and it's very patent when you read and I can name some of them because
*  they've written it, Antonio D'Amacio, they're great scientists and Neil Seth and so on. There's
*  always a part in the book when they need to straw man panpsychism, right? They just can't stand it
*  because the business is set up so that you have dualism for dummies, for stupid people,
*  and here you have the only real thing, which is physicalism, right? Well, that's philosophical
*  ignorance, I must say. And I stop here. I fire up. I'll stop here. Well, Alex, to keep him fired up.
*  Oh, no, no, no, I understand it that what you are looking for and hoping to teach and
*  who I mean, it's limited what I know about what you're doing, but you're seeking to form a new
*  science of consciousness. How do you propose? I mean, I'm all for it, but I'd like to hear a
*  little about your ideas about doing it. Ah, because I think it's way overdue is my my feeling.
*  Hmm. Well, we need theories, of course, but I don't think we need the kind of theories
*  out there. And the word theory means many things for many people. I have great respect for
*  integrated information theory, and people seem to be very pissed off, but at least,
*  and this is one important thing of Tononi's theory, they start from concrete experience.
*  So they don't, I think it's Christophe Coq who makes this analogy between turning the water
*  of the brain into the wine of consciousness. I don't think that can be done. You need and he
*  knows that, right? Maybe he also means that you need to start with the wine. What we have
*  firsthand experience, immediate experience, is the experience of the world, that this is this is
*  consciousness, right? And from it, we, we can say things about the world. So it's like flipping the
*  problem upside down. I think then if consciousness is a given, then we need to explain matter and
*  the structures we find in the world. So we swap certain questions for certain answers. So we need
*  theories. The other thing I think we need is to explore what I was saying, these edges of
*  consciousness. Those, I call them edges in two senses. First, because they're marginalized.
*  People don't want to talk about that. And because it's whatever. And then they use all these
*  prefixes. These prefixes are also tricks, like, like the ones I was telling you. This is pseudo
*  science is super natural. It's parapsychological, right? They throw in all these conversation
*  stoppers hidden in the prefixes, right? So the edges of consciousness, because they're
*  marginalized, but also because they offer these, maybe these, it's like in physics, a hundred years
*  ago with when a few important details didn't, didn't add up. And it's just by poking those
*  details that you discovered a big surprise, right? So I would say,
*  being more free to study scientifically those edges and the first person experience. That's why
*  I've been having all these conversations about the future scientist and now the future human.
*  How is the future scientist going to look like? Is he or she going to look more like
*  a computer scientist or maybe more like a poet? We don't know.
*  I think that that's highly political, honestly, that I don't think that you can separate it out
*  from the rest of society. And, and, you know, and, and certainly with climate collapse,
*  rather, we're going to survive. I mean, I, I, because we're, we're studying that so much right
*  now. I wanted to ask both of you, Alex and Paul, if you, this is something, you know, we're thinking
*  about looking into for our own third part. I mean, there are many parts of the third part
*  of the trilogy and we're really just investigating, but one is that, um, sciences scientists that are
*  researching the consciousness of, of the planet, of the biosphere, you know, of course there's
*  James Lovelock and his partner who I'm always forgetting. And we actually tried to interview
*  him right before he died, but, um, or experiments or people who are looking at the universe
*  to ask questions about rather they see any evidence of the universe itself being consciousness.
*  No, it's a selfish questions on my part, but things that we would be particularly interested in.
*  Mm.
*  Nobody jumps to mind for me, but again, I would, I just have this question, like,
*  why does it need to be a single thing, like consciousness, as if it's the same
*  for every, it's either on or off, right? Or the earth has to be conscious, like a person has to
*  be conscious, like a bee has to be conscious. And I just don't think that those are likely,
*  that there's one kind of consciousness, essentially.
*  Well, I'm not, I'm not sure that what I said implies that though, Paul, also. I mean, I,
*  you know, especially, I mean, we did do a whole sequence on, on beehives that never made it into
*  the film and my God, that's incredibly fascinating, but you're right. I mean, it's such a,
*  it's so different that it's hard to wrap your, well, it's all hard to wrap your head around,
*  but bee consciousness is infinitely fascinating as well.
*  Yeah, I don't think it's also meant as an entity of consciousness. I think it's all about
*  this thinking of systems and interconnectivity and interconnections. I mean, if you go from the plant,
*  you come to the, the mycelium network under the ground, you come to the forest, they come
*  to the biosphere, you come to the CO2 photosynthesis and the whole system that somehow
*  regulates itself. I mean, as James Lovelock assumed, so it's more like this to think about this,
*  for example, Earth, planet as a system of interconnected relations. And I think this is
*  more what we're thinking about for, for our next project, which also in the direction,
*  how could there be a solution for the climate crisis by thinking more in this way of cooperation
*  and interconnectivity? And somehow that is the logical consequence of our first film on the
*  Mayan people who are also trying to defend their environment and their surrounding from destruction
*  and the research into what is consciousness and aware. I think that would be the logical
*  continuation and we are still totally in the development phase of this.
*  I would say going, going to other places in space, especially drawing from indigenous knowledge,
*  is, is absolutely key and not to be seen only as, oh, how, again, how interesting, how cute,
*  look at those myths, because that's how we tend to watch it. I mean, I speak for myself, like
*  Europeans, right? Wide Europeans. Oh, look at these guys. Isn't it amazing? How funny. No.
*  Indigenous knowledge and see if we have any chance. It's like an umbel problem. You see,
*  Paul, when we speak about the umbels of different animals, well, I think we have
*  umbels within our own species as humans, right? How can we, you know, our own meaningful
*  environment or our own meaningful worlds, how can we push them together so that perhaps they
*  overlap and we can have some glimpses again of what the indigenous person, how the indigenous
*  person is perceiving the rain, right? Something as simple as the rain. That's one thing. I would say,
*  go in space and go in time because again, something happened, right? Eric, you were mentioning it's
*  political, it's political, it's sociological, it's economical, it's theological, it's many things.
*  Something happened and maybe, maybe, I mean, 500 years ago, we didn't have the mind-body problem,
*  as I recall. We had other problems. In a way, I think we've created certain problems that we
*  can solve and that just keeps the, this golem going, right? And we've turned this into habits
*  and we think we cannot think otherwise. So apart from answering questions, I always have great joy
*  in deconstructing the questions, right? And like even the formulation of the heart problem,
*  forgive me, like how is it that the brain gives rise to mind or consciousness? Well, excuse me,
*  like if that was a journalist, you don't ask me that question. That's an ill-posed question
*  because you're forcing me to assume the premise in your question. I refuse. Like if that was a
*  jury, you know, you would say, no, just replace the question because you're making me answer
*  what you want already in the question, right? So I think there's a certain amount of rewinding
*  in space and time and maybe finding what happened and from there, maybe sew it back together.
*  I also think, Alex, that I, you know, I, for me, the origin of rationality and science and I,
*  for me, I start with Descartes because it's an easy place to put the pin. You know, it's right
*  after we burned all the witches, right? It's right after the Inquisition. And those two things are
*  absolutely joined. I mean, we don't like to think of them that way, but we got rid of all of this
*  sort of extraneous spirituality in order to go into science. I mean, that's the way it looks
*  in retrospect, but we got rid of this perspective. We got rid of our, in the case of Europeans,
*  we got rid of our indigenous people, we got rid of our Cudenderas, and then we went on this voyage
*  into science at the same time. And it's definitely the downside of science,
*  is that understanding that history, that these are not coincidences.
*  Yes. You implied, Paul, that there's something I wanted to ask that I haven't...
*  You wanted to ask, I think about, I think I remember you saying maybe extinction and the future.
*  Yes. Yes, that was tied to the AI fuss. But without the AI fuss, it belongs to aware, right?
*  Because it's asking, you see, we were talking about death and what survives, but you can ask
*  that question at a personal level, what will survive of me when I die? But what about us as humans?
*  So as a species. I guess, Alex, I'm not quite sure what your question is.
*  I'm asking about the future of humanity. That's a simple question.
*  Answer it. Yeah.
*  No, but let me tie it back. Do you do this as a multiple choice test?
*  Yes. Yes. The possibilities are going well, going bad, prefer not to answer.
*  No, but look, let me give some context of why I'm asking this. There's this narrative where,
*  and I've heard it many times and I've even said it myself, I flicker. Oh, we humans are this fucking
*  virus on earth. Look what we're doing. We're doomed. We're stupid and so on.
*  But you could also say, isn't it amazing? We love each other and we do the best we can with our
*  families and we try to be kind. A more human is not in a naive, optimist way, but a more like
*  an inherent way. We can forgive and we can hope. And so I think that's also within the spectrum of
*  open. And so I think that's also within the spectrum of talking about consciousness. Maybe
*  this brings us far away from science, but nevertheless, an AI seems to be, or transhumanism
*  seems to be the voice that says, don't worry. We'll just hook you up to a machine. Everything
*  will be fine. And whatever it remains of you, it's going to be great. The upgrade. Look, let me,
*  okay, let me phrase it in another way. Matrix. If evolution happened, which happened, and
*  something evolved into us, what are we going to evolve into? That's the question I don't
*  hear asked because it sounds like, wait, wait, well, but what are we going to turn into as humans?
*  Do you think? Well, I think we are sort of on a, what do you say, cross ways? Crossroads?
*  Crossroads. That's what I wanted to say. Because I mean, I'm at the moment, Eric and I, we are both
*  reading a book by James Bridle, Ways of Being. It's about machines, plants, animals, and planetary
*  intelligence. Yeah. Which I find very interesting because one of the thoughts in the book is that
*  everything that brought us into this crisis is a certain way of thinking. I mean, you could call it
*  the ego thinking or the psychopath thinking, or even the fact that almost all AI is programmed
*  and designed to work for big corporations. I mean, if it's Google or Facebook or big oil companies
*  or whatever, and nobody really tries to recruit these resources of science and developing an AI
*  for the good of the planet or for cooperating with nature, for interconnection,
*  for dissolving the ego, for dissolving the greed. I think this will actually decide about the future
*  of humanity, which path you choose or we choose. Yeah. I would say also, Alex, that it seems to me
*  more and more that the elephant in every conversation anymore is corporate capitalism.
*  That we cannot deal with all the problems. I mean, let's just stick with climate collapse,
*  which I think we're looking at very... I mean, today's paper just looked like it's happening
*  even more rapidly also in Spain than anybody ever predicted. But the point is over and over is that
*  especially reflecting on this in the United States is that now we're back to a point
*  from the 1920s on progressive taxation. The wealthier are more wealthy than they've been
*  forever in this country. And there's a huge lack of democracy. And
*  I don't want to belittle the point, but unless we can get that under control, it seems to me that
*  that's really primary, rather it's in the sciences with the dialectic about materialism, or rather
*  what decisions are being made, rather we're going to go try to make Mars into a beautiful planet
*  when we can't even get this one back on track, that we don't even talk about carbon sequestering,
*  which is to me should be on the top of everybody's mind because if we don't get carbon under
*  control, there is no future. But these decisions are not being made by us. I think that that's,
*  and that's the same problem as AI, it's that it's being developed by Google and Microsoft and these
*  other corporations, not with the idea right from the beginning that this is for the public good.
*  I mean, it sounds so cliche, but the problem is that it is cliche. It is being done for the profit
*  of corporations, for the more money to the extreme wealthy, and less and less choice and ability to
*  make decisions for the rest of us. And I think that that is the crux of the matter on all of
*  these discussions anymore. And you start to sound like a broken record, I realize, but the problem is
*  that is the problem, really. We know how to deal with climate change. We could initiate things
*  tomorrow about climate change that would make radical differences. That information isn't
*  reaching people, rather it's, well, I mean, the most obvious thing to me, and I just think,
*  especially for young people who need something to do to make, you know, to keep this planet habitable,
*  apparently 51% of all carbon is generated in the production of meat, the production and
*  transportation of meat. Well, that's not talked about. Why, how can that possibly be that we're
*  not talking about that front and center? Whether you want to be vegetarian or not, you need that
*  fact to even think about what's happening to your planet. Is it worth all of this? Is it worth
*  giving up everything that we love for this? Again, when I talk about this, I feel like I'm on a
*  diatribe, and yet I feel like someone really has to say this loud and clear, particularly to young
*  people who are getting so much misinformation. And unfortunately, I think that AI, which has the
*  capacity to do wonderful things, is not going to make the situation better at all, to the contrary,
*  because of the way that was set up in the first place. So what are we going to tell our kids,
*  that we didn't know, that we're helpless, that this thing happened while we weren't aware,
*  and now it's too late. Plus, I have a gap there because my older daughter is seven,
*  and perhaps my youngest friend is 33. I have no clue what's going on between seven and 33.
*  I don't even know what they want. We may think that they need this and that, but
*  these young people we're talking about, I don't know what they want, what they need, what they
*  hear, and also what they will tell us. And we'll say, well, did you know that this was happening
*  20 years ago, 10 years ago, and what did you do? And again, I think this carries right over into
*  the sciences too. They're not immune to this at all. So how can we as scientists or as film
*  producers or as outreach, what can we do? I don't usually like the, let's find five
*  bullet points and go home satisfied and we're going to make change, right?
*  No, I don't mean that.
*  But well, perhaps at least conversations like these can bring awareness. If you're moving
*  movies aware, can bring these things on the table and who knows who will solve them or how,
*  but at least we need to, like that TV program, right? At least we need to talk about sex.
*  Right.
*  At least we need to talk about it because if we don't talk about it, well,
*  things happen and we don't realize.
*  And then Spain got Almodovar after that.
*  You see?
*  You see?
*  No. So there is hope.
*  Yeah. And I do think that there is a general audience that wants to be aware of these things.
*  I can only say we never got so many letters and emails ever for any film as for aware after it
*  was broadcast, for example. It was amazing how many people, totally strangers wrote like, wow,
*  this film really changed my life. I see the world with different eyes now. And I mean, I'm sure you
*  can do something with your science as well. I mean, that just changes people's worldview,
*  changes people's mind as long as there are some scientists like you who insist there is not only
*  matter and there are maybe other things to consider. That is already something. I mean,
*  I could imagine, I mean, it sounds like you could really cooperate with Monika. I mean,
*  researching the plant world and you research maybe the animal or the human world. And I think there
*  could be big synergies in all different directions. You know, one of the things that I'm just so
*  impressed with was the integrity of some of these or all of the scientists in our film. I mean,
*  I, Monika, I mean, to stand up to the type of ridicule that she got, you know, and do these
*  very basic experiments and hold to them and also talk about where these ideas came from in a way
*  that's absolutely upset other biologists in the extreme. I mean, as she says in the film,
*  they didn't say that my science was wrong. They said this cannot be true.
*  The other person who really has affected me personally enormously is Roland Griffiths,
*  who is a consummate scientist in the material world. And yet, what really changed his mind was
*  Buddhism. We didn't know this. And also to answer your question from before, we had no idea that
*  Roland was a Buddhist when we started out. And I, you know, personally, he's had an enormous effect
*  on me personally. And I think he's had an enormous effect on the whole world. I mean, in the United
*  States alone, there are 100 cities contemplating decriminalizing psilocybin. Now,
*  when we started this film, you could never have convinced me of that. Never. And yet, simply
*  keeping his integrity and his vision throughout, he was being observed by 11 different
*  federal agencies. I mean, you can imagine the first person to be able to research psilocybin
*  since Nixon, what that would take in terms of having this enormous amount of integrity as a
*  scientist to be able to get that through. And also with what's incredible about Roland, I find too,
*  is his modesty at the same time, his humility. And I think he's moved the world a step in the
*  right direction as a scientist, very much as a scientist, as did Monica. And I would even say
*  that in the case of Christophe Koch, his ability to admit conflicting opinions simultaneously,
*  I think is brave. I mean, I really do. I find that that has an enormous amount of integrity for me.
*  And we need to hear more of this. He has pretty good job security, though, as well. He does.
*  But on the other hand, he has 300 scientists working under him. And to say something like that,
*  I mean, I'm sure he did not. That didn't just go over perfectly well in the Allen Brain Institute
*  when he said it. It'd be a lot easier not to have said it. Yeah, there are all these soft,
*  they're not even soft skills, but you mentioned all these temperamental qualities, right? Like
*  humility and creativity. I mean, we should cherish them more instead of selling this image
*  of a scientist as this kind of humble hubris. Like, well, we don't know, but we know in the end,
*  just give us more funding. We'll crack it. And also the cancelling aspect, I think it's vital.
*  Like all these flowers growing. And the moment you see the flower growing, you go and step on it.
*  Perhaps the case of Monica is one of them, right? Like, look at this beautiful flower. Okay,
*  step on it. The cancelling cannot go on in society, nor even worse in science, I would say.
*  But at the same time, the victim mentality doesn't help, right? Because it's the situation where
*  you're the victim and this is the perpetrator. And to add another layer to it, we've mentioned a bit
*  of ethics, but we haven't mentioned aesthetics. Maybe that's too late. But you see, a different
*  look. I have a philosopher friend who told me, maybe he was teasing me, but he said, look,
*  I go to these meetings, I meet poets, I meet artists, I meet scientists. Well, the scientists
*  are the most boring of all. And he says, and that's going to sound like an insult to perhaps some
*  listeners, but if they're materialists, they're quite boring and their aesthetics is quite dull.
*  What I'm trying to say is that there are other worldviews and we can choose. And some choices
*  entail different ethics and different aesthetics. Like, if you imagine that the universe is just
*  like inert, unconscious, dull billiard balls bouncing on each other for no reason,
*  the color, it's quite different than if you think it's teeming with life and purpose and so on.
*  Right. So we could also say, well, I pick the second one and it's not just, I pick what I
*  prefer and then I'll try to make the science fit into it. Of course, science also guides you. But
*  there are these choices of worldviews. And for some reasons, and we've mentioned a few, if you
*  try to push forward certain worldviews, they're squashed as not scientific enough. That's truly
*  unfair and we need those views, I think. I would add too, and very strongly, that I don't think
*  that materialist science is holding up. I mean, it's not simply a matter of we're going to choose.
*  It's unable to answer many, many things and it does many things extremely well, as we know,
*  and we could list them all day long. But it is a method in the end. And people need to remember
*  that it is a method. It is not a religion. Sometimes it seems like it, but it is a method
*  which has capabilities like any other method. Yeah. There are two books I also wanted to,
*  you probably know them both anyway, but I just started this, which is Michael Streven's
*  The Knowledge Machine, How Irrationality Created Modern Science. I assume you know this book, but
*  I don't know that it holds up to scrutiny. And I enjoyed this enormously, I would say.
*  And I asked Roland Griffiths about his opinion of that. He goes,
*  yeah, I'm all over this, he said. Now this is his view as well, which is a case for the humanities
*  being as important as the sciences and in terms of integrating this entire worldview back to us.
*  So I started the Future Scientist series with this new one by Jeff Kreipel, the superman.
*  That's his new, I strip off the covers of the book. I like them like this. So yes, this is even a
*  stronger case. It's a case for the superhumanities.
*  Okay, I'll read it. I love the flip. Yeah, I actually put my covers back on so I could
*  show you them. So I guess I lose. So Paul, how do we start wrapping this up?
*  Well, everywhere, we've gone everywhere.
*  I mean, I don't know, we can just kind of naturally wrap it up. But I was going,
*  you know, Frohka, you were saying that you had never heard from so many people receive so many
*  emails and letters of appreciation from the movie Aware. And you have both said that you were careful
*  not to go woo woo or too mystical with the film, which you did a great job of, by the way. But did
*  you receive any backlash from people who thought, well, you know, the physical sciences
*  do have something to say, you know, and you, you know, did you receive any backlash that maybe you
*  were presenting a even though, you know, you intended to have multiple different stories,
*  and you said that they kind of converged into one and a unified view. But did anyone disagree
*  with that unified view and say, Oh, you're doing a disservice to science? Not so much.
*  Actually, I think we had enough hard science in the film to please the fans of science. I mean,
*  because actually, almost all the protagonists are scientists, and they actually do real experiments
*  in real universities and real laboratories. So this aspect is not missing in the film, actually,
*  it's a main part. So actually, no, and I can't think of any, actually.
*  But one of the messages is that what the film deepens the mystery, and it makes it deeper
*  instead of bringing it closer to a solution, which is a, you know, very scientific.
*  And actually, I agree with Monica, what she says at the end of the film that the mechanistic view
*  is dying, and we need a more unified view. And I think that's what we were trying to
*  support. Yeah. So I see where Paul is going. So let me insist a bit on this point to be
*  not even critical with you, but you could say, well, you can always speak those hardcore scientists
*  that are going to deliver the message that's delivered in the movie, right? But, and I really
*  like the pair with pair with pair, right? Brain from within, mind from within, and then
*  looking at the plant from the outside, from the inside and psychedelic. So there's this,
*  also this nice symmetry, like you spoke about the six characters in pairs and so on. But what would
*  have happened? Maybe that's a bad choice as a film director, if you would, and you said, well,
*  you didn't expect they would converge. If you had five plus one dissident, you know, like a minority
*  report, but from the orthodox view, if one of the characters was somebody just sticking and saying,
*  no, it's all made by the brain and there's no mystery. And how would that, if you're cooking
*  a dish, what would that ingredient have done to the meal? Because that ingredient is in a way,
*  it's not in the documentary. The six main figures are all going in one direction. And if you didn't
*  reply any, if you didn't receive any complaints, let's put it this way, that's fine. But you could
*  have easily had, and I'm sure Paul has interviewed many of them, and he would say, well, no, I
*  actually, I actually am looking completely the other way and these are my reasons and these are
*  my data. And you see? And I know what you are aiming at. And actually, we did expect Christophe
*  Koch to have a much more pure materialistic view than he did at the end. So actually, he was our
*  materialist scientist we planned for and that he opened up to all these other, to show all his
*  other sides. That was actually a surprise to us. But it's also true, at least from my side,
*  that I would find some purely materialistic views really boring. I mean, I really,
*  I, it's like a little bit like with AI, I wouldn't know where it would lead to, because obviously,
*  materialistic science hasn't answered the question of consciousness. So we were looking for people
*  who were at least open to look into all sorts of directions and not have just a one-sided view.
*  This is just produced by neurons and that's it. So that is, of course, a choice we did.
*  We weren't expecting that from Roland Griffiths either. But also, I think, you know, what I hear
*  is that, of course, you can go find scientists who say that, you know, the brain is simply a
*  computer made out of meat. I mean, we've all heard this, right? Well, frankly, I find that
*  really stupid. I mean, I really do. I mean, I, and it's saying in the future, we will find this. Well,
*  I don't think that's good science, frankly. You know, I, you know, these prophecies about what
*  science is going to find or not going to find, I mean, how many times have we broken that mold?
*  You know, starting with Max Planck, who was really himself trying to seal up
*  Newtonian physics. And at the same time, you know, in the 1890s in Berlin, in Germany,
*  physicists were telling their students, don't continue in physics. We're going to have this
*  all sewn up by the turn of the century. And then Max Planck comes around and he thought the same
*  thing. I mean, it's only thanks to Max Planck's integrity that he didn't even falsify his data,
*  because everything he thought he was doing, he thought even, you know, even 20 years later,
*  he was trying to put Pandora back in the box. It wasn't someone who thought, oh, my God, isn't this
*  great? I've discovered quantum physics. It was quite the opposite. Anyway, I mean, it's often
*  been said. So I'm always very skeptical of hearing prophecies about what science is going to discover,
*  because the beauty of science is that it's practically never that.
*  Yes, and that's your choice, right? In a way, so you choose whoever you want to have in your
*  documentary totally. I was just trying to imagine how would it look if one would still man the
*  absurdity of that position. And I've been very critical with promissory materialist. I call it
*  promisomics. It's just, it's always conditional and future, right? But perhaps there could have been
*  in a parallel universe in another documentary. I figure that embodies that.
*  We did expect this with Koch, actually. It depends on, as you say, which day you talk to him.
*  Yeah. Alex, let me see if I can start to wrap this up by maybe bringing us back to the beginning.
*  So, and the intention that you had in having this conversation in the first place.
*  One of the things that the film does really well or did really well for me is highlight and
*  celebrate a reverence and sense of awe for the mystery that is subjective experience.
*  And it's great that it does so through the lens of veritable scientists and thinkers and so on.
*  And Alex, I mean, one of the reasons why you wanted to have this conversation was because
*  of the possibility and the role of things like documentaries to the sciences and what kind of
*  allowing the documentary, in this case, to kind of swim and let your imagination swim in those
*  waters for a while and whether that will have an effect on your science. Do I have that right,
*  first of all, in what you're thinking? And then, I don't know, maybe you can just reflect on that
*  after having had this conversation. Yes, that's a good way to wrap it up.
*  And so, of course, science provides material to the arts, but I'm very interested in how the arts
*  can be used by scientists and the general people, the people too. But like some,
*  what strikes me is that some of these conversations are really hard to have in seminar rooms,
*  even in places where you're studying consciousness. Now, well, you sit down and watch a documentary,
*  it feels like you shut down some defenses, some filters, and you let the colors, we haven't spoken
*  about the visuals of it, right? But these images of the water with the sun being reflected,
*  they're quasi-psychedelic, right? So they put you in an emotional state and in a state of mind
*  that allows to entertain certain ideas. And I think that's very powerful. Again,
*  it's not just entertainment, entertainment in the sense of just relaxing. I see documentaries,
*  they have this potential. And of course, science fiction does this all the time.
*  They're kind of in the future. They just bring things, we're still not ready to talk in seminar
*  rooms. And they make it accessible and touchable by anyone. And well, that's what I propose, Paul,
*  we could do. We could talk to some people that film these beautiful documentaries and there's
*  others in the list. And there's a dial there, some can go more, you know, flaky and others can go more
*  and more stubbornly dogmatic. But in any case, the arts, the point is that the future scientists,
*  I think, will need the arts, not as a hobby. And that's why I mentioned the poet and so on.
*  I'm kind of imagining like this branching of science and philosophy and the humanities and
*  the arts needs to just coincide at some point in the near future. Otherwise, I'm not sure how we're
*  going to make it. Well, I wanted to say something too, is that, you know, of course you see this
*  both through your own filters and rightfully so. I think for me, as important as anything else,
*  and I think this is what Alex is partially hitting on, is that really above all else for me,
*  this film was meant as a provocation. You know, you have 90 minutes, which is nothing, you know,
*  if you're writing a book or it's very little time. And the provocation was to have people
*  investigate consciousness for themselves. And it's meant to take you, yes, it is meant to be,
*  put you on a voyage. But it's, as you both pointed out, it doesn't give you answers,
*  and we don't expect answers. But in the end, what we want people to do is take their own voyage and
*  not listen to us, you know, to really be open to these experiences, these
*  other types of consciousness, if that's a good word. And it always, I always come back to,
*  and this is really new age, you'll have to forgive me, but is Krishnamurti,
*  who after everybody tried to pigeonhole him, he's a was a Indian guru who, I mean, incredible
*  history, but he said, and I'm paraphrasing, he said, if you find a path in the spiritual woods,
*  don't take it. It's not yours. You have to make your own. And I, to me, that is the,
*  you know, one of the main, the keys to this film is not giving an answer. It's a provocation.
*  I think that's well said. Well, guys, Frauke and Alex, I know it's very late for you. I appreciate
*  you staying up late. And Frauke and Eric, thanks for having this conversation, taking the time.
*  I'm glad we finally made it happen. Thank you. Thank you, Paul, for doing this and setting this
*  up. And very good question. I really enjoyed this conversation. And the only thing I could add is
*  because Alex, you said you would like to invite the arts into the world of science. But I think
*  also to, you talked about, will humans become a cyborg or a shaman or will the scientists become
*  a cyborg or a shaman? And I think, I mean, I would tend to the shaman. I mean, I would tend
*  to have scientists who are also open for a dialogue with the natural world of subjects instead of
*  trying to examine objects. I actually had on, you know, Alex, how we have to, you know, like those
*  30 second or two minute where you have one slide thing, what is called lightning rounds, where you
*  have to present what you do. I had in my future cyborg from studying consciousness at the beginning,
*  and then there were some stages and then I was a cyborg. So maybe I'm not the shaman or maybe
*  I'll change my tune. Well, thank you guys for the conversation. Thank you, Paul.
