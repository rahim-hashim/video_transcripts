# BI 094 Alison Gopnik: Child-Inspired AI
**Brain Inspired:** [January 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbDMu7HcFus)
*  When we actually look at what kids do, what we see is that from the time that they're
*  very, very young, even infants, they seem to have this kind of abstract structured knowledge
*  of the world around them. But they also seem to be modifying, changing, revising, altering
*  that structure in the light of the data that they see. That's not the only kind of phenomenology.
*  There's also just the phenomenology of being richly in the world and experiencing everything
*  that's going on around you. And I think there's good reason to believe that that kind of phenomenology
*  is more like what you're seeing in children. When do I just give up and when do I keep
*  going? And what's the answer? What's the answer? Well, for what it's worth. And now
*  that I'm an old person, I can say this, I tell my students.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Did Alan Turing have it right when he suggested that we make AI that emulates a child instead
*  of what many of us think of as quote unquote intelligent, namely us adults? Hey everyone,
*  it's Paul. So Alison Gopnik has thought for a long time that Turing was right. And these
*  days she's taking what we know about how children learn and trying to apply it to improve some
*  of the shortcomings of today's AI. Alison runs her lab at Berkeley and she's the author
*  of many books like The Scientist in the Crib, The Philosophical Baby, and most recently
*  The Gardener and the Carpenter, all of which are about topics related to child development,
*  children's minds and how they work, and in The Gardener and the Carpenter, the relationship
*  that we as parents and adults have with children. Of course, in child development science, there's
*  the perpetual question of what knowledge and skills we're born with, that is, what's
*  innate versus what we learn, also known as nativism versus empiricism. And that's a
*  debated topic in AI also these days, how much bias and structure to build into AI models
*  versus the current trend of training them from tabula rasa states. And we talk about
*  that a little and we discuss how the massive learning engine that we're born with goes
*  to work so fast and immediately changes what we consider our innate abilities. But the
*  main thing we discuss is Alison's research on three ways that children learn that could
*  benefit AI. So just to prime you, here are those three ways. One, children learn via
*  imitation of others, not just blind physical imitation, but imitation of a person while
*  trying to make use of knowledge of that person's intentions and whether that person seems to
*  know what they're doing. And two, children learn by building abstract causal models.
*  So children build mental models of the world and can infer causal elements in that model,
*  like looking at a stack of blocks and knowing how to knock it over, for instance. And three,
*  kids have a high exploration versus exploitation ratio. So children try out all sorts of things
*  without specific goals just to explore, just because they're curious. And as we grow older
*  we explore less and exploit more what we know. You may remember Ken Stanley from episode 86,
*  who advocates an open-endedness approach to AI, where we step back from objectives and
*  objective functions and instead massively explore the space of possibilities. So kids' exploration
*  seems directly related to this idea, to me anyway. If you're a Patreon supporter, I just started a
*  Discord server for all of us. So I was asked by multiple people recently to start some sort of
*  community of Brain Inspired listeners. So this is a start of that, which will likely lead down the
*  road to some Zoom events. We'll see. But anyway, check your Patreon account and look for their
*  Brain Inspired posts for how to join that Discord community. Show notes are at braininspired.co
*  slash podcast slash 94, where I link to Alison's work, including a really nice little recent review
*  on the topic of children as high exploration machines. All right, enjoy the childlike yet
*  grandmotherly mind of Alison. Alison, I've been preparing this hundredth episode special,
*  and that means so I've asked a lot of the previous guests to send me replies to common,
*  some top listener questions. And the reason why I'm introducing the episode this way is because,
*  you know, I've reconnected with many of the people whom I've interviewed from the show,
*  and I've been struck by two things. One, there's a lot of talk these days about the need for more
*  diversity, more inclusivity, more equal opportunity, equal outcomes. And it sounds like everything
*  is just going to hell in a handbasket in the field in the neuroscience, cognitive sciences field.
*  But then I'm just consistently struck with how impressive and how generous and well intentioned
*  some of the people are in our field. I'm saying our field because it, you know, is a very broad
*  biological sciences field, let's say. And I'm wondering what your perspective is on the state
*  with regards to that sort of thing. You know, just the broad picture and how it, you know,
*  how it used to be and how you see it now. In terms of things like diversity and equity,
*  you mean? Yeah, and just the, there's a feeling like there's a state of emergency in the field,
*  like that we were doing it wrong, and we need to do it better. But then when my experience,
*  speaking to so many people is like, these are genuinely good people, well intentioned people.
*  And so the overall feeling is not so much one of doing it wrong. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it's
*  challenging about how do you manage to get, how do you manage to get as many people as you can
*  involved in the field. And I think it's a complicated, it's a complicated story. And of course,
*  in academia, we're not separate from, we're not separate from the world at large. So it's a,
*  it's an interesting question about what kinds of things can we do in a world that is unequitable
*  in various kinds of ways to improve the situation in our, in our own field. One thing that's been a
*  kind of interesting exercise for me has been the work that I've been doing recently in AI,
*  is a very good example of a field, you know, AI is an example of a field, for example, in which
*  there are very few women and women haven't been participating in the same way. And there's,
*  I think, some very self conscious efforts now to have more women involved. And there's been some
*  interesting consequences for that. So for instance, the work that I do about childhood and child
*  development, I think is a very good example of something that frankly has been sort of devalued
*  over the years, because it's something that's been associated with women. And you might say,
*  well, okay, look, if women are going to be spending their time thinking about children,
*  then that's going to affect their participation in the science. But of course, the interesting
*  thing is that people are realizing, oh, no, wait a minute, looking at children is actually
*  incredibly informative. And my suspicion is that they might not have heard about here's the things
*  that we know about childhood learning or about computation, if they hadn't been thinking, oh,
*  well, we should get some more women onto this panel. And somehow these women are doing things
*  about children. So I think that's a good example where, you know, even if the original impetus is,
*  let's get more diversity, let's have more women on the panel, the fact has been really more
*  diversity. I'm doing a diversity sort of a buzzword. But one of the things that comes out of my work,
*  and that comes out of neuroscience and ecology, is that diversity, technically speaking, having a
*  wider range of people and ideas is really a good thing for any kind of system. It's a particularly
*  good thing for any kind of learning system. And in fact, one of the things I've argued about children
*  is that the very randomness of children gives you more gives you more cognitive diversity. So
*  I think that's a really nice example where doing something where you're starting out at a meta
*  level saying, okay, we'll have diversity because we want diversity actually ends up having you can
*  sort of point to really advantages in terms of the diversity of the intellectual, intellectual work and
*  the intellectual ideas that comes about as a result of that. So I think there's, there's going to be
*  this kind of interaction that isn't going to happen immediately between wanting more diversity
*  in terms of people, but also wanting more diversity in terms of topics and ideas. So deciding,
*  for instance, that, you know, you want to hire someone who studies childhood development in an
*  AI group in a way that you might not have done before and then realizing, oh, wait a minute,
*  this is actually really informative and gives us a whole perspective we wouldn't have had before.
*  That Yeah, I hadn't made that connection between the exploration that we're going to talk about in
*  children and the diversity that would be beneficial just for idea generation. Exactly. That's right.
*  And there's some interesting, fascinating sociological work. I've just been
*  talking with a sociologist in Chicago named James Evans, who's actually done this beautiful work
*  where they use big data look at, you know, all of the papers that have appeared in science over the
*  last, you know, 50 years. And one of the things that they show is that you can show empirically
*  that the more diverse, the more diverse groups, the papers that have more diverse authors, it's
*  kind of interesting, they're more likely to have long term high citation rates. So if you just look
*  immediately, the the group that is everybody that, you know, is the usual suspects, and everybody
*  working together seems to get cited. But if you're looking at the long term, like what are the things
*  that really make the big revolutionary contributions that people see, you know, 20 years later,
*  those are more likely to be from groups that didn't know each other to begin with, or groups that
*  aren't in the same networks. And I, I think you can kind of see that in, I think that's a principle
*  that you can see at many, many levels from thinking about ecology to thinking about childhood,
*  to thinking about neuroscience, right. So one of the things that we that you know, is that what
*  happens an interesting thing that happens in development is you start out with this very
*  plastic flexible brain with many, many, many potential synaptic connections. And then what
*  happens as you get older is that the connections that get used a lot get maintained, and then the
*  ones that don't get pruned. So you literally are starting out with a brain that has more potential
*  for diversity. And then as you more potential for exploration, and then as you interact with the
*  environment, you end up with this brain that's much more finely tuned for one purpose.
*  Pete O'Loughlin Brittle, you might say.
*  Dr. Julie Kinn Yeah, exactly. So you've got this kind of
*  difference between brittle, but effective, right? Brittle, but efficient. So-
*  Pete O'Loughlin For certain things, sure.
*  Dr. Julie Kinn Yeah. So the idea is that, and in a sense,
*  right, it might seem kind of puzzling, like, why would you have to go through this process? Why not
*  just fine tune your brain to whatever it is that it needs to do to begin with? And I think it's the
*  same idea that having the diverse pathways early on gives you a chance to be robust in the face of
*  environmental change and variability. Pete O'Loughlin
*  Well, this is all like everything that you were just talking about is going to come up
*  over and again during the podcast. But I wanted to start out with a visual for you. Since this is an
*  audio podcast, I thought it'd be great to show you a visual and then you can describe it for the
*  audience, see if you can guess what it is here. But I'll preface this by saying, it's kind of a
*  running joke in my family since you were talking about having women be part of the AI community.
*  I am known as the motherly father in my family because my grandfather said that around the
*  dinner table one night and he meant it as a compliment. But of course, I have an older brother
*  and so now it's more of a running joke than recognized as a compliment. But I'm trying to
*  take it as a compliment. Okay, so here is, let's see, and I'm sorry, this is because the screen is
*  backwards. Can you describe what you see there? And that's 51 and 49.
*  51 and 49. So this is a circle with blue on one side and orange on the other and 51 and 49 on the
*  top. So this is a pie graph. And this is how I would explain to people the average of my
*  feelings about whether it's worth being a parent for about a six year stretch.
*  I would, it's about 51% worth it and 49% not. So it's barely worth it, right? Those are six kind of,
*  you know, six ish kind of hard years. But then recently, this is what my pie graph looks like
*  now, where it's more 67 33. So my kids are eight and six. And man, it's gotten a lot easier.
*  Yeah, I don't know if you remember. Yeah. Well, I'm a grandmother now of four babies,
*  the oldest of whom is nine. So I'm seeing a lot of the little ones too.
*  Right. You're going to make your grandson, Augie famous through your book, The Gardener and
*  the Carpenter. So, okay, so anyway, enough about my parenting experience. Let's talk about children.
*  So you have, you're in the midst of this project to develop common sense in AI. That's the big
*  DARPA grant, I believe, correct? That's right. Yeah. So there's been the deep learning explosion
*  and machine learning is all the rage, learning, learning, learning, it's all about learning.
*  But then there's been a little, not backlash, but some some checks on that. Because there have been
*  a few people like Liz Spelke, I've had her on the podcast, and she wouldn't denigrate learning. But
*  she does talk about the core knowledge skills. Now I can't remember the phrase, but things that
*  children are just about born with that they seem to come in to the world with an innate, some
*  core set of innate abilities, or they're developed very early on. And you also have people like Tony
*  Zader, who talks about how relatively unimportant learning is that the learning we do in our lifetime
*  is a very, very tiny amount relative to the optimization project process that's happened
*  through evolution. And I'm going to guess that you're heavy on the side of learning being much
*  more important than not important. Am I correct? Yeah, that's right. I mean, one of the things that's
*  been really interesting is going back to here's here's a way that I like to summarize it going
*  back not just to the 80s and not just back to the beginnings of AI, but going back to beginnings of
*  philosophy, really, to thinking about Plato and Aristotle, there's been this really foundational
*  kind of paradox. And here's the way I described the paradox. We seem to know a lot about the world
*  around us. And that knowledge seems to be very abstract and structured. And the fact that we have
*  this abstract structure knowledge about how space works, or how objects work, or how people work,
*  lets us make powerful new inferences and new predictions beyond what we immediately learn.
*  And of course, the most dramatic example of this is that eventually we have the very abstract kinds
*  of knowledge we have in science, but even in everyday life, that's part of the common sense,
*  we know a lot in our knowledge seems to have this really kind of abstract character. And yet that
*  information all seems to come from a bunch of disturbances of air at our ears and photons
*  hitting the back of our retinas. So the data we're getting from the world is this very, very
*  incoherent, specific particular impoverished. So how can we ever get there from here? How could we
*  ever end up with these kind of abstract theories about the world, given that the data seems to be
*  doesn't seem to have any of those characteristics. And going back to Plato and literally going back
*  to Plato and Aristotle, there's been sort of two ways of trying to answer that question. One of
*  them, which is the Plato way or Liz Specky's way or Noam Chomsky's way is to say, look, it only looks
*  as if we're learning this from the data, really the reason why we have all this abstract structure
*  is just there to begin with. And the data maybe is filling in some of the details, but the
*  we have this abstract structure to begin with. And the other and that's the approach of good
*  old fashioned AI back in the you know, back in the day, somebody like McCarthy or Lisp, that was a
*  kind of approach to AI that people had. It's the approach of philosophers like Descartes, the
*  approach of people like, like Chomsky and linguistics. And then the alternative has always been to say,
*  look, it only looks as if we have all this abstract structure. If we only look more closely,
*  we'll see that what we really have are a bunch of correlations among specific kinds of data. So we
*  can actually do all those things that we think that we need abstract structure for, we can do
*  all that just with correlations among the data. And, and that goes back again, that goes back to
*  Aristotle, it's the view that someone like Hume or JS Mail or the Association has have, then it's the
*  view of behaviorists, it's the view of connectionists in, in AI. And most recently, it's been the view
*  that's really been the underpinning of, of deep learning and machine learning. And, and there's
*  this kind of something of this kind of ping pong, but back and forth, where people try to use the,
*  the kind of it's all innate structure. And that runs up against problems. And then people go back
*  to no, it's just correlations. And that runs up against different problems. And I think for
*  developmental psychologists, now, of course, you know, someone like, like Liz Bucky is a developmental
*  psychologist. But as you say, I think she would even acknowledge this. Neither of those has seemed
*  like very good satisfactory results. Because when we actually look at what kids do, what we see is
*  that from the time that they're very, very young, even infants, they seem to have this kind of
*  abstract structured knowledge of the world around them. But and here's where I would disagree with,
*  with Liz. But they also seem to be modifying, changing, revising, altering that structure in
*  the light of the data that they see. So somehow that specific, very specific experience at your
*  eyes and ears, when you're saying nine months old, or three years old, seems to actually change the
*  kinds of abstract representations that you have. And, and Piaget, you know, is the great founder
*  of cognitive development, use the word constructivism to try to try to capture that fact. And unfortunately,
*  he couldn't say much more about like, what actually are the mechanisms that will enable you
*  to do that kind of constructive process. But that I think is the core of what we're trying to do,
*  at least for the Berkeley branch of this common sense project is to see, can we,
*  can we think of mechanisms that could have that kind of output? And I think, you know,
*  people in AI are increasingly realizing that if you know, winter is coming, right, there's been
*  this big AI spring. Yeah, there's been this wonderful AI spring, based on the fact that,
*  that things like the deep learning techniques, neural net techniques turn out to work really
*  well when you have enormous data sets, and when you have big, powerful computers. But I think
*  there's a sense that, you know, fall is in the air, we're coming up against some of the limitations
*  of those systems. So it takes, it's taken enormous amounts, every time you want to increase GPT-3. So
*  it's however many billion parameters more it's, it's using, it's an enormous investment. And it's
*  still is saying stupid things a lot of the time. So, so I think there's a sense that even though
*  there's been a lot of progress, the kind of learning that we see in, in something like deep
*  learning or deep reinforcement learning, just doesn't look like the kind of learning that we see
*  in babies and kids where we learn from very small sample, we make very big generalizations from very
*  small samples. And the question is, how is that? How can you do that? How is that possible?
*  So you, well, so Alan Turing, in his famous 1950 paper, said, quote, instead of trying to
*  produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the
*  child's. And you've been quoting Turing, this idea to, you know, create an AI child or to model,
*  you know, AI after a child. And you've noted that it's, it's only in the last few years that
*  this idea has sort of been acknowledged and accepted, and sort of taken off and more people
*  are using that quote from Turing's paper. I mean, for instance, when I started this podcast, like
*  two years ago, I had Dan Yeamans on, and he does a lot of like the deep learning matching to visual
*  cortical hierarchical systems in macaque brain. And that was his go to as well. That's, he quoted
*  Turing or at least mentioned him in mention that quote about needing to build a child and
*  thinking that that is the way to go. Yeah, it's it's funny. I mean, one of the things that this is a
*  true story. So I've been using that quote for a long time. And I always used it by saying preface
*  it by saying, you know, it's funny, here's this incredibly famous paper, it's the imitation game
*  paper, but people only read halfway. And when he says, well, let's wait a minute, maybe this whole
*  idea about the Turing test is wrong. Let's maybe we should have this other like the child Turing
*  test. People stop stop reading that. But then I was trying to actually find the quote for a talk
*  that I was giving about three years ago, when I was starting to do a lot more of this work. And
*  suddenly, this quote is all over the place. So everybody, everybody is using everybody's using
*  this quote. And I think obviously, the reason is that this, this big Renaissance in AI depended so
*  much on learning that then the obvious and of course, Turing's point is, you know, what you'd
*  really want is not a system where you built in the story, which is possibly apocryphal of the,
*  you know, the AI person saying, Okay, well, we're gonna figure out everything that everybody knows,
*  and we'll get a couple of interns over the summer, and then we'll program that into the computer,
*  right? That project, obviously, was not successful was coming up against a lot of boundaries. But
*  the learning learning turns out to really be the key to the recent successes. But then, of course,
*  if you're thinking about learning, you're starting to think about the best learners we know about for
*  children. And as I say, what we see is that children are doing a bunch of things that
*  the typical machine learning programs aren't doing. But that interestingly, there's a sort
*  of convergence. So for example, two of the things that well, here's three of the things that the
*  kids are doing that the typical, we're going to step through them in a moment as well, if, if,
*  if you're okay with that, and comment a little bit on each. But I want to ask you beforehand,
*  I mean, you've had a long and you know, you've been successful for a long time, quote unquote,
*  successful and productive. But it strikes me, you know, that you've had this thought this idea,
*  and you've been sort of preaching this for a long time before it has now become popular. How do you
*  know when you have an idea that's, you know, worth maintaining, despite not everyone in the outside
*  world getting it yet? Yeah, how patient do you have to be? I think that's a great question. And it's
*  one of the things that I talk about with my students all the time. I think it's probably
*  the hardest thing you have to do as a scientist, and actually doing the science, like getting the
*  idea and figuring out the experiments and doing them, the doing them is the hardest part, maybe.
*  But but I think one of the hardest things is, look, I have this really good idea. I'm not getting,
*  I'm not getting love from the rest of the world about it. When do I just give up? And when do I
*  keep going? And what's the answer? What's the answer? Well, for what it's worth. And now,
*  now that I'm an old person, I can say this, I tell my students, you know, I think of myself as
*  having had two really good, great big ideas in my career, one of which was very mind. Yeah,
*  well, theory theory in general, theory of mind in particular, and then the sort of causal inference
*  version of theory theory, the idea of using Bayesian models as a model for cognitive development.
*  And on all of those, it I couldn't get funded. There was a period when I first started doing it,
*  I couldn't get it published, I couldn't get it funded. The what I think of as the great
*  period in our lab, which was when actually Josh Tannenbaum was at Stanford then and Laura Schultz,
*  who's now at MIT was in my in my lab and tomorrow Kushner is now Cornell was and you know, it was
*  just a great, wonderful, exciting time, which was when we were starting to do the causal inference
*  work and started to collaborate with philosophers of science and computationalists on on Bayes nets
*  and causal graphs. None of my students had any funding because I that was the one time when I
*  didn't have any I had this drought for several years of not being able to get funded. So now,
*  of course, the trouble is, as in the case of art, you know, it doesn't the fact that you're not
*  getting funded doesn't prove that it's a good idea. But it is sort of striking to me that,
*  you know, that first phase of trying to think of the idea and then trying to figure out how to
*  implement it is really, is really difficult. And you have to stick through now I have to say there
*  have also been ideas that I had that just petered out because I couldn't figure out a way to turn
*  them into something that was ideas that I think are good ideas. And I couldn't figure out a way
*  to turn them into a productive research program. But you but you felt the same in your gut and
*  your intuition was the same about those ideas versus your other what you consider what has been
*  your successful ideas. Yeah, yeah. So it you know, you can't there are there are tragic examples of
*  people who've sort of isolated themselves from the community, just off pursuing their own,
*  their own ideas. And that isn't, you know, terribly successful. That can be that cannot,
*  you know, that even though our mythology is, oh, yeah, there's the brilliant genius who,
*  you know, locks him with him being their operative word, you know, up in the in an attic somewhere,
*  and then comes up with a great idea. That's not really the way it works in science, this gets back
*  to this diversity point, it works by having lots of people who are interacting with one another.
*  Is it the more the better the more people you can bounce your ideas off the better and not worry
*  about people stealing your ideas and scooping you and Yeah, that's that has been my that has been my
*  way of doing things over the years, partly because I'm, as my students will tell you,
*  I'm very bad at being tactful at all or saying anything other than whatever it is that I happen
*  to be thinking at the moment, which is sad, some other kinds of downsides. But I do think it's,
*  and again, I think that science suggests that the more open you are, the more diversity there is,
*  the better and you know, the open science movement, the transparency movement has been a really good
*  example of how, how much more productive, how much more productive that is. But one thing that I
*  think is interesting is that people don't maybe appreciate as much and I don't have any,
*  I think this is an art form, I don't have any recipe is turning the good idea into an
*  operational experiment. So you know, my background is in philosophy, in many ways, I still think of
*  myself as being more a philosopher than a psychologist. And you can have a wonderful idea.
*  But if you can't turn it into something that you can turn into an actual empirical research program,
*  yeah, it's not productive. And, and sometimes what happens is you have ideas about how you're
*  going to turn it into a real experiment, it just doesn't work. And at some point, you have to say,
*  okay, just need to do something else. With developmental psychology, that's especially
*  true, because it's very hard to anticipate what things are going to work with kids and whatnot.
*  I mean, after you know, 30 years, you start to have some intuitions about it. But there's lots
*  of times where I would say, that's just gonna be too hard, kids aren't gonna be able to do it,
*  they're not gonna be able to concentrate, etc. And it turns out that they do beautifully. And then
*  other times where I think, okay, this will really get the kids engaged. And the kids just look at
*  you like, what are you doing? I don't want to do this. This is boring and stupid. And I don't get
*  what the point is. So you're you're always in this position of, you know, trying to translate that,
*  not just for us, not just translating it into an experiment, but translating it into an experiment
*  that, you know, three year olds are going to be willing to engage. Right. Right. Okay, well,
*  let's talk three year olds, three and four year olds, I suppose, is around the age group
*  that inspires this these algorithms and these ways of learning. So, so you talk about three main ways
*  that children can teach us about learning and perhaps building AI that learns better than the
*  current AI. So I'm going to let's just talk about imitation first kind of quickly. And then we'll
*  and then we'll go into abstract causal models. And then we'll finish with a longer exploration
*  of exploration. So so imitation is the first one. Do you want to just say a few words about
*  what about children's behavior and way of moving through the world with regards to imitation could
*  be used? Why would that be useful for AI? Well, one of the things that is really striking about
*  humans is that we learn from other people. And in fact, you know, you could argue that we learn
*  more from other people than we do from any other source, right? I mean, most of what we learn
*  is something that is being conveyed to us through one way or another by other people,
*  although we learn a lot from our own experience as well. And, and our capacity for culture,
*  our capacity to have each generation pass on information to the next generation is one of the
*  really distinctive, our distinctive evolutionary advantages. And it turns out that even I mean,
*  in this case, newborn babies already seem to be tuned to learn from other people through imitating
*  what they do. But what we and others have discovered is that it isn't like they just sort of mindlessly
*  imitate, they imitate in very subtle ways. So they'll imitate someone differently, depending
*  on whether they think that the person was doing something on purpose or accidentally, or whether
*  the person was doing something in order to teach them or was just doing something in order to
*  accomplish a particular a particular goal. And they vary systematically, we have some really
*  lovely experiments that show this, combine the information they get from other people with their
*  own experience. And they'll do that to do things like judge how reliable and other person's
*  evidences. And again, beautiful work showing that even three and four year olds will judge whether
*  someone's testimony is, you know, is this someone who you can rely on? Even is this someone who can
*  rely on in a particular domain? You know, so is this this is someone who knows a lot about, you
*  know, wood, so I'm going to listen to what he says about wood, but not necessarily. Or here's a better
*  example. Here's someone who knows a lot about physics. So I'm going to listen to what he says
*  about physics, not necessarily about consciousness, right? Wait a second, your physicists would
*  disagree with you. You know, just because you know a lot about physics doesn't mean you know a lot
*  about about everything else. Interesting example. But three year olds can figure this out. So,
*  that's one being able to imitate, but not just imitate and being able to learn culturally in
*  general, in these sophisticated ways is obviously a big capacity that humans have. And if you look at
*  robotics, for example, is an is an example of a field where they're trying very hard to try and
*  get robots to learn by demonstration. Because of course, things like motor skills are almost
*  impossible to sort of explicitly describe to someone or explicitly program in. And it's
*  interesting that it's actually hard, you know, it's hard to get you think even even just getting a
*  robot that can imitate your physical gesture turns out to be turns out to be quite demanding. So I
*  think that's a very promising line of research. But so it really is about understanding the
*  intentions of others and being able to imitate based on not just what not just their actions,
*  but the intentions of their actions. Exactly. That's right. Yeah. So the, the second way of
*  the three that the three main ways are using abstract causal models. Maybe you can say a bit
*  about that. Yeah. So again, if you're thinking about this difference between the sort of
*  innate is approach to thinking about knowledge and learning. One of the questions is what kinds
*  of models can you have about the world and in particular, what kinds of models can you learn
*  from your experience of the world. And this is really the start of the work that I've been doing
*  in AI and computation now for 20 years, starting around 2000, in fact, a little before then,
*  this came out of this idea of the theory theory. So the idea was that children are doing things
*  that are very much like intuitive theory. So then, of course, we went to the philosophers of science
*  and people in computer science and said, Okay, so tell us what is it that scientists are doing when
*  they have theories. And they said, Oh, we don't know, you know, just maybe psychologists know.
*  But around the odds, there was this really interesting convergence of work from people
*  in philosophy of science and people in computer science, looking at, in particular, at understanding
*  the causal structure of the world. That's something that theories really do. They do other things. But
*  one of the most important things they do is they tell you about what causes what out in the world.
*  And there was this very exciting bunch of work showing how you could actually construct causal
*  models from data. So this was an example where a kind of representation that was really important
*  and really abstract and complex, we could think of some systematic ways that you could actually
*  build a causal model from looking at correlations between events. And this is very general, very,
*  very general, powerful ways of understanding the world. So the question was, are kids doing
*  something like that? And what we did was actually give kids, this is the part where about, you know,
*  figuring out the experimental technique, what we did is figure out a way to actually give kids
*  information about a causal system, our blicket detectors, little machine that lights up. Yeah,
*  our blicket. And then just say to them, Can you make this work? Or can you tell me which one's
*  a blicket? And when we did that, it turned out the kids were incredibly sensitive to
*  pretty complicated statistical patterns. When we were doing this in parallel, people like
*  Jenny Safran and Dick Aslan at Rochester were showing that even infants are sensitive to these
*  statistical patterns. But not only were they sensitive to the statistical patterns, but they
*  were quite automatically and spontaneously using them to make causal inference the way that a
*  scientist or a statistician would do. And what we've done since then over the past 20 years is
*  show just how general and powerful that kind of learning is. You can not only learn specific causal
*  relations, but you can learn abstract higher level causal relations. You can learn multiple causal
*  relations with multiple variables. You can use that kind of learning to do experiments. You can
*  learn both from observation and experiment the way scientists do. So that's been you can postulate
*  unobserved causal variables. So you know, you see a pattern that doesn't make sense unless you think
*  there's some hidden thing that's behind the curtain that's responsible for it. And again,
*  even little kids are doing that. You can use analogy to try to say, okay, the causal structure
*  in this domain is like the causal structure in this other domain, another really important
*  kind of learning. So it's been very exciting because it's a kind of example of where how you
*  could do this constructivist project in real life of taking a bunch of data and then building
*  abstract models. And then in the past, maybe 10 years, people across cognitive science have
*  really generalised this idea more to talk about probabilistic generative models in general. So
*  even if you go beyond causality, the idea is that you can build these genitive models. And when you
*  build the generative models, you have a generative model, it lets you make predictions that important.
*  But it also means that then you can go backwards and use Bayesian methods to go from the data and
*  decide what the right generative model is. And one of the things that I think is happening a lot in AI
*  now, in a very exciting way is having these kind of hybrid models that have generative models of
*  one sort or another, especially causal models, and yet use some of the powerful learning techniques
*  from things like deep learning to actually learn those models from data. So you have these kind of
*  hybrid combination of trying to make sense out of the data and then trying to build the models based
*  on the data. One of the things that you've said is that the reason why kids are better at learning
*  these causal abstract models is because they have fewer priors. So they start off with a cleaner
*  slate. And this will come up again, I think, when we talk about exploration in a second. But
*  so is there a paradox in that? So children and let's say a low prior causal abstract model
*  has to build priors over time. And then that's what learning is, right? So it seems like it's
*  a goal almost, or a direction for development and learning. But is there a paradox that,
*  can we build systems that forever learn in that way? Or does learning by definition include
*  building the priors that then make us worse learners, adults or trained up AI systems?
*  Dr. Liza Farrar Yeah, I mean, I think one of the things that I increasingly think that we don't
*  appreciate enough in cognitive science is the idea, and maybe we don't appreciate enough in,
*  I suspect in the United States in general, is the idea that there are genuine trade offs that you
*  can't always optimize everything. And this is something that, of course, comes out of the
*  technical work in computer science in pretty vivid ways, right? So you can't optimize both having
*  as much information as you can and having a stronger prior as you can and being as open
*  to learning as you can. Those two things are just intrinsically in tension with one another.
*  And I think that I want to emphasize a lot is a lot of the traditional ways of thinking about
*  development have been, okay, this kind of implicit teleology that there's some place you want to get
*  like, you know, whoever the whoever the 30 year old boy genius is in your department, like that's the
*  absolute peak of all of human cognition, right? And development is about can you get to be
*  more and more and more like that, like that mind, right? That's really what you're trying to do.
*  Dr. Michael O'Brien You're not helping tear down stereotypes here.
*  Dr. Liza Farrar Yeah, and then and then of course, as you get older, you're just falling off from
*  that. You're just falling off from that model. But that doesn't make much sense from an evolutionary
*  point of view. Like if it was so great to be that guy, then why not just be that guy, right?
*  And the ideas that there really are these genuine trade offs and having a period of childhood,
*  for example, it's not that the children are just sort of defective grownups who have to develop
*  priors. But but that they're very, the very fact that you start out with a system that doesn't
*  that has a flatter prior is actually an advantage. Now, if you just and this is the point about the
*  explorers point trade off in general that we'll talk about in a minute, of course, if you just
*  were always ignorant, right? It might make you good at learning, but you're gonna always be
*  ignorant. So I mean, the whole point of learning is to be able to have enough structure so that
*  you can quickly make decisions, for example, in a in a new situation. But it always has this trade
*  off that as you get, as you learn more, you're going to be seeing less, you're going to be less
*  open to information from the world around you. And I think that that's really is, when you said
*  it's a paradox, it is but I mean, that's what it is. That's the point. The point is that it's
*  there's this intrinsic trade off between these two, between these two developments.
*  But but if you're using the idea that children use, you know, these have these low prior causal
*  abstract models, and that's what we should model AI after, then the AI is going to become adult
*  too, right? So, you know, I'm trying to picture how the AI will continue to be great AI in that
*  low prior structure, like in this situation that you just described, where we're at the trade off
*  over time, and you end up with specialized AIs either way. Yeah, I mean, I think exactly the
*  question is, and the advantage of relying on learning is, is this point about flexibility,
*  right? So I've argued that what we need to have an AI is we need to have a kind of developmental
*  story within AI. So we might need to actually have some differentiation, a kind of division of labor
*  between here's say parts of our system that are that are the explorers, and then here's parts of
*  our system that are actually the actors or an obvious thing, start out with a system that is,
*  that doesn't know as much that isn't as competent, and then let it develop into a system that is
*  competent, which again, is kind of what something like deep learning, that's the advantage of
*  something like, of something like deep learning. The problem is, anytime you build something in,
*  it's going to have the advantage that you're going to have things built in, you're going to
*  be more competent if that's true in that in the world in which the thing that you build in is true.
*  But of course, you don't know that you're going to be in the world in which the thing that you
*  built in is true. So you're going to have a disadvantage if the world turns out not to be
*  the world that in which the thing that you that you built in is true. And I think what biologists
*  call life history, the developmental trajectory of an organism is actually a way of trying to
*  deal with those kinds of tensions and trade off. What do you think about that phrase life history?
*  I love it. So this is a wonderful life history is a wonderful example of exactly of this kind
*  of interdisciplinary interaction. So if you if you ask most psychologists, including most
*  developmental psychologists, they wouldn't even know what life history means. I was going to say
*  like that I have a hard time with the phrase just because it doesn't sound like it means what it
*  means to me. Yeah. Well, you know, it's what always happens when you have technical when you
*  have a technical a technical term. If you ask evolutionary biologists, they immediately know
*  what you're talking about, because life histories are really, really important part of biology. I
*  think one of the ideas, you know, in biology, they're less interested in trying to differentiate
*  between sort of the psychological and biological, for example. So life histories include a whole
*  lot of just physical biological things about, you know, physically, how long does it take you to
*  mature? How senescent are you? When do you die? In fact, in biology, a lot of the life history is
*  about things like that. When do you reproduce? When do you when does an organism die and so forth? So
*  so it sort of starts out in this physical context. But I think it's actually really informative in
*  the psychological context, too, to think about, think about the whole way our whole life unfolds,
*  and think about the way that a life unfolds for a species as, as a really informative piece about
*  how that species is managing to adapt to its environment. So I've been, I've been on a campaign
*  to get life history into psychology. We just have a paper, a special issue of Proceedings of the
*  Royal Society that came out called Life History and Learning, which I think is the first time that
*  people have tried to put together those two ideas. Well, so let's go ahead and segue into
*  exploration versus exploitation, because that's within that series of papers, this is what you
*  really focus on. But so that's the third thing that the third main way that children learn that
*  you could you see as being inspirational for potentially building into AI, and that is active
*  learning, which includes play and exploration. And you've said that childhood is evolution's
*  solution to the explore exploit dilemma. Right? Have you heard of the concept from computer
*  science? This is from Ken Stanley, actually, who's on my podcast a while back of open endedness.
*  I mean, I'm not sure what the specific idea is supposed to be. But
*  okay, so I'm going to read a quote here. Well, okay, so the idea of open endedness,
*  and I emailed him after to and I sent him your work. The idea of open endedness is essentially
*  that by trying to follow objectives by using objective functions by trying to achieve objectives
*  in work places, and to generate great ideas, what we actually need to do is remove the objective,
*  right? Objective to do great things, remove objectives. And so it's very in line. So here's
*  a quote from your book, The Gardener of the Carpenter. The fundamental paradox of the explore
*  exploit trade off is that in order to be able to reach a variety of goals in the long run,
*  you have to actively turn away from goal seeking in the short run. These these two ideas seem to
*  jive pretty well together. And yeah, I think so. And it's you know, this of all the things that
*  of all the things that are, you know, lessons for AI from childhood, you know, before
*  people in AI were thinking, I think about children, they were starting to think about
*  active learning and exploration and recognizing that to get a system that can be robust,
*  you need to be able to have it actually get, you know, kind of escape from its mainframe and get
*  out there and actually be deciding what kind of information it wants to get from the world itself.
*  And in order to do that, you need to have objective functions that include things like curiosity,
*  right? So satisfying curiosity, I mean, curiosity is fascinating. I have a grant and I've been
*  thinking a lot about it. Curiosity is fascinating because it has all the structure of a motivational
*  system. It comes with emotions, you know, like you're curious, you're just driven, you know,
*  you go out and you feel like you're just not going to be happy until you solve that problem.
*  And yet it doesn't come with any obvious utilities, right? So you know, you get a bunch of
*  information, but it's not at all obvious that the information is going to do anything for you.
*  So the idea that I think people in neuroscience have had as well, and I think it's a very
*  interesting idea is sort of, you could take the take the structure of classic structure reward of
*  something like, okay, you get what your goal and you get a burst of dopamine, and then you go out
*  and try and get more of the dopamine or whatever, and apply it in to something like curiosity. So
*  you could think that part of what especially happens with humans is we get this kind of extra
*  sort of pseudo motivational system that uses a lot of the same apparatus, we're motivated,
*  we're happy when we do it, we want to do it, we're trying to accomplish it, even though the goal
*  isn't any of the goals that you would think of as being a typical, a typical goal for an organism,
*  right? It's not increasing its resources, it's not increasing its reproductive success,
*  it's not doing any of those kinds of any of those kinds of immediate things. And I think that's one
*  way of thinking about curiosity. We've been doing a bunch of work recently about play. And
*  an interesting idea about play is that it's a situation in which you set yourself these goals,
*  but they're not the goals that are actually useful for anything, but they teach you what it means to
*  set up and accomplish goals. And they might be sub goals in some new problem that you're going
*  to have to face that you're going to have to face in the future. So that you could there's some very
*  interesting work in in meta reinforcement learning, where the idea is that you're learning to learn. So
*  learning how to accomplish something like I don't know, like playing chess or, or, or even more,
*  my my grandson plays what we call addy chess. So he this is he's five now, but when he was four,
*  he watches big brother who plays chess chess, and then he'd play addy chess, which is things like,
*  I'm going to knock over all the pieces, or I'm going to put all the pieces in the waste basket,
*  or, and now I'm gonna, you know, see if I can put all the white pieces on the black squares,
*  and setting up these kind of sub goals that are not actually the goal of chess. But you can see why
*  figuring out how to do all those things are the kind of sub goals that you might need if you're
*  actually going to get to the point of doing something like playing chess, or at least just
*  playing playing with the world in general. Which also that that particular example, he has some of
*  the other features that are part of these exploration qualities, like that's noisy and random.
*  And I don't know if you'd call it risky, maybe if you're gonna lose a piece, kind of impulsive,
*  and definitely involves play and, and just curiosity, like an intrinsic motivation
*  for actively learning, I suppose. Yeah, and one of the one of the other big points that I want,
*  that I've been making is that, and this is part of the trade off point is that things that are
*  bugs from the perspective of exploration, can be features from the perspective of exploitation,
*  and vice versa, or maybe a better way of putting it is that things that are bugs from the perspective
*  of exploitation can be features from the perspective of exploration. So being impulsive, taking risks,
*  doing things in a kind of random way, having a lot of variability in what you do doing things
*  without necessarily getting any high utilities out of them. Those are all things that look make
*  you look irrational if you're thinking about it from the exploit perspective. And in fact,
*  those are the things that traditionally have led people to say that children are irrational, or,
*  you know, kind of not not very functional or not very adapted. But those are all things that are
*  exactly what you want. If you want to get high levels of you want to get high levels of
*  exploration. And the biological literature is really interesting about the fact that being in
*  this protected period of childhood gives you a context in which you can, you can exploit these,
*  as it were, you can exploit these bugs, you can you can be an explorer, because nothing is riding
*  on it, you don't have to worry about one. One way I put it is that babies and young children have
*  exactly one utility function, which they're extremely good at maximizing, which is be as
*  cute as you possibly can be. And as long as you're as cute as you possibly can be, then and you
*  probably know this if you've had little, you know, when you were you were showing your your pie chart,
*  right? Well, why do you keep going? Well, it's because every, you know, somehow in the middle
*  of all this, there's this adorable smile. And, you know, just amazing, overwhelming cuteness. And that
*  just keeps you going in terms of taking care of this, taking care of this little creature. But
*  aside from that, you the babies are free to just be learners and thinkers.
*  No, I mean, yes, the cuteness works for sure. One of the things though, that's interesting to me from
*  a, you know, because I continue to just come back to think of how these, how these qualities could
*  apply in AI. And one of the consequences of children having that long period where nothing
*  is riding on it is that it's a high cost to the environment, including their caretakers, be those
*  parents or grandparents or ala parents. And it struck me that maybe there's like, a pretty high
*  cost if you're going to build the AI. So now thinking like, well, if you build this into AI,
*  what does that mean in terms of are they, are they going to be relying on the adult AIs,
*  you know, driving them crazy in the process? Or how that how will that look?
*  Well, I think that's exactly the point is that one of the things that I've been thinking about
*  recently, this is a bit of a segue. So one thing is just, you know, just, just the kind of research
*  and development, being able to have the system not be very successful to begin with, but then
*  have more success across, again, I think the important dimensions are robustness and
*  variability. So either the trade off is it's easy to design a system that does one thing really,
*  really well. But the problem is what happens when you want it to do something else. And
*  part of robotics is a nice example, I think, where in some of these collaborations, this has been very
*  vivid, right? So if I said, Yeah, okay, great, I'm going to get a robot, it doesn't matter. It'll
*  do one thing well, like it'll pick up a nail. Well, it turns out, no, no, that's not one thing
*  for a robot, right? What the robot might be, you could train to be very good at is moving its head
*  in exactly this particular trajectory to get this particular object that this particular size and,
*  and pick it up. And even just being able to get it so damn it, you know, you could move its arm
*  over a little bit, and it could still get to the nail turns out to be really challenging, let alone
*  put it in an environment where, you know, it's not picking up nails, it's picking up pens, and
*  it's in a different factory and getting it to be able to do that. So so this robustness and
*  variability is really, really important. And an idea that again, you see in robotics is,
*  start out with a system that's not actually doing as good a job, but, but if you let it learn, then
*  it will be able to be more robust. And especially if you let it learn in this kind of playful,
*  exploratory, in this kind of playful, exploratory way, one project that we're doing working on now,
*  which is, I think is just a lovely project is we're collaborating with some people at
*  at Google Brain and Pierce Cerméne at Google Brain has this beautiful and Corey Lynch,
*  a beautiful result where they're looking at this goes back to imitation. So they're designing
*  robots that are supposed to be imitating people to do things like, you know, have a desktop and
*  put things in, in drawers on the desk. And what they discovered was the first way you might think
*  that you would train the robot is you show it people putting things into doors and desks. And
*  that's the data that it's going to use to figure out what it should do itself. Well, it turns out
*  that when you do that, you get this classic kind of overfitting where the robot gets to be very
*  good at doing exactly what the person did, but can't generalize to anything new. So instead,
*  what they did was they gave the robot, they said, just to Google engineers, just play with the things
*  on the desk, don't try and do anything, just play with them. And what they discovered was that if
*  you gave that data to the robot, the robot was much more robust. So having this, you're not trying to
*  do anything, you're just messing around, you're just playing. It lets you explore the space in
*  a way that meant that you ended up with a more robust system later on. There's also a beautiful
*  neuroscience funding that I really like like this, where this is Beckett EBITS. And they were looking
*  at, you know, really doing single cell recording in primates who were solving these classic
*  reinforcement learning bandit tests. So the way reinforcement learning bandit test goes is,
*  you know, you have two, basically, you have two buttons to press, you have two levers to pull,
*  and one of them gives you a certain amount of reward, and the other one gives you a reward
*  more often. And the problem is, what you wrap very rapidly can learn how to do is pull the one that
*  is going to give you the most reward. But the problem is, if the environment changes, maybe
*  it's going to turn out that actually the other one is going to be more rewarding. So if you think
*  about like a natural foraging context, you know, you eat all the fruit off of one tree, and the
*  other tree is actually going to be a better a better bet now than it was before. So this is like
*  the classic Explorer exploit framework, where when do you decide that you're going to try the thing
*  that wasn't as successful before. So what they did was they actually did recording in the sort
*  of decision making parts of the brain when the as the monkeys were trying to make this decision.
*  And one idea was, well, maybe it's that you have to kind of make this meta decision where you say,
*  okay, I've been doing this for long enough, maybe there's been a change, maybe I should try the
*  other piece, in which case you'd expect to see activation of decision making. But what they
*  actually saw was that other parts of the brain just injected noise into the decision making process.
*  So it was like if you're trying to imagine the phenomenology animal was like, how would this I've
*  just been pushing this goddamn lever all day. It's really boring. Let me just I just want to
*  do something else like forget about this. Yeah. And that was and I think that, you know, just the hell
*  with this, I don't know what the long term effect of this is going to be, I'm just going to explore
*  is more like what you see when you see the kids who are really exploring just for their own sake.
*  So every once in a while, the brain just kicks itself. Yeah, exactly. So I have a few listener
*  questions here, if you're game for it. Sure. This from Sammy is, is exploration versus exploitation
*  a valid dichotomy, given that everything is an uncertain prediction at a certain level. And he's
*  wondering if there's evidence in brains for that, or brain structures, or if there's evidence for a
*  kind of spectrum between explore exploit, like what how dichotomous are they? Well, you know,
*  there's an interesting question that again, again, gets back to this randomness question. If you look
*  at adults, you see two quite different kinds of exploration, which people describe as being either
*  directed or random. So this gets back to exactly the point that I was just making. So you know,
*  you could say, all right, well, if I'm a scientist doing an experiment, for example, I have to
*  actually sit down and think, which experiment should I do that will give me the most information
*  that will be relevant to the goal that I'm attempting to accomplish later on. And sometimes
*  when you're exploring, it's that kind of exploration where you're self conscious about I need information
*  in order to be able to accomplish a particular outcome. So you could think of that as being kind
*  of almost like a sub goal when you're exploiting is okay, I need information so I can exploit more
*  effectively. But sometimes you're doing this more random exploration, like those monkeys, where you're
*  just saying, and as a scientist, too, you know, scientists, officially aren't supposed to just do
*  fishing expeditions, but I bet you'll never find a good scientist who doesn't say, yeah, boy, this
*  great idea just came because I was messing around in this totally unexpected thing happened. And in
*  fact, there's actually some nice sociology studies that show that the difference in the Nobel Prize
*  winning labs is when something weird happens, do you say, Oh, forget about it, that's just a
*  distraction. And you say, Huh, that's weird. Why did that happen? Let's figure out why that happened.
*  So I do think there's a there's a, you know, there's some sense in which you could say in the
*  and of course, in the from the evolutionary perspective, in the long, long run, you're
*  talking about, you know, thriving in environments and having reproductive success, which is an
*  exploit value. But in the short run, I think you can you can really discriminate between,
*  between the systems that are responsible for this. And you even see brain discrimination in the brain
*  between the systems that are responsible for one process and the other.
*  Is synaptic pruning in infants modeled as a gradually lower learning rate? Does that does
*  that analogy hold when modeling differences between brain region regions in adults?
*  Yeah, that's a really good question. And one of the issues is, you know, what's the relationship
*  between this gets back to the point that you were making before about, you know, you don't want to
*  be as good a learner in a sense when you're an adult, exactly because you can rely on the
*  things that you've already learned. So I do think one of the things that I think is interesting is
*  if you take an introductory cognitive psychology or cognitive science class, right, and you take
*  the class that's the adult cognitive psychology class, or look at that textbook, and then you
*  take the cognitive development class, they talk about totally different things. So the adult
*  cognitive psychology class is going to be about attention and memory, and decision making and
*  putting things in short term stores versus long term stores and trying to decide what values you
*  should have and how you calculate your utilities under uncertainty. Those are all the topics you're
*  going to see in any kind of standard cognitive psychology textbook. If you go and you read the
*  developmental the cognitive development textbook, you're going to hear about intuitive theory
*  formation and grammar induction and statistical learning. Now each of them, you know, the it's
*  like at the end of the grown up textbook, there might be like a chapter about learning and in the
*  end of somewhere in the kids textbook, there might be something about attention and memory,
*  but it really is striking that it's like they're really, really, really different systems. And
*  the adult one really is one where learning is not always going to be an advantage. That's not the
*  main point. Whereas for the kids, I think the point that is the main point.
*  Very good. Donald wonders, and this is a little bit different changing topics just a little bit,
*  if it's if this is relevant for when researchers tend to publish their breakthrough research. So
*  first of all, you know, if it's true that breakthrough legacy establishing research,
*  you know, publications come earlier in careers, and two if so, if graduate students have a high
*  exploration ratio relative to later in the career. Well, I think once you're talking about adulthood,
*  one of the interesting things is that we were more context determined, I think, than in childhood. So
*  I think, you know, in child, the truth is in childhood, like you're not going to be able to
*  get your three year old to be efficient at getting themselves together and getting to preschool,
*  no matter what you do, right? So you might as well just, you might as well just enjoy the single
*  tier. You might as well just enjoy the exploration, because it's just the the other thing,
*  this isn't going to happen. But of course, when you're talking about adults, even sort of post
*  adolescence, adolescence is a really interesting period from this perspective. But if you're talking
*  about, you know, people over the age of 20, let's say, we have the capacity to do both of those
*  things. And we can move back and forth depending on the context we find ourselves in. And again,
*  you know, if you're in a more protected context, like, hopefully graduate school,
*  then that gives you an opportunity for exploration. So I think it's an interesting
*  question within adulthood about how much it is really just this, you know, as you get older,
*  you get less exploratory and how much it is that the context you find yourself in may make you less
*  exploratory. And one of the things that I was saying before about my own career, and I think
*  the career of lots of productive scientists is that you'll sort of go through say, 10 years for
*  me, it's been sort of 10 years of really nailing down an idea, and then getting kind of bored and
*  wanting to be a kid again, and taking something that's like, you know, causal base nets are like,
*  reinforcement learning, you don't know anything about or life history, something you don't know
*  anything about to begin with. And putting yourself in that kind of challenging situation is actually
*  the thing that gives you the inspiration in which you become an expert and you learn and you do a
*  bunch of you do a bunch of things afterwards. So I think a lot of it in adults depends on context.
*  And you can see something like, you know, that's the rationale behind having a sabbatical every
*  seven years or spending time at the Center for Advanced Studies is that you can you pull someone
*  out of the conventions that they have, and then that enables them to think about something in a
*  new way, kind of get back to this Zen masters called beginner's mind, even when you're even when
*  you're an adult, even when you're older. And I think some of this in an interesting one of the
*  things that I'm very interested in now, just starting to be really interested in is the if
*  you're thinking about that human life history, there's the childhood part, which is distinctive,
*  but then there's also the what I think of as the elder part, sort of 50 to 70, which is also
*  distinctive. So chimps are dead by the time they're 50. And humans are very unusual in that we have
*  this post menopausal period. And then, you know, men kind of get it for free as well, this later
*  period of 50 to 70. And one interesting idea is that there might be sort of further adaptations to
*  being in that niche. It's no longer the niche of either in a way exploring or exploiting, I think
*  that's the niche of caring and teaching. And one of the things that you start to see is that kids
*  are learning some of the big structure of the environment, not so much from the parents as from
*  the grandparents, the grandparents are the ones who are telling the stories, making up the myths,
*  sort of seeing, seeing and being willing to convey here's what the big here's what the big picture,
*  I, I must admit, I have found myself, of course, in the AI community, conveying that perhaps there
*  was a result in like, you know, 2015 is an important role of elders. Can't believe that
*  there actually was something back in the ancient olden days, like 2015. But I think that that that's
*  part of the idea. Yeah, I was gonna ask you about just elderly, I mean, there's so much focus on how
*  great children are learning and what you know, through your work, what we can learn about making
*  better AI through studying children. And I, you know, what is there in the those the poor elderly
*  population, they always get the short end of the stick, they don't get to be the 30 year old white
*  guy in his attic, right? And they don't get to be the infinitely potential child. So what what good
*  are they? Yeah, no, that's the interesting I just, I just wrote a piece in, in aion, which is a great
*  kind of ideas journal, which I love. So I have a piece that just came out exactly about this. And
*  in fact, my new book was originally going to be called explore, and it was going to be about
*  children, and it still will be but I'm now thinking that I'm going to call it curious children, wise
*  elders. And the idea would be that there's really this kind of three stages of man, or three stages
*  of human woman. In fact, woman is sort of more in some ways more appropriate, where you have this
*  explore period, then you have this exploit period. But then you have the only way that the explore
*  period will work is if you have care, right? If you have a con if you're in a context in which
*  you're being taken care of. But more than that, if you're a cultural species, and interestingly,
*  the only other species we know of that has postmenopausal grandmothers are is the orcas.
*  And it turns out the orcas are a rare example of a cultural species, a species that has cultural
*  transmission. You think about cultural transmission, the niche of being the person who's passing on the
*  information to the next culture comes in very naturally fits very naturally with the person
*  who's also providing the safe environment in which you can explore. And I think those elders
*  are really that that's really what their niche is their niche is we've accumulated the information
*  over our lifetime, and we're kind of going to be in charge of the information that's been accumulated
*  over previous lifetimes. And now our job is take care of the people who need to be taken care of
*  and also transmit the information to the new to the new generation. There's a beautiful paper
*  by Michael Gerben that is in this filter that I really like where they looked at hunters.
*  And one of the things that is kind of an interesting contradiction is if you're thinking
*  about culture, you assume yeah, the young hunters are not very good at hunting, and they have to
*  learn it by observing and learning from the older hunters, that's a great human advantage.
*  But of course, as anyone who has kids knows, like, when we make pancakes with grandchildren,
*  it takes four times as long as when we make pancakes without the grandchildren, because
*  it's hard to actually get something done when you're trying to teach someone who's not very
*  competent to do it at the same time. And that's before the cleanup. Yeah. And what Michael
*  discovered was that the pair what you saw is the again, you know, like the 30 year old guys were
*  going off by themselves and hunting, that was the most efficient way for them to bring back
*  hunting. It was not really a great idea to have a bunch of eight and nine year olds trailing along
*  behind you if you just want to get the biggest, the biggest hunting yield. But if you had the
*  eight and nine year olds with the older people weren't as efficient, they weren't as strong,
*  they weren't as good at hunting anymore. But they had the knowledge, right? They were the ones who
*  really had the information. And they were the ones who also had the time and resources to give it to
*  the children. So you sort of saw these, these pairs of the younger people and the older people
*  and then the middle aged people were off doing the things that they had to do to get the resources,
*  or to we're teaching the kids how to do the practical things you need to do to get the
*  resources. At least the grandmothers. So what you're saying is that basically the old men are the
*  only worthless beings. No, the old men were actually the ones who were the hunting were hunting as well,
*  if they can just keep themselves focused. Yeah. I mean, the grandmothers are more dramatic,
*  because of course, it's from it from an evolutionary perspective. But I think the idea is that the old
*  and you know, this might my possibly self serving evolutionary just so story is, you know,
*  if this is true, if this is the niche, then remembering what happened yesterday, right,
*  like everybody knows what happened yesterday, but remembering what happened 50 years ago,
*  or in the case of AI, remembering what happened in 2000. That's actually a really useful thing
*  to remember. So you can even imagine some cognitive adaptation so that not being as good at immediate
*  not being as good at immediate, immediately remembering something as opposed to being able
*  to remember the thing that happened a long time before the person you talked to was around a good
*  adaptation. Speaking of remembering, and I know we're running short on time here. So I have like
*  so many questions that I'm not gonna be able to ask you. But one I want to make sure I ask you about
*  is about consciousness. And so our intelligence, and our learning, like we've been discussing
*  changes over time, our entire being changes over time. And you know, Thomas Nagel has the famous
*  What is it like to be a bat? way of thinking about how we can't know others subjective experience.
*  But you could say the same thing about being a child, what you know, what is it like to be a
*  child, even though we were all children, we're so different as adults, I can't remember what it used
*  to be like to be a child, I can only pretend I don't trust my memories of what I felt like it was
*  like when I was a child. And I can kind of see it through my children, but I'm just too far removed.
*  It's a different lifetime, it's a different existence. And I'm wondering how so along with
*  that is, you know, comes your subjective experience. And I'm wondering how you you consciousness
*  throughout development is because I know that you don't view consciousness as a single thing
*  to be on or not. Right. So, so in the philosophical baby, which is my second book, I talked about this
*  a lot about this problem about, you know, what is it like to be a baby? Is there any way that we could
*  figure out what it's like to be a baby? Is it is there anything that all that it is like to be a
*  baby? And, and I think this is another kind of interesting example of the explorers exploit
*  distinction. So we know a lot about the kind of consciousness that's associated with a certain
*  kind of exploiting kind of behavior, things like planning or things like focus or things like
*  concentrated attention. And I think it's sometimes been tempting for philosophers and psychologists
*  to think that that kind of consciousness is the only thing that really counts as consciousness
*  at all. So that kind of self conscious, narrow, focused attention and someone like standing the
*  whole idea of the workplace, for example, the workspace, for example, is that essentially that
*  idea. And I think the right way to think about is that's one kind of consciousness. That's one kind
*  of phenomenology. But that's not the only kind of phenomenology. There's lots of the philosopher
*  Ned Balk has made this point, there's also just the phenomenology of being richly in the world
*  and experiencing everything that's going on around you without thinking in terms of attention and
*  focus. And I think there's good reason to believe that that kind of phenomenology is more like what
*  you're seeing in in children. And recently, I've gotten interested in psychedelics, because they're
*  a good example of a really systematic thing that you that that happens where you see systematic
*  brain changes and systematic phenomenological changes, where exactly what happens is that the
*  the goal directed planning focused attention kinds of systems seem to go offline. And I think,
*  you know, psychedelics are just a dramatic example of various kinds of mystical experience,
*  meditative experiences, other kinds of examples that you can point to that are like that,
*  the new Venice experience. And you know, the new Venice experience, by definition is not the
*  experience of you're going around and, and doing things and concentrating and focusing, it's that
*  you're open to things that are going on or that are going on around you. And again, it's a kind
*  of interesting trade off case where, if you think about something like open awareness meditation,
*  or meditation in general, the interesting paradox is that by not doing things by just,
*  you know, sitting in one literally not doing anything sitting in one place not moving,
*  and then using techniques like counting or breathing to keep even from doing stuff inside
*  of your head, you end up with this very striking phenomenology that's quite different from the
*  phenomenology of your everyday life, you'd think, well, that should just shut everything down. And
*  it does the opposite, it turns everything up. And I think that's a good model for what's going on
*  in childhood. So I think the kind of consciousness that's associated with things like plasticity,
*  learning information extraction, that kind of consciousness is really different from the kind
*  that's involved in action. And I think the former is much more like what you see with babies.
*  I mean, there's the joy I do remember the joy of being a child and for it, you know, feeling like
*  an hour was an entire day, etc. And, you know, are we going to be adding isolation, isolation tanks
*  to our labs so that every month for half an hour, we can drop a little acid and lay in the isolation
*  tank and that'll replace sabbaticals, especially if the pandemic keeps up?
*  Yeah, I think I would not suggest that as I've suggested before, I think the thing that we should
*  be doing is hanging out with three year olds more that I do think is a good, I mean, actually,
*  quite seriously, apart for me, part of the part of the difficulty of the pandemic has been that I
*  haven't been with my grandchildren. And one of the things that that I really have experienced,
*  I think other people experience as well is, you know, because I have a job and work to do that
*  involves a lot of planning and a lot of thinking and a lot of organizing. In a way, the only time
*  that I get to really escape from that is when I'm with my grandchildren, because if you're with a
*  two year old, like, you know, you're in the present moment, just because you have to be to be with a
*  to be to be with a two year old. So I think there's a kind of curious mindfulness way of being,
*  and also because the two year olds are open to so much, you know, you realize, because the two
*  year olds paying attention to the airplane in the sky and the little fluff on the ground, you're
*  paying attention to these things. So I think that's a really good way of getting a good way of
*  getting this sense of a broader, this sense of a broader perspective. But you know, also things
*  like meditation or travel or sabbaticals or times when you're not actually working, I think are
*  really good. And I do think one of the things that is a real sociological danger, especially in
*  academia and science now is that as the kind of meritocratic ratchet has, has sped up the sense of,
*  well, you could be working all the time, and you should be working all the time. And you should be,
*  you know, writing the extra paper or getting the extra publication out. I think in the long run,
*  that's, that's really damaging to science and, you know, being able to be more like the people
*  of leisure who started the Royal Society might be a better model. Do you make time? Do you set aside
*  time for play? Well, as I say, it's great when I have my grandchildren around because then I can my
*  Yeah, I know. But in your work life, though, you know, that's, I think it's quite challenging,
*  actually. I mean, I do do have have done that. I think I did that more in the past than I do
*  than I'm able to do now. But I do think it's really important. And I try to persuade my students
*  that that's what they should be doing. And then you go back to work. I know you have a lot of
*  work to do. You're a famous research grandmother scientist. And so I'm going to let you go. But
*  one last question. plans to build consciousness into the AI? Or is that just not part of the
*  project or your interest? You know, I think I do think it's still a great puzzle. I don't think
*  about what the relationship is between phenomenological experience and, and
*  computation and function. I don't think it's something that we can kind of say very much
*  about either way. So I don't think we I don't think there's any reason to believe that we couldn't
*  build consciousness into a functional system. After all, we're functional systems that have
*  consciousness. On the other hand, it's not obvious to me what exactly that you know, if we just have
*  a sufficiently complex system that it would automatically end up having phenomenology,
*  I do think seems odd. Those relationships are complicated. But I think the way we'll find out
*  about them is by is not by sort of a priori assuming that you have to or don't have to have
*  a particular kind of function for consciousness, it'll be by actually trying to figure out what
*  are some of the specific examples of the kinds of phenomenology that are associated with,
*  with particular particular kinds of function. My friend, Peter Goffrey Smith has a new book out
*  in a book about octopuses that I think is a very nice way of approaching this, which is sort of
*  think about all the incredible variety of biological systems that we know about and think what kinds of
*  phenomenology might go with that kind of that kind of experience. And that might tell us something
*  about what would happen if an artificial system as well. You haven't seen that Netflix program,
*  my my teacher, the octopus, have you? No, I've heard about it, but I recommend it. Yeah, I'm
*  willing to believe that cephalopods have lots of secrets to tell us. Yeah, pretty amazing stuff.
*  Allison, thanks for spending the time and I'm gonna have to do this exploring this with me.
*  Yes, well, always happy, happy to do it. And it was a really great conversation. Thanks.
