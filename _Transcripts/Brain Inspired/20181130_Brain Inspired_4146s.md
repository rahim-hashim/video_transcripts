# BI 020 Anna Wexler: Stimulate Your Brain?
**Brain Inspired:** [November 30, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ec0xb32-aw)
*  I'm skeptical of the idea that we'll one day all be walking around with very accurate,
*  very portable, lightweight monitoring devices that are going to read everything that we
*  say.
*  So it was a wooden box with this battery used at home and it was sold to cure hundreds of
*  different ailments.
*  And people would turn it on, hold the two electrodes in their hands or either place
*  them at different places on their bodies to get a shock.
*  It was called taking a shock.
*  Welcome everyone.
*  I am Paul Middlebrooks.
*  Are you right now running current from a 9 volt battery through your head?
*  Are you wearing an EEG cap while you monitor your own brain waves?
*  Do you just enjoy listening to people talk about this kind of stuff?
*  Well you're in the right place today.
*  Anna Wexler is a postdoc at UPenn where she studies the world of neurotechnology and especially
*  direct to consumer neurotechnology.
*  That is gadgets, apps and the like currently marketed and sold without regulation that
*  you can buy and self-administer at home to try to enhance your own cognitive abilities.
*  Abilities like playing a musical instrument, improving your working memory, getting better
*  at meditating and so on.
*  Or you can try to treat your depression or any number of cognitive ailments.
*  Anna has an interesting background.
*  She starting as an undergraduate co-wrote, directed, produced and edited a documentary
*  film called Unorthodox about how spending a year in orthodox Jewish studies in Israel
*  transforms American rather unorthodox Jewish teenagers.
*  Although there's a lot more subtext throughout the film.
*  She has traveled a ton and written extensively about neuroscience and more including a lot
*  about what we'll talk about today.
*  Most of her academic work has focused on transcranial direct current stimulation which is pumping
*  tiny currents into your head like I described a moment ago.
*  But she has wide interests and knowledge which we also explore.
*  We talk about what neurotechnology is and how it's tricky to define.
*  The industry of cognitive enhancement with its different products and claims about what
*  those products can do for your brain.
*  How those products might be regulated.
*  What kinds of people are using them in their homes.
*  And of course we didn't cover the extent of it.
*  You can learn more about her work through her website annawexler.com or follow her on
*  Twitter at Anna underscore Wexler.
*  All of this you can also find in the show notes at braininspired.co slash podcast slash
*  20.
*  A special thank you this week to another generous listener Satpreet.
*  Thank you for supporting the show through Patreon.
*  If you dear listener find value in this little journey and would like to support the show
*  for as little as two dollars per month go to braininspired.co and click the red Patreon
*  button there.
*  And you know for every new supporter I get to say to my wife see I told you.
*  Okay happy self stimulating everyone.
*  Since Anna was asking me questions as well along the way here is my somewhat more personally
*  revealing conversation with Anna.
*  All right Anna Wexler welcome to the podcast and thanks for being here.
*  Thank you.
*  I think that I have this right.
*  You can tell me where I'm wrong here.
*  So it was a rainy night and you were sitting in your editing room and you're putting the
*  final touches on the edits for your documentary unorthodox.
*  You strap on your transcranial direct current stimulator.
*  You flip a switch on and you have this epiphany.
*  You've got to get back into academia.
*  But you think to yourself what should I study?
*  And suddenly you detect the smell of burning flesh and you realize it's your own.
*  The brain stimulator.
*  It's burning you and you have your second epiphany.
*  I need to study neuro technology you think.
*  That's how it all worked right.
*  It would have been nice if it worked like that.
*  You know ending one project and starting a new one.
*  The reality was that the documentary film I was working on unorthodox that took nine
*  years that extended into my PhD.
*  Holy cow.
*  So it's not like I finished it and then decided to do a PhD.
*  That's a labor of love.
*  It was a labor of love.
*  Yeah definitely a labor of love.
*  But I was living so at the time I was working on the film I was living in Tel Aviv and working
*  as a freelance science and travel writer.
*  I was writing so I was working mostly with neuroscientists and writing about neuroscientists
*  and neuroscience research.
*  One of the things that really interested me was brain computer interfaces and the potential
*  impact that they would have on society.
*  And so I decided I wanted to do my own.
*  So I saw the PhD or a PhD as a way to spend more time doing in depth research on a project.
*  Whereas as a freelance writer I was commissioned to write certain articles just short articles.
*  Anyway the short of it is I applied to do a PhD at MIT in the history anthropology science
*  technology and society department thinking I wanted to study brain computer interfaces.
*  Got into the program started the PhD realized there wasn't really enough meat yet there
*  in the brain PCI world for me to do a PhD.
*  It was you know the stuff that I've been reading was very speculative.
*  And at the same time I began to hear about the do it yourself brain stimulation movement.
*  I thought oh that would be a great idea for a thesis is something that's happening right
*  now is something that I could study kind of from a sociological perspective.
*  So that's that's kind of the long story of how I got into studying what I what I studied
*  in you actually I mean after you got your undergraduate degree and then you took this
*  five years not a break because you were working and traveling and writing about travel and
*  about science which puts you kind of like me when I because I had probably six years
*  before I started my PhD and you were you one of the older PhD candidates in your program.
*  This is completely for my satisfaction here.
*  Yeah yeah I was one of the older candidates in my program and I think you see a lot of
*  people coming in straight out of their undergraduate degree coming into their PhD because they're
*  not quite sure what else to do and then not all those people but I see some of them kind
*  of flounder you know at a certain time in the middle of the PhD they think is this really
*  what I want to do you know things like that but I think when you have time outside of
*  academia and then you come back you're you can be a bit more focused.
*  That's not necessarily true in all cases.
*  It's not but I agree I mean I the people who went straight from undergraduate are the people
*  who you dropped out or were miserable or both you know often often.
*  Yeah I'd say often not always you know you could go either way.
*  No that's true I was jealous of the people who really shone you know coming right from undergrad.
*  Yeah I mean they're younger right if they're superstars they'll get everything done earlier.
*  They'll get you know well yeah yeah there is that kind of shining but I just meant internally
*  shone you know they're happy to be there.
*  Oh oh okay yeah what did you do is this is this like a Alec Baldwin where we like chat back and forth?
*  Yeah we can Alec Baldwin.
*  Okay what's his podcast here that here's the thing.
*  Oh I don't know he had a podcast yeah he seems like pretty busy guy I guess.
*  Yeah yeah we can chat back and forth I mean mainly.
*  Is this more like a conversation or is this like you asking questions of me?
*  I'm happy to have a go either way.
*  It's in between I think but it's more on the me asking questions of you but feel free to ask me
*  anything.
*  I'll edit it out if I think my stuff is boring so you know.
*  Well you probably have a bias to think your stuff is boring even though it may not be.
*  Pretty heavy pretty heavy bias.
*  What did you do for the six years?
*  Oh well I was a poor undergraduate student and so I knew I wouldn't be able to get into graduate
*  school anyway and I had no idea what I wanted to do so I got an undergraduate degree and
*  I kind of dropped out of airspace engineering ended up in a molecular biology undergraduate
*  degree they didn't have neuroscience in my university of Texas when I was doing
*  undergraduate back in the 60s so I worked in a clinical laboratory for a while and when I.
*  You weren't doing undergrad in the 60s.
*  I was I'm joking yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  When I decided I wanted to go to graduate school I realized my GPA wasn't good enough and I'd have
*  to work in laboratories to do so so I got really lucky this woman Carol Odie took a chance on me
*  and hired me into her laboratory as a technician so I worked in her lab and then I worked my way
*  toward neuroscience labs and then I had great letters of recommendation to get to grad school
*  so a lot of it was working toward getting into graduate school but I wasted a good few years
*  there and not knowing what I was doing it sounds like fun having different lab experience along
*  the way it was valuable yeah okay enough about me so so what I consider what you do I kind of
*  just want to ask you about your rv trip but yeah this is not about me hey well we can have another
*  Skype a later time we can get into that later yeah yeah so what I consider that you do among
*  other things is really what you're studying is this is sociology and culture and and you study
*  the ethical concerns therein and you know how regulation should proceed in these matters but
*  this is pretty uncharted territory I don't know if you'd call it a new sociology and a new culture
*  so there's lots to think about here you mean you mean the topic is uncharted or the regulation and
*  ethical concerns of the technology that like neurotechnology that is being used today and
*  especially being used direct to consumer people self-stimulating at home but so you can tell me
*  what you if you agree or disagree with what I said and then just define neurotechnology for us if you
*  could so so you started with the hardest question is how do you define neurotechnology it's a really
*  tough question right because you could say it's a technology that affects the brain in some way or
*  that utilizes results from neuroscience research or something like that right to impact the brain
*  but then you know if you look at it every every thing affects the brain in some way my computer
*  you know affects the brain when I'm sitting and writing an email right that's affecting my brain
*  function so I would say I don't have a definition of neurotechnology maybe that's one of the
*  problems the challenges yeah that's certainly one of the challenges I have worked recently in a paper
*  that's under review to come up with the definition of direct to consumer neurotechnology so the way
*  we define it in a recent paper that we have under review is the set of products and by that we mean
*  devices software and applications that are marketed and sold directly to consumers
*  without necessitating the physician as intermediary and they're marketed for the
*  purposes of modulating cognition or effective or mental states okay I think that's a pretty
*  pretty good definition yeah and and we say here is that what distinguishes these products as
*  neurotechnologies is that they appeal to the fruits of the brain and cognitive sciences
*  so this is not like let's say a crystal that you can buy in Sedona that may be marketed to improve
*  your brain function right because you could argue that could be a neurotechnology too and at least
*  in the way that it's marketed but the products that I've been interested in looking at are ones
*  that really appeal to neuroscience that are kind of sold within aura of science and specifically
*  brain science oh you said aura right after you're talking about the crystals very nice
*  okay so that encompasses a lot of what we're going to talk about today and in recent years you know
*  this better than I do but money has been flowing into for one brain stimulation devices transcranial
*  direct current stimulation but the money that's been flowing into that is relatively low with
*  respect to other neurotechnology it's like brain training games you know like luminosity and brain
*  enhancing lumosity lumosity yeah and brain enhancing drugs like the nootropics world
*  before we talk about the self stimulating people at home stimulating the brains and stuff
*  just in the overall big picture what's your take on the on like brain training games
*  and the nootropics and that industry and all of it uh I guess I think about them in different ways so
*  I mean so when I think with when I think of brain training games I just think of their main struggle
*  which has been you know you can improve on on one task right you train on one task you can improve
*  on the on that task are those benefits you know or is that improvement generalizable to other tasks
*  and I think that's been the main outstanding question with brain training games so for me
*  it's not a yay or nay it's you know if it's generalizable then sure why not but it may not
*  but it may not be and I don't think there's good evidence yet that it is in all domains and it's a
*  difficult question to ask and to assess and what does it mean to be generalizable and how do you
*  even identify the domain that you're you know generalizing to and how do you study it I mean
*  yeah so that's what that's that's like the first thing that comes to mind when I think about
*  the brain training world that's interesting because the brain training game world that it's
*  interesting because I just uh had Dean Bonamono on the show a couple episodes ago now and he
*  researches time and how it works in the brain and he I don't know if we talked about it but
*  it's it's known that you can like if you want to guess a 50 millisecond interval right you can
*  practice that and you can improve at guessing the 50 millisecond interval but that doesn't
*  generalize to the 100 millisecond interval or any other interval you can only improve on that one
*  interval so even in a domain like time it's a very specific improvement that happens so yeah that's
*  actually really fascinating I agree so so that's what I think about with brain training games and
*  so Lumosity and a few other companies got in trouble a few years ago with the Federal Trade
*  Commission because they were making certain claims that according to FTC wasn't substantiated by
*  evidence so what you see now is they tone down their claims so that they don't claim that their
*  product will improve your cognitive function they'll say things like actually I don't know
*  I don't know exactly what they say because you're not a sleazy marketer that's why you don't know
*  yeah but they've toned down they've certainly toned down their claim so that's what I think
*  in the brain training world so now you'll see if you look at the at the major players in that
*  market you'll see these kind of watered down claims Neutropics I'll say I've sort of been
*  tangentially familiar with them it's not an area that I've studied specifically so I don't know a
*  lot about them but I will say in general the supplement world is very interesting because
*  and you know Neutropics are supplements because they're very lightly regulated they're almost
*  not regulated at all so FDA doesn't oversee what's inside them whether it's safe whether
*  it's effective so if you go to CVS or you go to the mall and you see a GNC all those products
*  that are on the shelves nobody really knows what's there's nobody overseeing what's in them
*  and if what's claimed to be in them is actually in them and there's actually a great website called
*  consumer lab they're a company that tests what's inside supplements and whether the supplement
*  manufacturers are whether what the supplement manufacturers claim that's in them is actually
*  in them so it's a great website and the more I learn about supplements the more scared I get
*  I will say yeah so I mean that is a really concerning area that people are being having
*  to go to emergency rooms because they've taken certain supplements or there's been too much of
*  a certain compound in the supplement that that causes problem I mean that's where like most of
*  the money is flowing into any you know the biggest industry players are the brain training games and
*  the Neutropics Neutropics I guess you say I would say that the biggest industry right now is I mean
*  judging by amount of money that's been invested is probably in the consumer facing potential for
*  consumer facing BCIs so Facebook's invested a bunch of money in brain computer interface Neuralink
*  right but those aren't like products yet I guess I'm thinking about products yeah they're not on
*  the market so yes so yes those are the bigger players for sure okay so let's let's shift a
*  little bit and you've written a lot about transcranial direct current stimulation
*  so let's talk about that in in this realm here so you want to just talk briefly about what it is
*  what is transcranial direct current stimulation sure tdcs transcranial direct current stimulation
*  is a technique a method of brain stimulation that sends low levels of current through the head
*  we're talking like double a battery levels or a nine volt battery levels often nine volt battery
*  yeah there's some debate over whether it's actually sending current into the brain and
*  not being shunted through the scalp but you know the going consensus has been that it is
*  sending very low levels of current to to the brain good so the idea really is that it's
*  putting your neurons in a slightly depolarized state so that it's getting them more ready to
*  fire so if you're putting current through a certain area of your brain say that's great at
*  backflips then you're going to be doing you know you're ready to do a better backflip if you have
*  the tdcs stimulator going right yes and the converse is thought to be true for the inhibitory
*  effect so that might be true for the anode so the area the brain region beneath where the current
*  is thought to be flowing into the brain or the brain region beneath where the anode the other
*  one electrode is placed so that the current's flowing in through the anode and out through the
*  cathode so in the region beneath the anode it's thought that there's a depolarizing effect but in
*  the region beneath the cathode where the current's flowing out there may be a converse effect or
*  maybe making it harder for you to perform backflips yeah you land on your face if both were on the
*  motor course that's not usually the case all right we really don't know but that's that's that's very
*  simplistic view and yeah that's the working model right now but it's complicated by a variety
*  of other things like what drugs you're on oh sure shockingly so yeah it is it is being used a lot in
*  the academic world it's being studied a lot in fact the last lab that i worked for i overlapped
*  just a little bit they were just starting some work using tdcs in non-human primates oh interesting
*  yeah and trying to track you know to see if behavioral changes ensued this is like an eye
*  movement lab but how you know how it's used in the academic world how how do people use tdcs in the
*  academic world so it really breaks down into two kinds of studies so studies in clinical populations
*  and studies in healthy population so it's in in clinical studies it's used to see if there's any
*  effect for treating things like depression or chronic pain or schizophrenia or autism i'd say
*  the most promising evidence right now seems to be for depression and chronic pain but there's you
*  could probably find a study that's tried tdcs for pretty much every disease or disorder that you can
*  name they're cheap they're cheap for labs to buy too they're cheap for labs to buy and i think it's
*  important to mention it's not it's still it's an experimental technique it's not fda approved to
*  treat any indication so this is not a product that's on the market that you'll go to your doctor
*  and receive right so still experimental so so yeah so there's clinical populations clinical
*  studies on the one hand and then scientists interested in understanding cognition and behavior
*  also use it in healthy populations so to study the effects on language memory motor skills creativity
*  executive function things like that and that literature you'll find a lot of studies claiming
*  that tdcs has a a kind of cognitive enhancement effect and so there's a lot of overlap actually
*  with people using it in their homes so you can buy these things direct to consumer have them shipped
*  to your house i don't know if they come with instruction manuals some do some don't oh is that
*  right so how do people use it at home and there is a lot of overlap with what you just said yeah so
*  at home so basically the home use the home use of tdcs breaks down in the same way that the scientific
*  use does so partially for treatment in a study i did i found that about 40 percent of users utilized
*  it for treatment and i believe there were about three quarters that utilized it for some kind of
*  cognitive enhancement effect so that also broke down really nicely along male and female because
*  all the males used it for cognitive enhancement and all the females used it for depression yes
*  not all but more well yeah more males and females and vice versa it was interesting yeah so that was
*  that was a pretty interesting finding so okay so so people are buying these things at home so
*  it's recent this most recent surge is recent so when did people start really buying these things
*  and experimenting with themselves at home so i've traced the start of the whole idea of home users
*  you know using these things on themselves back to late 2011 early 2012 which was when the do it
*  yourself tdcs movement started to coalesce is that when the maker movement really took off too i
*  can't remember it was a little before that okay i think that the maker movement so so i think the
*  seeds were in place for well the maker movement was there before that diy bio had just started
*  and diy tdcs comes a little bit after that but it's interesting to think about
*  you know all these movements and kind of arising at the same time because there is some overlap
*  between them so it started late 2011 early 2012 and that's when we see a reddit forum dedicated
*  to tdcs there's websites and blogs and videos that come out dedicated to tdcs and at this time
*  people were still making devices at home so most of the content that you would see was you know how
*  to make a tdcs device go to radioshack when radioshack still existed buy the parts put them
*  together here's the diagram late i think it was summer 2013 was when the first wearable device
*  came out and by wearable i mean you didn't have to put anything together you could just put it
*  right on your head this was the the focus version one prior to that there had been in earlier 2013
*  and 2012 there had been a number of individuals entrepreneurial individuals who decided to start
*  selling tdcs device kits so they would you know package a battery and some wires together and
*  you just basically plug plug everything in at home but the the focus device was this kind of
*  sleek looking headset you could just put it out you know pull it out of the box put it on your
*  head and it connected to your phone so that was about 2013 and now i mean i haven't checked in
*  the last year but um i'd say there's probably at least a dozen maybe 20 devices that are on the
*  market sold for tdcs so you've written about how this is actually cyclical you know the idea of
*  pumping electricity through various parts of our body but our brains is not that's not new um so
*  you've written about the medical battery so what is that what's the medical battery when was that
*  so the medical battery is very interesting so that was the late 1800s early 1900s and the use of
*  electricity at home um at that time was extremely popular um so if you could put yourself back in
*  that time period was tesla alive i can't remember was tesla alive at that point edison was that later
*  i have it all mixed up i'm not uh because well you know home electricity well yes i guess it
*  was because electricity was making its way into the home into the homes of americans i should say
*  i'm talking about the united states when i when i talk about right right this um it was making
*  its way into the homes in the late 1800s and early 1900s like the last decade or two of the 1800s so
*  it started in the wealthier homes um they had electricity first um and then it you know gradually
*  moved its way to other people's you know gradually spread okay so these the medical
*  battery was not something that was plugged into the wall it actually became came to seem sort of
*  outdated once there was electricity uh widespread electricity um in people's homes but yeah so at
*  this time electricity was very very exciting it was in the 20s and 30s that alternating current
*  was discovered and that the precursor to a battery was discovered then so this was in
*  the early 1800s so suddenly you had a way to both store to generate electricity to store it and
*  release it on demand yeah so that was the early part of the 1800s and that kind of really paved
*  the way for certain med actually people had been interested in medical electricity since static
*  electricity which was the middle of the 1700s since that was i don't want to say discovered
*  because people knew about sat electricity before that but but since there were ways to capture it
*  and kind of play with it that was in the mid 1700s anyway yeah so so early 1800s alternating
*  current now exists direct current now exists at the time they called direct current galvanic
*  current after galvani alternating current was ferratic current after faraday so these so these
*  devices exist that can generate and store electricity and people began using them for
*  medical purposes and essentially trying to cure different ailments with electricity and it was
*  thought that electricity would loosen any blockages that you had in your system it would sort of get
*  things yeah get things flowing and so the real heyday of these home medical batteries which were
*  devices that were probably about the size of a shoe box is the best way to describe them they're
*  heavy wooden things with batteries were much larger back then so today you have a a double a
*  battery that's you know quite small maybe the size of your pinky let's say right depending on how
*  big your pinky is back then i would say the batteries that were used in these devices were
*  about the size of a a really big burrito like think of the biggest burrito that you could buy
*  that's stocked full with everything that's the size of the that these batteries were so it's a
*  wooden box with this battery used at home and it was sold to cure hundreds of different ailments
*  and people would turn it on hold the two electrodes in their hands or either place them at different
*  places on their bodies to get a shock it was called taking a shock like you take your medicine
*  you would take a shock oh man i want to go take a shock now see what happens loosen loosen up
*  whatever is tight inside me yeah there are hundreds of companies selling these devices so this was a
*  big business so you could it was something you could go see your doctor to get you know you could
*  get electrical medicine or you could buy a device for use at home as well okay now we just get
*  oxycodone and stuff right so you know just yes yes so you argue rightly so i think that
*  self-stimulating should be understood in terms of like the larger context of like diy do it yourself
*  and citizen science and life hacking movements why is that what why do you think that it it should
*  be understood in this larger umbrella well i think there's just a lot of similarity i mean there's
*  similarities and differences between the movement so i think understanding where the movements are
*  similar and where they might be different is useful for thinking about policy you know how to
*  navigate the rise of diy medical or diy science movements so one main difference let's say between
*  diy bio and diy tdcs is in doi bio biology it's mostly groups of people coming together often
*  around a shared space and they're experimenting but they're doing it not to improve themselves
*  they're doing it for tinkering to make cool stuff maybe to do some experiments that they're
*  interested in but in diy tdcs the people are the the diyers are motivated by self-improvement so
*  whether they're using it for enhancement or they're using it for treatment they're trying to
*  improve themselves in some way so the movements are very similar in many ways but i think there's
*  also these underlying differences in in motivation okay and i think so that can inform policy in
*  terms of um if you're making policy for you know if you're trying to restrict someone doing something
*  just you know if someone's doing it for kicks right and you're trying to restrict them that's
*  one thing but if you're trying to restrict somebody who's really desperate and is trying
*  to self-treat let's say their depression that's intractable that person's going to go to much
*  greater lengths to try and use that device or use that technology than someone who's you know not
*  as personally motivated these are hard questions i'm glad that you're thinking about these things
*  instead of me so with tdcs in particular what are the the dangers or unintended consequences of using
*  it burning is one that's reported by a small number of users do they not wet the sponge what how do you
*  get burned i don't understand so some of the early devices i won't name the company's names but um
*  the electrode size was very small and you know yeah so some of the some people sometimes there's
*  no directions to wet the sponge or you wet it with water instead of saline solution right or those
*  droids are really small but usually you could i mean if you're aware that burning is a risk
*  you should be able to feel that you know there's something getting very hot on your
*  um for it unless you're very distracted which might be but there's also burns reported in
*  the scientific literature if you look there there's uh redness there's burns there's headaches there's
*  tingling tingling and that's what home users also report similar issues yeah the unknown so i'd say
*  the main unknown actually i'll start by saying that home users actually don't deviate too much
*  from the parameters that are used in the laboratory settings in a number of ways in one way they deviate
*  a lot so when it comes to current level they mostly stay at around two milliamps which is
*  roughly what's used in scientific studies in terms of length of session 15 to 20 minutes is the most
*  common which is also probably the most common in scientific studies but where they depart is in the
*  number of sessions that they have used tdcs for so in laboratory studies of tdcs especially for
*  cognitive enhancement so in healthy populations there's often only one or two you can't you can't
*  get undergraduates to come back to the lab yeah like more than a few times right right
*  clinical studies are sometimes a bit more but but home users really at least some of them
*  stimulate a lot more frequently and so it's unknown you know what that level of stimulation
*  does or what chronic stimulation what what the effects of chronic stimulation like that are
*  somewhat related to that as well it's unknown the long-term effects of these things as well
*  in terms of let's say that you you stimulate and you do learn piano faster right but you don't know
*  what you're unlearning you don't know what you're becoming worse at so increasing the
*  neural synchrony for instance in one part of your brain well more more resources are devoted to that
*  part of the brain and you just for one thing like you said on the other end of the of the electrical
*  device those neurons are more hyper polarized less active and so whatever area that is maybe
*  that's getting worse but even beyond that when you train for one thing you might become worse at other
*  things and it's just a such an open subject that it's really impossible to say what could be going
*  on yeah and some have argued that there's uh the brain is there's like a zero-sum game where you
*  know if you're improving one area you may be doing that at the cost of the detriment of another
*  yeah but it's unknown it could be that when i text on my phone i am you know by devoting my
*  resources to to that i am i could be doing that at the detriment to something else it could be
*  that everything we do of course right of course comes with the loss of a of a other cognitive
*  ability not loss but you know negatively affects another cognitive ability in some way your ability
*  to juggle is declining right now as you speak to me i i know so to juggle yeah i'm not very good
*  at juggling anyway okay so uh you you recently did a survey and i think this is um i think it
*  was your 2018 paper in the journal of cognitive enhancement where you did a survey and asked what
*  kinds of people used transcranial direct current simulation at home and we've talked about this a
*  little bit um you've asked who what kinds of people use it and why do they use it you got
*  i'm surprised at this you got seven out of ten companies to participate in this survey
*  on the condition of anonymity how did you get those seven to participate it seems and that
*  they're anonymous but it seems like they wouldn't want to participate yeah so i think that happened
*  in two ways one i had published an earlier paper on the practices of do-it-yourself brain stimulation
*  that consisted of interviews with diyers and i think people in the field at least the people
*  who ran the companies and the users recognized that in contrast to some of the other bioethicists who
*  are out there saying hey guys don't do this you're being stupid you're being reckless my paper was
*  focused on the data i didn't reserve judgment on these individuals i actually thought and still
*  think that they're quite intelligent if you're able to either make this device or do it in your
*  home you know you have to have some kind of electrical knowledge or engineering ability
*  at least in the early stages or a willingness paired with a willingness to learn right there
*  was like a bar it wasn't you know you had to go seek this out but but anyway so i think that was
*  one reason right i was different than other people and there were a lot of people saying don't do
*  this you guys are stupid that was probably most most of the voices at the time were saying
*  something like that so that was one piece of it the other piece was that we shared the data with
*  them so they had an interest without any names so it was anonymized data from their company so
*  if there were 50 respondents from company x that company got data from those 50 respondents without
*  any identifying information oh so that's that's some marketing research for them free marketing
*  search exactly but they had they had no say in what we were gonna i mean we we actually sent we
*  piloted the survey and we sent it to people for feedback but they had no say in what we asked what
*  we were going to report there there was no impact that they had on the survey there was no financial
*  exchanges so it's like we're doing study if you participate you get all this extra data from your
*  company only well i mean it's interesting data i mean and actually it's pretty impressive you sent
*  out about around 10 000 emails to people and you got a open rate or a response rate of almost three
*  and a half percent is that do i have that right yes it was aggregate response of three and a half or
*  3.9 that's like pretty good normal for uh like email marketing you know so there's nothing in
*  it for them so that was pretty good is it good for him i mean it's actually lower it's a lower
*  response rate relative to other targeted studies of certain populations but i think right relative
*  to the amount of email that i like i don't i barely open any email from yeah these aren't
*  people who like signed up for your email list in particular so this is like these are cold emails
*  that you're sending these people so i mean that's that's pretty impressive so so there are around
*  350 people who took the survey if it's okay let's just talk about a few of the notable results here
*  so we already talked about the um about two-thirds of people used it for cognitive enhancement
*  right and about a third used it for something therapeutic mostly depression but also anxiety
*  and adhd and and i mentioned earlier that the fallout was the you know the male were more often
*  the cognitive enhancement seekers and females were more often the therapeutic seekers in that
*  fallout can i pause can i actually pause you before it before that point the depression point i think
*  is interesting to linger on for a second because almost all these products are marketed for
*  enhancement not for treatment and so the fact that we found that there's almost a third of users who
*  had ever used the device so we asked people if they use the device so amongst those who had ever
*  used the device at least once about a third had used it to self-treat depression and that was a
*  far higher number than i was expecting because the devices aren't marketed for that purpose but
*  people who are depressed like you mentioned earlier are desperate for respite you know for some relief
*  from the depression too so maybe they seek it out more i mean who knows but you know and then
*  and these are overlapping numbers because i'm gonna this is not going to sum to one but a quarter
*  of the people also responded that they were just curious or you know we're self-experimenting or
*  the novelty of it for instance yeah that's also important because in bioethics or neuroethics we
*  just you know we tend to categorize people as treatment or enhancement are they enhancing or
*  treating i mean it's a very tough distinction to make anyway like what where is the border between
*  those two but even just showing that not everyone who buys these devices are even using it specifically
*  for these purposes some are just buying it because they think it's interesting and they want to just
*  try it out they heard about it right yeah i think that's just interesting to keep in mind
*  i mean one of the more surprising results was that the average age of users i would have guessed
*  oh late 20s early 30s average but but it was 45 yeah crazy you know the study very well here
*  i take notes you know yeah no it's great yeah it was it was very surprising because all the
*  media portrayals and previous study depicted the typical user as 20 something dude who's
*  interested in cognitive enhancement and you know is on reddit and the mean age was really just
*  really surprising see these are like you mentioned in the paper or you surmise
*  the baby boomers right who are using these products and a lot of the older users might
*  be treating themselves for cognitive decline and trying to get back up to speed where whereas the
*  earlier i don't know if it was i don't remember if it was bimodal or if it was a
*  normal distribution you know i actually think so we had a question did you use
*  uh tdcs to enhance treat or restore it wasn't asked like that we it was have right the wording
*  was more carefully constructed of have you ever used tdcs for this purpose for that purpose
*  but we we did get at treat enhance and restore and so there was i forget exactly how many it was
*  there was a proportion who had who selected restoration so restoring cognitive abilities
*  and i think there was a small difference in age but it wasn't it wasn't that meaningful it was
*  still we're still talking mid-40s i don't remember exactly what it was but i just thought of a caveat
*  though maybe uh the older participants were more likely to open an email i'm not sure who knows
*  could be yeah yeah and and let's just run down some of the results on the effects that people
*  perceived at least right so the way that most people use this stuff they're not actually
*  measuring their own performance over time they either didn't measure it all or they measured
*  via self observation so there's no objectivity here obviously yeah um and almost almost half of
*  the people assessed their self-treatment as successful as working in some fashion that's a
*  little higher than i expected but for most people it didn't meet their expectations going in
*  yes and i think that's reflected when you actually look at the breakdown of
*  so the question was how successful did you find tbcs to be or some variant of that phrasing and
*  um the answers were on a one to five scale very successful to unsuccessful and then the middle was
*  not sure and the highest category of response was somewhat successful and i think i believe the
*  second one was not sure so when you have this somewhat successful it's not people saying it's
*  very successful it's they're saying it was probably probably successful and there was a big not sure
*  category so what that tells me is that it's not a technology that people find to be
*  overwhelmingly effective right and uh often you know if you're going to strap one of those on
*  you're going to be practicing the piano more anyway so these could be just practice effects etc
*  so there's a lot more to learn here but it's really interesting stuff it's a really interesting
*  breakdown yeah and uh those who used it for treatment found it more successful as those
*  who used it for enhancement oh that's interesting so that could be for a number of reasons it could
*  be tbcs is actually more effective for a certain treatment than for enhancement it could be that
*  the placebo effect is greater for treaters than for enhancers it could be that it's equally successful
*  but perhaps the effects are more salient equally successful or unsuccessful equally successful but
*  that the effects are more salient um for people who are say depressed right so you might notice an
*  improvement in depression more than you might notice a five percent increase on your working
*  memory right so it could be a lot of reasons for that and yeah again it's self-report but i think
*  in this case self-report is actually the interesting measure to get it uh am i going to get you in
*  trouble uh if i ask if you've self-experimented i've tried some of the devices i haven't used any of
*  them regularly i tried the think when it was out i've tried a few others i'm not sure if it had any
*  effect i didn't really do any kind of testing self-observation or anything yeah well so okay
*  so this is um one of the things that you do in in your writing a lot is consider the ethical
*  implications and and how we would begin regulating these types of things so anna how would we begin
*  regulating these types of things well it's tough well the first question is what's the problem
*  right why would we want to regulate it right so instead of saying we need to regulate it which
*  actually is the way that some people you know some people are just arguing we need to regulate it
*  let's be clear you do think we need to regulate it is that right i'm not sure that we do okay okay
*  because you write objectively about it so it's hard to know you know your your opinions i know i kind
*  of stay uh yeah smart uh well yes i write about so i'm trained in the social sciences and there
*  it's actually a sin to take a a stand either way to say what we should do to make a normative claim
*  sure um so i'm trying to uh not do that so much anymore especially because now i'm in a bioethics
*  department where you actually are supposed to say what's right and what's wrong all the time so there
*  must be a happy medium where you don't always say what's right and what's wrong definitively as if
*  you know the answers to everything but yes anyway um so in terms of regulation yes so i think that
*  the starting question is really what's the harm and so so rather than starting from this is crazy
*  people are doing this we should regulate it which is what a lot of people argued things like that
*  i think the starting point is well what are we concerned about what are objectively what are the
*  harms that people are experiencing and so that's actually what motivates my sociological work is
*  taking these questions that are of interest to bioethics and policy and then bringing in sociology
*  to say like what is the actual harm yeah uh and where is there potential for harm right so if we
*  look at just safety or side effects safety and risk these are very big terms that people define
*  in different ways and talk about in different ways but when we're looking at short-term very
*  physical side effects that's what a lot of people talk remain when they talk about safety it's that
*  people have skin burns a small portion of people use these devices skin burn small price to pay i
*  think yeah uh and then you could think about unknown you know the unknown effects of chronic
*  use as a potential harm but actually there's unknown effects of long-term use of drugs pretty
*  much any drug you take nobody studied the potential long-term cognitive impact of those that's not
*  assessed in standard clinical trials standard clinical trials assess certain outcomes and
*  you know adverse events which are really side effects short-term physical effects that can
*  be measured or quantified in some way right so when you look at it like that it's hard to point
*  to a real overwhelming need for strict regulation i would say in this case the question is what if
*  they were to be regulated where would that regulation come from and who has regulatory
*  jurisdiction over them in the u.s and the so the regulatory question is whether these devices are
*  medical devices and therefore fall under fda jurisdiction or if they're consumer products and
*  therefore they're not subject to fda medical device laws and so then you have to go and ask
*  what makes something a medical device what is the definition of medical device so the fda judges
*  whether or not something is a medical device not by its mechanism of action but by looking into how
*  a marketer manufacturer markets the product so hang on i just want to yeah let's give you an
*  example yeah okay yeah go ahead well i'll just you know raised my ire with the marketing because
*  marketing's job is to get around stuff like that and to communicate in a way that you're going to
*  buy the product and the company won't get regulated so it's just teaching them how to market yeah i
*  mean you could write so companies write around the regulation and that's what happened with
*  supplements too right so the line between excuse me between what's a supplement and what's a drug
*  is not that big you know the claims that supplements can make and the claims that drugs can make so a
*  supplement can market themselves as reducing the appearance of wrinkles whereas a drug can market
*  a drug if you say you're reducing wrinkles and that's actually a medical claim then you're
*  considered a drug under fda regulation but if you're a softer claim right reducing the appearance
*  of wrinkles then you're a supplement and there's very very little oversight you can go straight to
*  market be right on the shelves without showing safety or efficacy or anything like that i have
*  got to get in a supplement game here this is uh really supplements are really crazy so so similarly
*  with devices it's all about how you market the device so if you market your device for enhancement
*  the question is is whether that's a medical claim or not it's probably not but right right now it's
*  the wild west so there's no i mean that's what kind of you're working toward when when regulators
*  catch up and they start to think about these things they're going to be reading your papers
*  to make these regulations so it's an interesting position you're in yeah and i mean i'm in contact
*  with the fda and the fda is thinking about this and they've had several works or at least one
*  workshop on the topic but i think for them it's also a question of resources um you know is this
*  is this a need that um they should put more uh effort into so they actually have a guidance
*  that's out and they basically said that if a device is low risk and it's marketed for wellness
*  purposes not for medical indications um even though it technically could fall within their
*  jurisdiction they're going to exercise enforcement discretion which basically means they're not going
*  to bother with them they're not going to take a look so the question is whether tdcs devices meet
*  this criteria are tdcs devices they're certainly marketed for wellness purposes right are they low
*  risk and in the recent version of the guidance fda said they would not be classified as low risk
*  so basically fda was saying tdcs devices do not meet the criteria for this exemption
*  but at the same time they have not taken any action against the devices against the manufacturers so
*  it's a bit of a confusing point where it is now but it but again it all comes down to how
*  how a manufacturer markets a device you know is it for medical indications is it for enhancement
*  and so now what we're seeing in the eeg space and um in in other spaces is is products and devices
*  being marketed for wellness which are sort of like the supplement dietary supplement versions of
*  medical devices like the same way that the relationship between dietary supplements and
*  drugs and marketing is the same way that similar to the relationship between these
*  direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies and medical devices we were my grandfather's printer went out
*  and he needs a new printer and my grandmother said well i was watching the tv and they said the best
*  place to buy a printer is best buy and it was because it was a best buy commercial you know
*  and so like people we're just so i mean she's of the older generation but we're so open to influence
*  yes thank you for that uh euphemism so it's you know it's pretty it's pretty interesting
*  okay so we don't have a ton of time left we were going to talk about eeg and people these direct
*  to consumer eeg devices that are billed also somewhat in the same manner in a very similar
*  fashion we're just going to touch on it briefly one of the interesting things so you've written
*  about this as well and studied these eeg devices so eeg is widely used in labs for researching
*  cognitive processes among other things in humans and we did eeg and in monkeys as well and for lay
*  consumers it's it's being marketed for thought control like so you can think about you can
*  control drones for instance using your thoughts to control a drone and any things like that
*  and also for brain enhancement so you see what your eeg signature looks like and you can work
*  on it and i think it's called a muse is that the meditation device that's one yeah so you this
*  neurofeedback thing and you can make the your brain patterns change by viewing and observing
*  your own brain patterns one of the interesting things to me out of your study about the eeg is
*  that the overlap between eeg users and tdcs users is really minimal so only seven percent
*  of the tdcs users also use the eeg which is a crazy statistic to me you're very astute for picking up
*  on all these points yes um yeah i thought there would be more overlap because when you think
*  about i when i think about direct to consumer technology and users of direct consumer and
*  neuro technology you might think that someone who uses one kind of dtc neuro technology will
*  use another kind but yeah that's not necessarily the case yeah so anyway uh you know this this is
*  a podcast about the the interface between neuroscience and ai so i'm just going to throw
*  in there that there are machine learning techniques that are being used to analyze the eeg data
*  that are actually more accurate in in their predictions of your behaviors and cognitive
*  processes but the caveat is they're likely analyzing the data that's coming from your
*  eye movements because as you know as we know in the eeg world eye movements create this huge
*  artifact but they're also correlated with your facial expressions with how you're feeling and
*  stuff so they can actually be used to infer mental states and behaviors yes i'm just kind
*  of getting us flying us through the eeg world because there's there's more meat there and i'll
*  link that paper in the show notes as well so can i i just want to say a few more quick things just
*  about the eeg great i mean if you have time i'd that'd be great yeah yeah so i think the eeg was
*  in study was interesting in that we critiqued uh my co-author robert thibault and i critiqued an
*  area that really hadn't been or an industry um that hadn't really been critiqued before so there's
*  a lot of people talking about uh brain stimulation home use of brain stimulation and there's been a
*  lot of talk of brain training games whether they work and the ftc has gotten involved but i feel
*  like the direct-to-consumer eeg devices have sort of slid under the radar a bit um but they're out
*  there they're being marketed to consumers and again like you said with the idea that you can
*  read you know if you wear these things they're going to read out your emotion or mental state
*  and by having access to that data you can then improve your emotion or mental state or behavior
*  and what we did in the paper was not test individual devices which i think would be
*  a worthwhile endeavor but was to to say what are the claims these companies are making and what
*  would the assumptions what are the assumptions that would need to hold true if these claims
*  were to be correct and so we found that there's no good evidence that these consumer eeg devices
*  which are cheaper have fewer electrodes than the research or laboratory grade devices that you
*  mentioned right um there's no evidence that the data is valid or reliable right and there's also
*  no evidence generally speaking that having access to your brainwave data even if it were to be
*  correct can help you improve your mental state there's a bit of controversy around the neuro
*  feedback literature which claims that but there's also not there's not a lot of good studies
*  in that space so we kind of took aim at this industry and it may be doing something it may
*  not be but whatever it is there needs to be more there definitely needs to be more evidence and
*  published evidence i'd say in this space you know one interesting piece of evidence going back to
*  the tdcs study that you did users i believe it was in that one it might have been in the eeg but
*  users report using these products less frequently over time which implicitly shows that they're not
*  really affecting them in a way that they are noticing yeah i would love to do a study of
*  users of these direct-to-consumer eeg devices but in this case i published something that was not
*  so friendly first i'm sure they would not be into be into collaborating oh these companies must
*  love you yeah but the eeg stuff is interesting and i think you know given that this podcast about
*  ai and machine learning right so so what can you glean from the eeg data that's a really interesting
*  question in neuroethics and something i've been thinking about recently i'm writing a commentary
*  on another paper you can get some stuff and i think we're i think we're better than chance at
*  detecting certain features but i think there's a mistake what you're talking about with the diy
*  stuff that consumer product no i'm talking about with eeg yeah like consumer versions of the eeg
*  or lab studies i'd say lab lab versions of the eeg so i think from the ai or computational
*  perspective what people try to show is detecting certain responses to certain events like the are
*  you familiar i'm sure you're familiar with erp and the p300 yes yes so an erp is just this eeg data
*  that's time averaged over multiple trials and so you so you then you get to really see the time
*  signature of when uh the electrical component is um fluctuating in in the data whereas eeg data itself
*  is super noisy so it's the squiggles across the screen and on a trial by trial basis you can't
*  really make discern anything from it well there's work being done on that but the erp yes it's just
*  averaged over time which kind of filters out the noise right and so there's certain i'm sorry are
*  you familiar with the p300 yeah there are all these different names of components uh of that erps are
*  associated with with different cognitive processes um and you're trying my memory here but the p300
*  that is not the awareness component is it that's that's the aha wave the surprise the surprise or
*  recognition or the stimulus the reaction to this stimulus is different than the other stimulus
*  like this is the think of a number from one to ten in your head okay let's say i'm thinking number
*  five the p300 will look different supposedly when you know let's say you flash all the numbers across
*  the stream when the five when the five i see the recognition yes but there's a lot of other
*  studies with p300 too that i can't just conjure but there's so it's a well studied erp component
*  super well studied yeah but i'm just a brain scientist so i can't name them of course anyway
*  there's there's a um a lot of people talking now about the p3 so so the p300 is this inadvertent
*  sort of inadvertent response to certain stimuli right i mean it's inadvertent in the sense that
*  i can't control my p300 right so there's been quite a few studies from the computer
*  science world that have looked into whether you can hack someone's brain whether the p300
*  can reveal information that the subject might not have told you so the thing i want to just
*  point out is that in those studies better than chance is a good measure and those studies are
*  considered successful from the point of those researchers or or statistically better than chance
*  statistically better than chance right so let's say i held a digit from zero to nine in my head
*  you would have a one in ten one in ten chance of guessing that digit on the first try right so
*  you'd have a 10 chance of guessing that first try if there's an algorithm that shows that
*  using the p300 and showing me a bunch of stimuli on the screen and i'm holding again holding a
*  number in my head that shows that if the algorithm has a 20 chance of guessing correctly on the first
*  try then the algorithm is performing better than chance which is 10 percent okay so that's all to
*  say but but at the same time it's still 80 incorrect on the first try the point is that all this stuff
*  is exciting but i feel like a lot of your ethicists have misread and and i think some more hype than
*  has been warranted has been generated around studies that have performed have shown better than chance
*  um ability yeah you don't want if you're uh skydiving you don't want to only pull the
*  parachute slightly better than chance right for it to be really useful we need it to be reliable
*  right so so all that to say machine learning is really so i think machine learning and ai will
*  really come into play with eg although i don't know if eg will ever i don't know if eg is ever
*  going to get a good enough signal to to be totally reliable i think that we disagree on that you think
*  yeah but well because there's already single trial i mean given enough electrodes
*  and given enough elect i mean there's a lot of factors with the noise and the electrical
*  signal and the impedance and all of the stuff that we don't need to get into i think i'm more
*  optimistic about using all of the electrodes as data points um that you know single trial
*  activity could could be pretty accurate eventually but i don't know i could be convinced otherwise
*  do you think there would ever be an easy setup of an eg like home setup yeah that it would be
*  that because you fair if you can if you really have all the electrodes you're getting good contact
*  i see that i can go like possibly there but um i think that if you i mean this is just shooting
*  from the hip but i i think that if your eg cap also contained a shielding cap over it right where
*  you can shield the noise from the external world and somehow that that would improve things you
*  know but um i mean this was sort of my on my agenda to work on before i left left academia
*  really well i was just interested in it because i had done monkey neurophysiology so i was
*  interested in getting into the eg world and because that would also broaden my prospects for a job an
*  academic faculty position so and brain waves oscillations have been had been interesting to
*  me i'd read a lot about them and i just i didn't i didn't quite get there i was stuck
*  mired in neuro monkey neurophysiology recording their brain activity but you you have an infant
*  though you want to hear my entrepreneurial idea this is i had this right when i had an infant so
*  sure it's a baby eg cap so you you strap the thing on and you got to train it but its job is
*  to tell you oh baby's about to fall asleep for this long wouldn't that be awesome
*  could you could you do that i didn't i haven't tried it yet you know so uh but like predict the
*  the duration of a nap you might be able to based on like sleep spindles and some of the neural
*  signatures of as as your brain goes into deeper sleep and things like that i don't know or i can
*  you babies about to wake up you better come out of your euphoria you know yeah i think you could
*  do that i mean sleep and eg that's a very well characterized and useful mothers across the world
*  would would be purchased these days so you need to get the regulation going before i start selling
*  this is what i'm saying you could you could there's there's companies now selling home eg devices for
*  improving sleep so you could just yeah no regulation so if you say cure insomnia then
*  you're in trouble if you say improve the quality of sleep what about induce lucid dreaming because
*  i actually have a friend who's working on this so yeah he's really interested into lucid dreaming
*  and so yeah it's fine you do it i think that would be yeah there's one company that's out there that
*  markets i've seen like increased lucid dreaming or something like that yeah there's plenty of on
*  kickstarter and stuff yeah i mean is neurohacking here to stay are we is this just a fad or is this
*  something that's just going to continue um it's a good question i mean we've seen neurohacking more
*  broadly could mean you know trying to improve ourselves trying to optimize our performance
*  trying to optimize our cognition is do you mean this this broader thing i mean i mean the more
*  narrow let's let's stick with the eg and tdcs world i mean you know these kinds of technologies
*  it's going to get more and more invasive and eventually there's going to be brain chips or
*  is there going to be backlash and people are going to back off or you know or is it just an
*  inevitable progression here so i'm i'm a skeptic so i don't think at this stage that people will get
*  invasive that that the consumers are going to buy into invasive neuro technology so neuro
*  technology that requires surgery for enhancement purposes for recreational and enhancement
*  purposes there may be a subculture of people who do that hell there already is yeah well the sub
*  culture not in the brain not in the brain right biohacking you know grinder whatever they're
*  called um that world certainly but i think what we're going to see is that it probably remains a
*  subculture um it might that might be modulated by whether or not these technologies turn out to be
*  really effective or not and you know as i've seen in my studies it's not a technology that people
*  find to be overwhelmingly effective you know so i think that's going to hamper its spread
*  um and and you know when when this technology first came out there was a fear oh my god it's
*  going to be widespread everyone's going to be hacking their brains they're going to be it's
*  going to become widespread people are going to be forced to use it and that's really not what we've
*  seen so now we have some you know started in 2012 let's say so now we could look back and see that
*  it hasn't achieved widespread uptake there may be a new technology though that comes out that's
*  better that's more effective that has a direct to consumer version and it may be a different story
*  for that i don't think it'll be the case with tdcs at least not in the near future with eeg i
*  would say no way well yeah i totally i'm a skeptic yeah i'm a skeptic when it comes to eeg okay well
*  let me let me flip this around then because so we are as humans uh we are notoriously terrible at
*  predicting the future but i'd like you to predict the future so you know is there what what is
*  something can you name something that you believe will come true in the in the neuroscience brain
*  stimulation neurohacking ai that may seem far-fetched even though you're a skeptic is
*  there something you think oh i bet this is going to happen where where i see the most promising
*  research going is with machine learning for really good quality data and for more invasive so both
*  like mri fmri meg not so i'm not talking about consumer neuro technology i'm talking about
*  laboratory research grade high quality those so those are neuroimaging techniques that i mentioned
*  you could also think about ecog going just inside the brain i think that there's really amazing
*  potential there for machine learning in ai but those are really high quality signals right so
*  there's the study from jack galant is that his name his lab with i think it's gallant isn't it
*  might be gallant i'm not sure yeah probably gallant um i met him i don't know how to pronounce his
*  last name um but in reconstructing right those visual images from from scenes that have been
*  shown to uh i don't know where they there was a few studies like at least in one there was
*  they were showing youtube videos or something like that yeah i'm gonna i'm about to invite a
*  speaker i haven't emailed him yet but uh just on this very topic and so hopefully we can get into
*  it and how it all works so yeah but i think there's a lot of potential there so where i'm
*  skeptical is in the consumer versions and in i'm skeptical of of non-high fidelity recordings
*  or the fact that they'll ever make their way into the consumer realm so i'm skeptical of the idea
*  that will one day i'll be walking around with very accurate very portable lightweight monitoring
*  devices that are going to read everything that we say so you don't you're not prone to seeing the
*  box of cereal the fruity pebbles at the store and it says even fruitier that doesn't make you pick
*  it up no i i usually don't even get that kind of thing i know come on all right let's test it i
*  mean i think it'll be interesting and it'll be interesting to see what happens when there's a
*  lot of money thrown at a problem so facebook and neurolink throwing a lot of money at this you know
*  they're they're quiet about what they're working on but overall they're working on uh consumer
*  facing bcis yeah i assume that's eeg they're throwing a lot of money at it they don't have
*  the restrictions that academia has right so i think there'll be progress there but i'm skeptical
*  in the sense that this is a problem that people have been working on for decades now and there's
*  you know there may be hard limitations to gleaning you know lots of rich personal
*  information from from consumer eeg products well we will see maybe well maybe we'll see who knows
*  but you know what what's something that you wish was on your cv that's not yet that's a very good
*  question a book ah a book it's i know it's in the future because you write a lot maybe in the
*  future maybe not given that i'm on the academic track yeah last question here so what's something
*  that um you either don't have time or the resources to work on that but you wish someone else would be
*  working on if you could you'd be working on these are really good questions coming from someone who
*  used to interview people it's a very good question um does it have to be related to science no it
*  would be a charity or a non-profit that would help american kids who've graduated high school
*  it would um support them as they spent a year traveling around the world instead of going
*  straight to college that would be so cool that's a great answer i've always wanted to do that
*  she is anna wexler you can uh find more information about her at anna wexler.com thanks for talking
*  with me anna and thanks for going so long i really appreciate it yeah sorry it gives me more work in
*  edit i didn't hear about that the rv uh yeah but what's your what was what was the highlight of
*  the rv uh and how do you answer those two tough questions because those are really
*  tough questions that you put forward i don't have to answer them so
