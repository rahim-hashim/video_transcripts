# BI 128 Hakwan Lau: In Consciousness We Trust
**Brain Inspired:** [February 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGPvKyMcWi8)
*  My graduate advisor Dick Passingham was a great teacher and really trained, taught me everything I needed to know in neuroscience or maybe even in being a good person.
*  He's really a very influential figure and mentor to me. But one of the constant friction was he didn't really want me to go into this field.
*  And I kind of reluctantly get into theory and I just say I have an inclination, I hang out with philosophers, maybe too much, and I like thinking about this.
*  But every time I do it I do try to remind myself this is an indulgence and so I constantly try to force myself to do less theory and more careful experiments.
*  What percentage of empirical studies about consciousness do we need to just throw away?
*  I would think the majority of it, unfortunately.
*  That hurts.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  The science of consciousness is a notoriously tricky, slippery, hard endeavor to pursue, as is the philosophy of consciousness.
*  Many of us, including myself, I'm Paul, when we enter neuroscience we're quickly cured of our desire to pursue it scientifically.
*  But some folks boldly continue the empirical study of consciousness.
*  Ha Kuan Lao is one of those folks and he's just released his new book all about it, In Consciousness We Trust.
*  The book documents many of the challenges people like Ha Kuan face in making progress.
*  It also explains his own recent thinking and work to make progress.
*  And it's also part memoir documenting his own path thus far.
*  When Ha Kuan was on the podcast on episode 99 with Steve Fleming we talked a little bit about this.
*  But in this episode we dive deeper and discuss some of what's covered in his book.
*  So Ha Kuan is starting his new consciousness lab at the Riken Center for Brain Science in Japan where he recently took a new position.
*  And in the show notes I link to his book and how to find out more about him.
*  Those are at braininspired.co.uk
*  Also a quick note, I will very soon launch the next round of my Neuro AI course
*  which is a series of pretty condensed video lectures on many of the topics related to what we discuss on this podcast
*  and the intersection of neuroscience and AI plus some other bells and whistles.
*  So if you missed out on the last round or have interest in joining this new round
*  go to the website to check that out as well braininspired.co.
*  And in the menu you can click on the Neuro AI course tab.
*  Thanks for listening everyone. Special thanks as always to my wonderful Patreon supporters.
*  Happy scienceing out there. Hope you enjoy.
*  Ha Kuan, welcome back. I know that you are a musician and I'm curious how your musicianship has been going.
*  Have you been playing lately? What do you play and have you been playing lately?
*  I play all sorts of instruments very poorly. Since the pandemic I've been mostly playing drums actually.
*  I've been practicing those rudiments on the pad because it's somewhat meditative and it's not really music.
*  It's more like exercise to me.
*  Oh nice.
*  And I try to play piano now and then but also very poorly so it doesn't really count.
*  So I released this Neuro AI course that I've been working on for a long time
*  and I promised myself that when I did I would buy this electric guitar and a small amp.
*  I haven't had an electric guitar in a long time because we sold all of our stuff.
*  That's for a different story.
*  But I still haven't pulled it.
*  You know, I released the course and I still haven't pulled the trigger because I'm afraid I won't play with my toys, you know,
*  and that it won't be justified essentially.
*  So I'm glad to hear that you're playing.
*  That's very wise.
*  I think over the years, I think all guitarists in particular, they are very bad at buying new toys.
*  I was guilty of that, buying a lot of new toys and never using them for real.
*  Yeah, yeah, just, you know, I need the discipline.
*  Anyway, well, I'm glad to hear that you're playing.
*  So In Consciousness We Trust.
*  This book, well, first of all, can I ask you just to explain the title?
*  I was curious where the title came from.
*  Actually, it probably came from music.
*  I think a while ago when I was in the House of Blues, I saw in Blues We Trust and that slogan left a very strong impression.
*  And I think it's just a riff on that.
*  And it really has kind of two indirect meanings.
*  One is that one is the scientific content part.
*  The book, ultimately, one of the theoretical idea is that consciousness is the content from perception to cognition.
*  So it's basically that consciousness is the interface through which your perceptual content directly impinges on your cognition.
*  So whatever you're consciously experiencing, you tend to trust it.
*  It's very hard to ignore your conscious content.
*  So in that sense, it's the kind of the foundation of everything we believe and trust.
*  Oh, I see. So it's like wrapped up in the whole perceptual reality monitoring theory.
*  I hadn't put that together. That's interesting.
*  Sort of. Yeah, I didn't really explain it explicitly either in the book.
*  I just thought it's OK. People can configure it out.
*  And of course, there's a second kind of sense that it feels a bit like a manifesto, like a political agenda almost.
*  And I also like the ring of it.
*  And again, I never explained it directly how it's connected, but I just left it there.
*  Well, so reading the book, especially the first half, which goes through all of the thorny issues of empirically studying consciousness,
*  it gave me nightmarish flashbacks to when I was starting in graduate school,
*  thinking about how to apply scientific practice to study something like consciousness.
*  But you really go through so well here. Forgive the pun.
*  But consciousness is a confounding thing to study, right?
*  Because there are so many confounds to deal with, and you go through them in tremendous detail and sort of sets the stage for all of the different
*  empirical issues related to it.
*  So thanks for sending me back into cold sweats there, first of all.
*  Well, thanks for even reading it.
*  I thought that it would already scare a lot of people away just opening up the cans of worms.
*  Well, I'm curious if you had an intended audience in mind, because more so than many of the kind of popular science books that are written about consciousness,
*  this really does dive into a lot of the research and explains a lot of it.
*  So who did you have in mind when writing it?
*  Yeah, certainly. It was a very conscious decision, pardon the pun.
*  But it was definitely written as a monograph, as a book that is really written for people who already have some interests, or at least in academic research.
*  So we're thinking like graduate students to actual full-time, graduate students are full-time too, but other better paid, more better paid academics with more job security.
*  So it's really written for researchers.
*  And I've been obviously warned against it.
*  And people said, you know, why would you write such a book?
*  Nobody would read it.
*  You would not make any money out of it.
*  And that might have even made me realize that, yeah, then I definitely need to write this because there are so many good popular books around and they do such a great job already.
*  I'm not the kind of person who would write a better popular book than the existing ones.
*  But I feel there is maybe a room for a book that is aimed for maybe a more niche audience where people really want to get into the research, but find that the literature is kind of messy.
*  So this is a book trying to hopefully clean things up for some people.
*  In some sense, it reads like you are thinking through the ideas yourself in real time.
*  And I don't know if it's written while you were writing it, if you were conscious of your own trajectory, your own journey in studying these things.
*  But that's the way it reads.
*  Is that accurate?
*  Yeah, I think there's a small element of it being somewhat like a memoir.
*  It is something that I've done, as I said in the book, to basically maybe not so explicitly, but I basically it is something I've done my whole adult life.
*  So ever since I achieved not the consciousness in the sense of having subjective experience, but basically having adult level rationality, that's something that I've always been doing.
*  And this book kind of goes back to the very beginning.
*  And it doesn't reflect thinking on the fly because all these things I've thought through, I think, the past two decades.
*  And that's why I wrote it.
*  But I tried to basically recall the whole journey and especially in some places went into mistakes I've clearly made and think about the logical errors and struggles I've had.
*  Yeah. Well, you're very honest throughout the book in documenting your own rethinking of your positions as you've gone along.
*  So I enjoyed that as well because I think often when you read an account, someone doesn't take the self-reflective time and energy to, I don't know if confess is the right word, because that's the way science is supposed to work.
*  But I enjoyed that aspect of the book.
*  Thank you. Yeah.
*  I think that in part has to do with the memoir-like aspect of it.
*  I wanted it to be on record to remind myself how easy to make those mistakes, how tempting those mistakes were.
*  But also maybe that's part of the rhetorical intention, too, is to really try to say like these are not easy problems.
*  And I think we in particular about the positioning of the book is related.
*  So there are a lot of popular books out there.
*  They gave very slick and exciting stories.
*  And I think they're great.
*  I mean, they're important for bringing in new audience.
*  But I think for researchers within the field, we have to be honest that we have not thought through these issues.
*  Some of the very basic logical issues we have not thought through.
*  The other thing that I had realized through reading the book is it may have been like two months ago, but this has been on my mind how valuable it would be to have a sort of well, it was a project that I proposed to someone and we haven't moved forward on it.
*  But maybe now we don't need to to have like a repository of all of the research studies about consciousness, like with the paradigms, the tasks, the confounds and your book kind of encapsulates all of that.
*  So maybe I don't need to make that project that project anymore.
*  Maybe you should, because that's just my you know, my version of it.
*  But that's the at least that's the attempt.
*  And I in a way, I hope more people are doing this instead of going for the more exciting, cute ideas or maybe not cute, even profound ideas.
*  I think we have too many ideas and not enough people doing this organizational work and try to say like, OK, how do we even evaluate these ideas beyond saying that this idea sounds cooler than the other?
*  So I think that that's part of the goal.
*  Well, that harkens to, you know, a lot of people in neuroscience, not necessarily the study of consciousness, but talk about how we are bereft of theory, right?
*  We have all this data and we but what we're lacking is theory.
*  But are you saying that in consciousness, there are too many theories or or just ideas?
*  Definitely. I think both theories and ideas and we we we have too many of them.
*  I think to the extent that you think neuroscience has too many of them, we have a problem that is much bigger in magnitude.
*  And the ideas tend to be maybe also the nature of the ideas a bit worse.
*  The idea is often people put a lot of personal ascription and stick into the ideas like like this is my greatest idea before I before before I win my second Nobel Prize, I should really, you know, air out these ideas on something like that.
*  There's a kind of sense of personal indulgence involved.
*  And then the people who test those ideas also tend to have a kind of sense of almost like idolizing the people giving those ideas.
*  And I think that that's just not very healthy.
*  You've written about that as well elsewhere in other manuscripts as well.
*  Let me let me read. I'm going to read a couple of quotes from the book here.
*  Here's one toward the beginning of the book, which speaks to the complications.
*  So all current theories seem to make some rather improbable predictions.
*  Of course, if we know for sure that a theory is correct, we should accept whatever improbable consequences it entails.
*  But I hope that the attentive reader should have been convinced by now that the science of consciousness is just no such simple matter.
*  It's fairly depressing, you know, we're going to talk about the contents of the book and your ideas and your own research more.
*  But I kind of want to linger on this. The difficulty in studying something like consciousness.
*  Have you been like in your own little journey?
*  Like you said, your entire adult life has been working on this on these things empirically and thinking about them even, you know, and philosophically as well.
*  I know you interact with a lot of philosophers.
*  Given the complexities and the massive amounts of confounds that you have to think about, it seems well, for someone like me, it seems likely that I would grind to a halt and just wouldn't find space to continue.
*  Have you ever felt yourself grinding toward a halt and and or been so put off by all the complexities or the complications that you've thought of moving elsewhere?
*  Definitely. Very many times.
*  And or at least I thought of this, especially especially about quitting science.
*  So I might still want to think about consciousness and then I might want to write popular books or just indulge in a bit of unprofessional philosophizing about it or maybe even becoming a professional.
*  At some point, I thought, you know, I have a PhD is not in the discipline, but I published philosophy papers that are cited in philosophy.
*  I constantly think if I just leave science packet in how how how much would it take for me to retrain myself as a philosopher?
*  And I especially earlier on in my career, I constantly thought about that because doing science in this just seems to be not so realistic.
*  At some point, it's just it's not it's not like I don't enjoy the science.
*  At some point of the projection became like I thought I hated doing science.
*  And every time I was about to quit, I realized, no, actually, I really I would really miss doing it.
*  So it's not that I don't like doing science, but doing science in this field is is really endlessly frustrating.
*  You really feel you're not making much progress and you're just trying to put out fires sometimes.
*  And, yeah, that that is very yeah, that that actually is still on my mind.
*  Even my reason move from from from one job to another.
*  I thought about this again all over again.
*  But you have interacted with a lot of philosophers and you continue to obviously I know your friends with Richard Brown and you know, and you have open dialogues with NetBlock and on and on.
*  This is a terrible question, but I don't know.
*  Can you describe the difference in interacting with other empirical researchers versus interacting with the philosophy side of it?
*  Because I imagine that the philosophy side is also I don't know.
*  Is it I don't know if it's less frustrating, but maybe you can just answer the question, I suppose.
*  Yeah, I think they there's some frustration too, but they're different.
*  But but there's one thing I really like.
*  Maybe I say what I not like about interacting with philosophers over first because it's less important.
*  So I leave the punch line heavier later.
*  So the the part is that they with with a few exceptions like people like NetBlock or my co-author, Matthias Michel, many of them are not really that deep into the empirical literature.
*  So these are people, Nat and Matthias are people who sometimes would tell me about papers that I don't know.
*  So in the middle of a debate, they would they would they would pull out empirical evidence that I didn't know that existed.
*  And so that's really fun. But most of the time is not quite like that.
*  Right. So they the philosophers who have any time for me quite often do so to talk to me because because they think that I can I can share my knowledge in science.
*  And they so their level of knowledge is not as good.
*  And quite often the debates then becomes very purely conceptual, which is interesting, but it's not not always so effective in resolving differences.
*  So that's some well, mildly frustrating.
*  Yeah. Yeah. But the but the really good part I really like is in some way philosophy is more honest in the sense that you can at least it used to be more like that.
*  I think it's becoming a bit different. You can really go and attack your opponent's positions quite mercilessly.
*  And it would not be considered to be unfriendly or bad form, at least most of the time, unless you're really not polite about it.
*  But if you keep some minimal degree of civility, I think they are they genuinely appreciate back and forth of arguments because that that's how they do things.
*  And they realize the utility of it, which I also really I also appreciate.
*  But in science, of course, you can't really do that so freely.
*  If you take the same kind of combative attitude in science, you.
*  Well, I tried. You will suffer in your career because there will be retaliation and people do remember things and they they get upset and maybe understandably.
*  And, you know, when you really attack their work and in my effective funding effects, how they are the consequences, they they don't they don't accept the criticisms as as openly as philosophers do.
*  It seems like more than other fields in neuroscience, the science of consciousness.
*  And well, beyond science, what I was going to say is that consciousness, another difficult part of it is that you actually do need to know if you want to study it at all.
*  You do kind of need to know consciousness admits much more philosophy than other empirical neuroscience fields, I suppose.
*  So are you do you feel like you're constantly kind of going back and forth and having to think about the philosophical implications and and positions and where you stand on that and also the empirical side of things?
*  Yeah, definitely. I think that two sides of it, I think I because of my background, I my undergraduate training has a bit of philosophy.
*  And then I lived in New York City for for a few years where I interacted with a lot of the the major philosophers in active in the field.
*  So I tend to actually sometimes just go in and try to steal ideas and borrow ideas and then try to translate them into the language of science and even sometimes go about testing them.
*  So I benefit from that. But I think even at a more basic level, just thinking about these very, very basic issues about necessity and sufficiency, how do you define what is the theory and how how to avoid confounds.
*  These are things that we scientists supposedly know these are terms that we don't we don't think of them as philosophical terms.
*  But often we don't really think deep enough about them. In fact, I would say maybe maybe it's my maybe it's a problem in my field.
*  But I think in neuroscience in general, I think most people make mistakes about these these terms quite regularly.
*  And because most of the time doesn't matter if you if you if you do if you if you're in a more mature field, you know what experiments are good and experiments are bad.
*  Even sometimes you can't articulate it. So so clearly, you know that certain things are bad. You know that this won't get you published and then you stop.
*  Whereas in in consciousness is more of a kind of wild west situation, and there's so many things you can try and people are trying new things and and some of the existing ideas are turned out to be completely flawed.
*  But then the field is so small that the recognition of the problem hasn't happened hasn't been become so widespread yet.
*  So so you constantly have to apply these what I call almost like basic critical thinking sales.
*  And once you put it this way, people would say like, no, come on, we have this critical thinking. We don't need this.
*  And I think part of the book, at least early chapters to try to convince people.
*  No, we really do. And we in print make a lot of really embarrassing mistakes.
*  And if we don't go clean them up, we will be quite a lot of trouble.
*  It turns out this stuff is hard.
*  He's very hard and convincing people that they're in trouble is a thankless job.
*  And and that's maybe that's why I want to write it as an academic monograph, because I don't think the book would make any money anyway.
*  If I if I try to make it popular and more more aim for a general audience.
*  Basically, I'm a downer is not is not going to sell very well.
*  Yeah, well, that's why I alluded to my cold sweats that you induced in me.
*  All right. So I'm going to here I'm going to read another little passage.
*  And this is from the last chapter, Chapter nine.
*  And so you write, when I was young, I thought I would one day write a book to solve the hard problem.
*  I still have not given up on the problem itself.
*  But by now, I recognize that it was a diluted idea.
*  At the moment, the best I can offer is summarized in this final chapter, an extended version of perceptual reality monitoring, which includes some elements of quality space theory.
*  So we'll talk about two of both of those things during the course of the conversation.
*  But I'm keying on the when I was young, I thought I would one day write a book to solve the hard problem.
*  Do you have thinking about your own mistakes and your own trajectory and thinking about consciousness and working on it, all the empirical work that you've done that you've done?
*  Do you have advice to someone who is thinking that they will one day write a book that solves the hard problem, et cetera?
*  Someone who's like starting off in their career thinking of your own?
*  Yeah, I think I think at least I can maybe not sure the advice will be much useful, but at least I can share one element that I totally misjudged and I didn't think it would be so hard.
*  So when I started out, my graduate advisor, Dick Passingham, was a great teacher and really trained, taught me everything I needed to know.
*  And in neuroscience, or maybe even in being a good person, he's really a very, very influential figure and mentor to me.
*  And but one of the constant friction was he didn't really want me to go into this field.
*  He thought that basically, I think most of the first couple of years of working with him, a lot of our conversation goes back to this issue.
*  He would basically try to convince me, why don't you work on something that is more promising?
*  Because this really feels like it will be wasting your time.
*  And yeah, he will be trying to talk me into a number of different arguments, like sometime about how tractable something would be.
*  And in the end, I sort of won that debate in terms of convincing myself.
*  I never convinced him that he should be doing that.
*  But I think I soldiered on.
*  We're still looking back.
*  I'm still in it.
*  Yeah. So maybe in a sense, I won.
*  But I think one thing I wish I listened more carefully or I wish I realized was the hardest part is not just the science.
*  The science is hard enough, certainly.
*  And the philosophy is hard enough.
*  But another part is just social.
*  You're in science.
*  You have to you're basically constrained by the peer culture, by the peer group culture.
*  I mean, ultimately getting funding, getting published or even just like getting feedback from your peer group depends on what the peer group thinks.
*  And I think that, yeah, basically is a bit of a complaint or one of my downer moments.
*  I think that the culture of the field needs to change a little bit if we need to really move towards a solution to the problem.
*  Do you think that this is particular to the study of consciousness or do you because everyone faces constant a constant barrage, constant friction, right?
*  Do you think it's just accentuated?
*  Yeah, I think I think it's the kind of it's not a categorically new problem.
*  I think the problems exist in some other fields, too.
*  But I think having having moved around different fields a little bit, even though I never left consciousness, but in order to attack the problem, I would go to different disciplines.
*  Now and then I at some point I would I was just doing vision psychophysics for a few years.
*  And then I my wife is a sociologist, so I also interact with her colleagues and look into how they think about consciousness.
*  And I at some point I do human neuroscience.
*  I sometimes collaborate with people who work with animal models and and I try to devil a bit in computational modeling, having looked into how different fields work.
*  I think our field has some really uniquely problematic aspects and and and the explanation or those stories clear how historically we got to this place.
*  So basically, there is a there's a historical story how we got to this place where the emphasis of the few often play so much emphasis on stardom and the end of popularizing work, which otherwise is really important.
*  I think that the the the power and influence we we allow those populist ideas to together is really out of proportion.
*  And and and the other problem is because of the problems of the few being so bad that we have basically gathered together a group of people with a culture that we don't want to talk about those problems.
*  We have a bunch of people who are so good at soldiering on when other people told us that what we do is hopeless.
*  And so we have a culture of people who are kind of resistant to criticisms and some of them basically just ignore criticism and let it roll off the shoulders and say, OK, you guys been saying this for a long time.
*  I I'll do whatever I do anyway. And and I think cultures like that are not really helpful to us.
*  Was when when Dick passing him was, I guess, trying to help you out by warning you against it was was that sociological or was it the science part that he was warning against?
*  I think mostly the science part. I wish he warned me more about the sociological part.
*  But but at that age, I wouldn't have understood anyway.
*  I or cared. Yeah. Yeah. I thought, like, why do I care about my peers?
*  I just do my science. If they are wrong, I would just be right.
*  But no, you I think I come to learn you are you're really ever only as good as your peers and because it's a group activity.
*  So so the last few years I've been trying to maybe try to try to change that culture a bit without without much success, frankly.
*  But but I think it needs to be done. Yeah.
*  Well, that's how you actually finish the book talking about the sociology of all this as well.
*  And yeah. All right. Well, enough of the culture here.
*  And maybe we'll get back to it in a little bit.
*  So, like I said, the first half of the book, you you devote to explaining all of the intricacies and difficulties in empirically studying consciousness.
*  Well, one of the things that you do is you kind of lump a lot of well, in some sense, you lump everything into local versus global views of consciousness.
*  And I know that's not necessarily a fair distinction in your own perceptual reality monitoring.
*  You're trying to kind of go between the two as well.
*  But can you explain the difference between local and global views?
*  And then we'll get into perceptual reality monitoring.
*  Yeah. So these are somewhat caricatures or, you know, go post.
*  They're they're not a fair, detailed description of the entire lay of the land.
*  But I made an analogy that sometimes you to get the lay of the land, you would you just want to learn a few landmarks and some some very coarse grained orientation.
*  So global theories, as the name suggests, was suggested, consciousness informs involve some kind of informational broadcast throughout the many areas of the brain.
*  So if you're conscious in the sense of having a very simple subjective experience of just seeing a color patch that is red, just seeing that redness involves way more than your your visual neurons that are selectively tuned to to to redness in the in the early visual area.
*  It involves pretty much the whole brain, many areas frontal parietal, those higher association cortex areas.
*  And then local theories basically says the opposite.
*  They said if you see red, those neurons turn to red is is why you see red.
*  And those higher cortical areas in prefrontal parietal areas, those are just for the further thinking about that experience or the reporting of that experience or maybe even attention to those to that experience.
*  But it's not the experience itself. So that's the major distinction.
*  I think that has been very useful to to focus on because people do fall basically at least along the spectrum somewhere.
*  And so we talked about perceptual reality monitoring last time that you're on when you're on with Steve Fleming.
*  But to spare people to have to go search for that and listen to it.
*  Could you just kind of recap what perceptual reality monitoring is and how it fits into the local and global views?
*  Yeah. So basically, perceptual reality monitoring theory is a variant of another class of theory, sometimes go higher order theories.
*  And the idea basically is that the local guys are not wrong.
*  There is a sense that the when you see red, the early visual activity that directly selectively tune to to these content, they represent what is called the first order content.
*  So you need redness to see red.
*  But this is not sufficient. And on top of that, presumably you need some higher order activity and PRM perceptual reality monitoring is just kind of like an empirical story or neuroscience story trying to explain why that philosophical notion
*  that you need something higher order. Why is it plausible?
*  And the idea is, well, when your early visual areas, when the neurons coding tune to red, when they fire, there are a number of possibilities that that they fire.
*  It could be because you're actually seeing red. It could be because you're just imagining red.
*  So we know the top down imagery also activate some very similar activity.
*  And it could be that those neurons just fire spontaneously because noises everywhere in the brain.
*  And so because of these differences, then it would it is very plausible that there are some downstream areas that try to read out or monitor the early century activity representing red and try to make the inference and say what it really reflects.
*  Right. So if you say like with these neurons, these red two neurons are firing at 50 hertz, the higher order monitoring mechanism might decide, well, this is just baseline noise because baseline noise is about this level.
*  So let's just ignore it. Then you would have no conscious experience. You shouldn't have any conscious experience anyway.
*  And when it makes a mistake, so if it actually noise, but if you think that, oh, this is actually higher than baseline noise level, maybe it did the statistics wrong, then then you will be hallucinating.
*  So that basically is a way to say, well, you need this kind of late stage self monitoring engine.
*  And when that engine makes a mistake, it accounts for why you would have hallucination, why you would dream, why you sometimes see things normally and why you sometimes don't see things when you should and etc.
*  So so that helps to argue why why the the prefrontal and parietal mechanism are important.
*  But the first order is also important.
*  And you've in your earlier manuscript, you have tied this together with the notion of generative adversarial networks and how a similar mechanism works with with GANs as well.
*  Yeah, so so part of the at least one one criticism, the philosophical theory of higher order theory has been have to face and some actually some authors because of some philosophers because of the argument actually left the higher order cam was that they think that it's not plausible that the brain would grow this higher order organ.
*  So you have a first order signal that that says red, why don't you just tack it there or use them dynamics to just distinguish the cases?
*  Why would you grow another thing on top to try to monitor it sounds so clumsy and so so much like a homunculus and so some people think that it's just empirically not plausible.
*  And so using the GANs argument is to say, well, actually, if you look at just an artificial neural network, where people just try to solve engineering problems, they end up doing something very similar to what we're doing.
*  So it may not be so implausible that evolution equipped us with this kind of higher order monitor.
*  So in the context of of GANs, the idea is that way to train a top down generative model going from the concept of a cat to the actual first order representation of a cat, an image like representation of a cat to do this kind of top down self-generated self-generated imagery would be very useful.
*  We know that you can allow you to do predictive coding and all sorts of nice stuff.
*  And the problem about this is training those networks takes a lot of time.
*  And turns out there's a trick called GANs, generative adversarial network.
*  I think it's been called one of the coolest tricks in machine learning in the in the past decade by Ian Lacoon, I think.
*  And the trick is basically to set up one network that would do this, that would try to do this generative predictive coding and another network that was basically to try to compete with the generator.
*  And they call it the discriminator.
*  You basically look at a generated output and try to tell whether it actually is just generated or whether it's actually a real image of the world.
*  So you basically try to do forgery detection, they call it.
*  So you take you take an image and they say, well, this is generated by the generator or is it actually a sample from the world?
*  And then the two can then compete because if the discriminator catches the generator making a forgery, if it doesn't look enough like a real world sample, then they would try to punish the generator.
*  If the generator managed to slip in a forgery passing the detection of the discriminator, that is, you generated something that looked enough like an external real stimuli enough, then the discriminator would lose a point.
*  When you set them up to compete, then they both would grow very quickly.
*  So it's just for solving an engineering problem.
*  But you see that the discriminator is a bit like the high order monitor that I talk about.
*  You essentially look at your own sensory activities and say, well, this is generated by myself or it is generated or is triggered by the external world.
*  Please correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm still trying to wrap my head around kind of where you situate subjective experience.
*  Because I think most theories or most approaches to thinking about consciousness kind of hit it at this highest level of being.
*  That it's like at the end of the processing stream, wherever that, whether that's a local processing stream or a global thing, it's kind of like the end all.
*  And then there's consciousness. But yours seems that the PRM version, the discriminator reality monitoring type version, seems kind of in the middle of cognition.
*  Because then you have these lower order cognitive sensory modalities, things like that processing that then the reality monitoring system monitors that.
*  And then, am I right, passes it along to do some other higher order cognition that is not part of subjective awareness.
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right. It's a great question. I think that's the problem or the fundamental tension between the two camps.
*  The localist, the first order guys said, well, we're just talking about seeing red.
*  So, of course, we should look at the visual cortex and look for those neurons that clearly tune to red.
*  All these later on cognition is just cognition. What does it have to do with seeing red?
*  And then the higher order guys does sometimes come across as if we're over intellectualizing consciousness.
*  We sometimes come close to because of the jargons in philosophy, we come close to almost saying we're seeing red is a thought.
*  And it's about really high order cognition. You have to have sense of self and you have to be self aware to do all of this.
*  And then the local guy just said, well, you just talk about something else.
*  I'm not talking about that kind of consciousness like what the social scientists would talk about, like, you know, false consciousness, collective consciousness.
*  I'm not talking about the kind of highly intellectual self narrative about things. I'm not talking about your rationality.
*  I'm just talking about the simple feeling of seeing red. So obviously, you guys are just talking about something else.
*  And so I think my game plan has been to try to convince the local guys that, well, even when we just really talk about simple experiences,
*  sometimes not even things that you're attending to, not even things that you conceptualize and think about.
*  I think there's already a case to be made that there is some higher order impact like the GANs, like self monitoring.
*  You need to just sort out whether you're actually hallucinating red or seeing red or your red neurons are just firing randomly because of noise.
*  You need some sort of implicit self monitoring. And I emphasize that it's really implicit.
*  It happens automatically. It's not something you have to think about.
*  And presumably, very young children and small animals would have the same mechanism, even though they may not even know explicitly what a self is.
*  It's just that it's like the GANs. It works automatically. It's not something you have to activate and spend cognitive effort to do.
*  And then they would say, well, yeah, OK, so if that's true, then how does it relates to all the other really high order stuff that the sociologists and people talk about?
*  Then I think, well, then it's probably because you have these GANs like decisions to decide whether your first order input decide what they reflect,
*  because then that outputs to the higher really high order stuff, the self narrative and et cetera.
*  So your self narrative and the higher order cognition takes an input from the from the implicit higher order monitoring.
*  So exactly. So consciousness is exactly the interface between the between the early early century perceptual stuff to the really high order cognitive stuff.
*  But you know, so the brain is highly, highly, highly, highly recurrent, right?
*  So those higher order areas where we do sense of narrative and sense of self, can those reverse and become inputs into the reality monitoring interface as well so that they are like first order systems in that respect?
*  Yeah, that's a great question. I think they do.
*  But the but to the extent that that reverse input happens, it is probably more military.
*  So it provides some context in my impact is a little bit, but the impact is not so strong.
*  And I think it's not really constitutive to having experience.
*  And so when when you change your culture, when you just move to a different country and speak a different language and immerse it for decades, presumably changes your whole brain to some extent.
*  I think just like drinking wine, people talk about if you become a really wine buff or Knows here, which I'm not.
*  Scotch, right? Right. Scotch, actually.
*  Yeah, Scotch is a good idea. I used to not like Scotch and now I like Scotch.
*  So probably changes some of my very early kind of olfactory and taste processing to some extent.
*  But but that's kind of like an indirect route. It's not like that as soon as you think of Scotch and everything changes at that level.
*  One of the reasons why I'm asking about this and you write about the functions, the potential functions of consciousness in the book.
*  And so positing it like situating the our subjective experience sort of in between gives the worry that maybe we our consciousness doesn't have as much functional relevance as we would like it to have.
*  Right. It's a little scary. Right. So so first of all, just to understand consciousness, is it important to understand what function it may subserve or can we can we learn about consciousness without understanding its functions without an account of its functions?
*  Yeah, I think I think yes, but it's also not so straightforward.
*  I think the yeah, in general, like all the constructs in psychology and cognitive science, maybe even neuroscience, most of the the target phenomena are defined functionally.
*  So we say like we want to study memory. Nobody was steady a kind of memory that doesn't remember things.
*  So memories are the way they are because they store information for future retrieval and use, etc.
*  So so attention people sometimes say is vague. But as a functional concept, we also know it try to filter out some useless stuff or irrelevant stuff for the current purpose and try to boost the signals and gate them for downstream processing.
*  We can we can talk about a function like this is probably good to have. And then we can go and map out how to bring my implement a function when it comes to consciousness is trickier because there's a lot of kind of hand wavy saying about our consciousness.
*  Must have evolved to do X and Y. And and and it's really not a lot of empirical evidence that it does.
*  And if you think about how to even get empirical evidence for that, then it kind of goes into this kind of chicken and egg problem that if you define consciousness as self reflection, well, then yeah, then you will find a self reflection stuff to be the correlate.
*  But then the your opponents are going to say, well, but why do we define consciousness as self reflection?
*  It may not. It may not have those functions. And so it's a pretty tricky problem.
*  And I so I tend to side with the local theorists there in that they basically assume that consciousness has very little function, right?
*  At least in terms of higher cognition. So they would say basically, even in the more extreme version that that some people actually hold,
*  but maybe not a lot. But they would say if you cut out your visual cortex and put it on a pastry dish and keep it alive, it would have, you know, red qualitative experience, even though there's no downstream cognitive circuits to appreciate it.
*  Some people do think so. So basically that would have no function. And and some people think so long as it has the right network properties, even though is is completely detached to input output is not even functioning.
*  It would have it would have read experience, even if it doesn't do anything.
*  I think that's sounds extreme, but I think it's a good starting point, as in we should define a minimal notion of what what what red experience is maybe not as extreme as the pastry dish guys, the penpsychus.
*  But we can at least say, well, red experience is just being able to potentially report about red experience if you if you're able to report.
*  Right. So assuming that you can report about stuff, then then having red experience is to have the propensity to be able to report it.
*  And that's it. Maybe maybe that's a kind of more minimal definition.
*  Or maybe you can add a bit more. Right. You can see, well, being able to see red is to be able to see it as not blue.
*  Right. So that that also seems to make sense. And be able to see red maybe is also like you can see it as more like orange than blue.
*  That also seems almost like a given if it if it doesn't have these functional properties. I don't think it's it's the same phenomena anymore.
*  But should we assume that being able to see red is to be able to associate it with danger and to be able to slam on your brake when you see it on the on the traffic light?
*  I think those I would try to not assume that is the case.
*  And then and then having this minimal definition, the map out the circuit, then we can actually then empirically investigate what are the what are the normal functional advantages associated with that more minimal circuit.
*  This gets into the idea of mental quality space. Right.
*  So I guess my opening question would be if seeing red was the only experience, this is an impossible thought experiment, but it was it was the only experience one could have.
*  Then I guess you would posit that one is not having a conscious the first time you see red and you've had no other no other experience.
*  You actually don't consciously perceive red that you have to see red and then a little something different from red.
*  Yeah, I think for humans, I'm not sure.
*  But I think for for let's say for a creature that is that has evolved without any history of seeing any other color, then I think it would not see red as red.
*  It would just see a flash of light.
*  Yeah, it doesn't have that dimension. Right.
*  So I think that dimension comes about because we have maybe also in our evolutionary history, we have equipped our sensory cortex to to be able to distinguish these different things.
*  Then seeing red is about seeing it as not something else.
*  Seeing red is seeing it as it as it is redder than everything else.
*  So in relative terms, it has a distinct quality.
*  And I do think that that is part of the almost like the the basic function of the minimal function of definition that you should have.
*  Otherwise, otherwise, the theory runs to risk of basically being a theory of reportability.
*  It doesn't explain the qualitative aspects.
*  Well, so can you explain a little bit or describe a little bit what mental quality space is and and then talk about how you've incorporated it within the perceptual reality monitoring account?
*  Because this is something you kind of thought about more recently than the PRM idea itself.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's an example of where I totally went into philosophy and and and borrowed something from from from philosophers.
*  So the yeah. And and then try to match it with the science.
*  So the PRM story, despite its controversy and all that, I think I think we have a pretty good it has gained some scientific traction.
*  So it has made some impact in the field.
*  And I think I can I can give talks and list out the empirical evidence in favor of it.
*  It's not it's not a done deal as in science.
*  Many of these things won't ever be so so soon.
*  But at least I think there's enough scientific support.
*  I can say that it's a scientifically tested and partially supported theory.
*  But the problem is then it doesn't address this issue of why red looks the way it does.
*  It tells you, OK, if you have a if you have some red tuned activity in the brain, then you know when it will be conscious and when you'll be hallucinating it, you know when you cannot report it.
*  That's great. But it doesn't seem to get at the deeper issue about how why red have this qualitative aspect, why why it looks different from the other colors.
*  So it turns out mental quality space is an is a concept that can be traced back to at least at least Wilfred Sellers.
*  And then in more recent times, Austin Clark and David Rosenthal also wrote a lot about it.
*  So the idea and sometimes some other people call it a structuralist view of perception, which is to say the perceptual content has to be understood in relation to the all the other perceptual content that you can have.
*  So red looks the way it does because well, because it is more similar to orange and purple and pink and brown, more similar to these than to black and white and silver and blue and stuff.
*  So because of the if you if you want to express what it is like to see red, you can basically find out all the pairwise comparisons to all the other maybe not just color, all the other possible sensations you can ever have and write down all exhaustively how how each pairwise similarity is.
*  Then then you would basically describe what red is like. There's nothing more to be known.
*  And I find it quite plausible and strangely, my my strongest critics in the local is the first order camps also seem to think that there's some traction there.
*  So I so I like the idea. I think conceptually it works. But then the problem is, but it's so philosophical, right? So how do I combine that with PRM? That that was the what I did in the in the book in the final chapter.
*  So the idea is so PRM, as I mentioned earlier, is about your sort of high orders implicit self monitor, maybe like the discriminator in a Gantz like architecture.
*  It basically tried to look at or try to monitor the all of this is mechanistically done.
*  It just basically tried to look at the early sensory activity and make a decision as to say, well, this activity has these dynamic properties that given my statistical understanding, it is reflecting the state of the world right now.
*  So you better be conscious of that. So that's the decision. And if you think about that, then the the high order monitor has to have some sort of address book.
*  It has to know what these neurons and those neurons are in the early sensory cortex. Right.
*  And interestingly, the at least the early sensory cortex we look at is so often we forgot how how unique it is.
*  It's a very it has some nice properties there are that are not necessarily there in artificial perceptual mechanics.
*  So the neurons are very sparse. So at the same time, if let's say you're seeing red, only few neurons are a small number of neurons are involved in that.
*  Not your your entire sensorium has other neurons like in a touch and tactile and auditory cortices.
*  They are not involved or even within the color sensitive neuron. Not every neurons involved.
*  So so so as this part sparse coding property that is not not not really so trivial.
*  And it also is why it's smooth, right.
*  The representation, as we call it, a neural network, is it falls into a continuum.
*  So that means that for two sensory experiences, you can almost like trace down to address.
*  You can say, well, this experience is basically mostly driven by these neurons.
*  And then the other experience is mostly driven by those neurons.
*  And you can talk about these two addresses. They are like a population profile.
*  And then you can talk about how these two addresses are how much they overlap because it's a smooth continuum.
*  So for any two experiences, some meaningful degree to which they are similar and some degree they're not similar.
*  Basically, they overlap a lot. There's a lot of crosstalk.
*  Then then then you might actually confuse them.
*  So that means that the higher order monitor, to the extent that it can do its higher order job by, you know,
*  pointing at these early sensory coalitions and say, well, this is reflecting the world.
*  This is not. This is hallucination, et cetera.
*  Then it must know this address layout, right.
*  In some way, no, in an implicit sense.
*  I mean, the the the computations at the higher order level has to somehow be respecting and tracking the whole address.
*  The whole sensory layout of the sensory cortex.
*  Well, is it is the whole address or is it the differences?
*  Yeah, I would say it actually holds to address almost.
*  So if you again, I use these kind of natural language analogy.
*  Sometimes it get read the wrong. I don't really mean there's a little man sitting in the prefrontal cortex doing this.
*  But it's as if as if you if you tell the prefrontal cortex that, you know, this experience is coded by these neurons, even number them like these.
*  They're coded by neurons 57 to 78 with some, you know, fuzzy edges and et cetera.
*  And you can tell them then that then the prefrontal cortex should know. OK, those are color neurons.
*  I know that. And those color neurons are very far from another experience, which is coded by neurons.
*  One hundred twenty two to one hundred thirty eight, because these two populations are physically wired in a way that they are.
*  They are quite far apart.
*  So in a sense that your prefrontal cortex kind of knows what an experience is like, almost like you get it for free.
*  You is the analogy I use in the book is like like a dictionary.
*  If I tell you that a word is on page five of the OED, you basically can guess a bit what that word is.
*  And if I tell you, well, how how similar is that word to another word which is on page five hundred and five in a dictionary?
*  You know, they will be very different. The first few letters will be probably different.
*  And so likewise, if you know the layout of the address, which the prefrontal cortex, I argue it has to,
*  because otherwise how can it send all these top down signals to do attention, cognitive control?
*  It has to have some internal, maybe implicit grasp of the whole address system.
*  Then then in a sense, you that that's maybe how you get the mental quality space kind of for free.
*  And I say for free is not really free.
*  I mean, evolution probably equipped us to do this because there are advantages to sparsity and smoothness and this kind of architecture.
*  I have a few more questions that are just kind of popping into my mind because I think I thought about this reading your book.
*  And I don't remember if you address its relation to the cognitive map.
*  So right. So, you know, navigation has been really hot in the past few years in neuroscience.
*  And that then has extended. And the fact we the idea is that we have this cognitive map and how does it get encoded?
*  But then multiple studies have extended the idea of the cognitive map to abstract spaces as well.
*  And I don't know if you've thought about how this address kind of approach relates to cognitive maps.
*  Yeah, great question. It's not in the book, but it's in a paper coming out.
*  And the and the story is nice. So is one of those online meetings during the during the pandemic where I presented this mental quality space ideas.
*  So actually, I got into mental quality space right at the beginning of the pandemic when when there was nothing else to do.
*  And I just sat on my balcony. That's like a primacy effect. Right.
*  You remember the beginning of the pandemic and what you were doing.
*  Yeah, basically, this whole is a pandemic child, this whole MQS idea.
*  And and part of the problem is now, OK, having gone through a semi empirical story,
*  having constructed this semi empirical story and has to do with sparse and and smooth coding and Gantz, then how do we test this idea further?
*  I mean, it sounds like it's still kind of almost like a philosophical story.
*  It has some empirical assumptions. But how do we test it?
*  We are not going to be able to change the cortex to make it less sparse.
*  I suppose it will be kind of tricky to do.
*  But then my friend and Steve Fleming pointed out, well, maybe we can actually hypothesize that the higher order,
*  the higher the side when I say the addresses has to be incorporated somehow.
*  I was being very vague about this and thinking about the implementation is not easy.
*  And I was hoping some other clever computational modeling people would sort it out.
*  But then Steve said, well, but there is an idea which is exactly like this explicit or sort of explicit grid grid code that is used for spatial navigation in the brain.
*  And we know that how when we actually physically spatially navigate physical space during locomotion,
*  we know that in rodent and in humans, there are there are grid cells that that that encode the space and we allow us to do this navigation.
*  And we know that they have been used for abstract stuff like you pointed out.
*  In fact, there is one study that I think is the first was a bowel.
*  And I think they actually found that in auditory sense, sorry, in olfactory sensory space,
*  if you make people navigate over an olfactory space that is a space defined by the intensity of different odors.
*  So it's not an actual physical space, but it's just an abstract space defined by by different auditory olfactory stimuli.
*  By navigating through that, it seems to activate some grid like representations in the prefrontal cortex, too.
*  So then Steve thought, well, why don't we just go and test it?
*  So we wrote a paper and maybe we'll be doing that.
*  I didn't put it. I didn't try to update the book because the book at that point was already written.
*  And I also think it is probably a very long shot.
*  And so that's one possible way the prefrontal cortex handle these address,
*  which is to put these different sensory addresses onto a space, an abstract space,
*  and actually then try to use other other machinery or mechanisms for spatial navigation to actually try to navigate around that space.
*  It would be wonderful if the brain actually does that.
*  And if it does that, when whenever a conscious experience occurs, right, it's not just that in some train task, the brain can be trained to do something like that.
*  I think, yeah, I can be trained to think about color in terms of a 2D space.
*  But but when I just see color, I'm not sure my brain already instantiate this kind of space or this kind of spatial navigation activities.
*  But it's a it's a nice hypothesis that we can test. So we're doing that now.
*  Cool. So I don't know if this is even a well, we'll see if it's even a question worth asking.
*  But just you know, I'm continuing to try to flesh out kind of the situation where, you know, subjective experience is situated.
*  So for PRM, it really does not depend on any model of the world.
*  Right. So it doesn't need to connect to something like Bayesian brain where we are constantly having to try to model the world.
*  It's more it's really more like a gating discriminator mechanism.
*  So does it depend on a model or relate to models?
*  I would say it is it has a model of your sensory activity.
*  It has the statistics of your sensory activity.
*  But it's not it's not explicitly a model of the world.
*  I think the the the model of the world is probably downstream.
*  So not in the conscious realm or consciousness will feed into that model of the world.
*  And the model of the world might feed back to this mechanism to some lesser extent.
*  But the constitutive mechanism for having the simplest conscious experience requires having a model of your own sensory activity rather than it doesn't require a model of the world.
*  I would think of the world. Right.
*  So your science career, my science career, also my academic career was devoted to visual neuroscience, essentially.
*  Although I tried to I tried to study metacognition, but in a visual paradigm.
*  Right. And the vast majority of consciousness talk is about visual and seeing red is the paradigmatic example.
*  Are there is it useful to think about other sensory modalities?
*  I know you just mentioned olfaction and the kind of cognitive map that that can take place in our olfactory senses.
*  But is there in testing theories of consciousness, is it you is it a useful approach to try to triangulate among the different sense modalities?
*  Because, you know, vision is laid out topographically.
*  Right. And you were just talking about how olfactory has this kind of topographical smoothness as well.
*  But it seems if a robust theory of consciousness should be able to account for all the senses.
*  Right. Yeah, definitely.
*  And that's one of the limitations of current research that that we are we should be we should be very mindful of this limitation.
*  Much of it is done in vision.
*  There's a smaller degree that is done in auditory and tactile and olfaction is really tiny.
*  I see it as a it's a problem and should be addressed.
*  And hopefully the theory would generalize to the other cases.
*  And I sometimes think that that hope is, you know, is hopeful wishful thinking.
*  But at the same time, it's also the norm in science where we start with a paradigmatic case and hope that it generalize until it doesn't.
*  That is how science is done usually, basically.
*  So and the and the excuse for doing that, although all the reason for doing that is because mostly just is experimental convenience.
*  So we know that the visual system is well understood and it's easy to control the stimulus and you can stimulate the entire visual field pretty easily.
*  So doing tactile is a lot harder.
*  You are stimulating a much smaller portion of the of the whole of the whole tactile cortex because of the way that is spatially organized.
*  So you're just stimulating a small part of it.
*  So your signal, if you do whole brain imaging, it's going to be small.
*  And and when it comes to affection, the sensory fatigue is very it kicks in very easily.
*  Getting people to smell like 50 different stimuli, they usually want to they want to they want to get out.
*  Whereas making them to click on a few thousand Gabor patches, surprisingly, people are pretty good at doing that.
*  So so mostly these kind of convenient reasons we started with vision.
*  But eventually, yeah, we do have to test whether it generalize to all of them.
*  You've worked on a lot of different experimental modalities, right?
*  So you've used largely FMRI, but you've also stimulated with transcranial magnetic stimulation.
*  Where is our limit? I know we have multiple limitations, but, you know, can you imagine is technology holding us back?
*  If we had better recording devices or some technological breakthrough, would that actually help?
*  Or do we have the necessary tools now?
*  We just need to ask better questions and have better theories to test.
*  I think the technology would certainly help a lot.
*  It will be game changing. But I also think that the people who are very keen on pushing those boundaries, good for them.
*  But I think they often also neglect the simpler problems like confounds.
*  With a better scanner, you still have the same confound.
*  So if your concepts aren't right, it would still be problematic.
*  So I so in a way, I'm maybe I mean, I feel I'm in a good place.
*  I think the field is moving. There are new technologies. I can get my hands on them.
*  But I'm also not like frustrated for more frustrated by not getting to those new tools sooner, because even at the current technology,
*  there are still a lot of conceptual cleaning up that needs to be done.
*  You know, I kind of gleaned over the what is a massive part of the book in talking about all the different important issues related to the and thorny issues related to the studying consciousness empirically.
*  So I'd like to ask you just about a couple of those and then can leave readers to discover the rest of them in the book.
*  One of the things that you argue for is that task performance capacity is a crucial issue.
*  So could you just describe what you mean by that and why it's important?
*  Yeah, so it's one of those confounds that are maybe not so obvious.
*  And some people deny that is even a confound.
*  So the idea is that if you want to study consciousness in the sense of subjective experience, then you really want to find experimental manipulation so that you just change subjective experience, but nothing else.
*  Right. You want everything else as much as possible to be held constant.
*  So people quite often would focus on stimulus confound.
*  So when you change the subjective experience, if you change it by changing the stimulus itself, well, then then you find some differences in the brain.
*  You don't know whether it's because the difference occurs because of the difference in subjective experience or maybe just a physical stimulation itself changes the input.
*  So you need to control for that.
*  And I think it's not a trivial problem, but I think the whole entire field is aware of this problem.
*  And a lot of effort has been spent to address that.
*  And you also need to address things like reporting, right?
*  You don't want to be, let's say you turn an experience on and off.
*  You don't want it to be the case that when the experience is on, they have to report.
*  And when there's no experience, they don't report.
*  Then you have the same reporting confound.
*  And again, I think it's not entirely trivial, but people have dealt with that.
*  And I think it's pretty good.
*  Pretty good. And I think the problem is people is a subtle point, but the confounds that are subtle are actually the worst confounds because the confounds that are relatively obvious.
*  That means that other people would have taken care of it.
*  And if you look at the literature, then then the answers would be mostly immune to those confounds if you look carefully and pick those studies of control for the confound.
*  And task performance capacity is the confound that is so subtle that I think very few people have taken the trouble to control for that.
*  So what I mean is when you're aware of a stimulus, you have a conscious experience.
*  That's good. But you're also more able to do tasks in relation to that stimulus.
*  And you can identify it. You can remember it better.
*  You can talk about your capacity for doing things related to that stimulus is also stronger.
*  And that applies to all the paradigms in consciousness, even though in some cases when you don't have to do a task, right, binocular rivalry.
*  I think when I first raised this question back in almost over a decade and a half ago, people say, well, binocular rivalry doesn't have this problem because you're not asked to do a task.
*  And that's why I realized, OK, I must emphasize is performance capacity confound is not performance confound.
*  Even when you don't ask them to do a task, obviously, when let's say you're seeing a dog and a cat rivalry in a binocular rivalry paradigm, when you see the cat, obviously you're much, much more able to detect subtle changes in the cat image than the dog image.
*  And in fact, that has to be done, has been done so we can we can make people do tasks in the context of binocular rivalry.
*  And of course, unsurprisingly, the image that is conscious is much, much better processed.
*  So that confound is a pretty damning because I think it means that if you're not careful, your theory of consciousness might end up just being a theory of how the brain works.
*  And I suspect that most current theories are actually just how the brain works because that confound is not being taken care of.
*  So when you say I compare the conscious condition and a non conscious condition, these activities in the brain show up when you're conscious.
*  Well, maybe those activities are just driving information processing in some ways.
*  And yeah, of course, when you're conscious, then you can do things you can remember, you can you can do cognition.
*  So so you need to control for that.
*  And some of my colleagues would say, no, no, no, you don't.
*  You absolutely don't need to control for that, because being able to process information is consciousness.
*  So there's no way you can control for that.
*  It's like saying that I try to compare tall people versus short people and less control for the length of the bones.
*  Right. Well, you can't, right, because tall people are tall because their bones are longer.
*  Like that you can't control for the very thing itself.
*  And that's, I think, the when when the issue of the phenomenon of blindsight comes in, because blindsight to me, even if it happens very rarely, and some of the cases are controversial,
*  to the extent that it has ever happened in the entire world to some extent is an empirical counter example to the conceptual identity between consciousness and performance capacity.
*  Let me let me stop you there.
*  I just want to mention because I don't know if I've told you this before.
*  And then we'll talk more about blindsight.
*  But some of your early work on on blindsight was inspirational to me when I was trying to form my own graduate studies.
*  So thanks. I'm not sure if I've ever said this, but thank you.
*  I didn't know.
*  I didn't realize that.
*  I didn't think that I didn't know.
*  Now I realize I'm much older than you are.
*  I always thought I read your paper, the single cell recording paper on on metacognition.
*  That actually was very useful to me, too.
*  But I didn't realize that my work somehow has an impact on you, too.
*  Good.
*  I was trying to it actually helped me devise the task.
*  I'm thinking about the patient UI and those early blindsight studies.
*  And yeah.
*  So anyway, I just wanted to make sure that I didn't forget to express my gratitude to you.
*  So very glad, very glad that makes my day.
*  So blindsight.
*  Yeah. So in blindsight is a case where lesion to the primary visual cortex caused some patients to deny that they are they have any sense of subjectivity.
*  Sometimes the denier is not so complete, right?
*  Some people would say, well, they can see motion, but not static stimuli.
*  And sometimes it applies only to some stimulus parameters.
*  But to the extent that you find those stimulus and then they say they really don't consciously see them.
*  The interesting part is they can guess what the identity of the stimulus.
*  So and what I mean, guess they just you just give them two buttons and they press buttons.
*  So they are basically doing psychophysic tasks like you and I do, because when I do psychophysics tasks, usually people don't ask me if I'm guessing or seeing.
*  They just ask me to press the button.
*  And those patients can do exactly the same.
*  And then they can achieve a fairly high level of accuracy, like 80 percent correct.
*  So D prime of above one.
*  So they have a solid signal to noise ratio of more than one.
*  And so that means that that is a case that demonstrates that the subjective experience is not always required for them to process information.
*  So the two things are not the same.
*  So they're not the same equivalence relations as being tall is having tall having long bones, because now I find a case of a person who is very tall but doesn't have very long bones.
*  So to the extent that that one case has been shown, that means that while the two are different, then you need to control for them.
*  But very few people do.
*  And I think that that is maybe one of the biggest problems the field is facing now.
*  And how does perceptual reality monitoring account for blindsight?
*  Yeah.
*  So the nice thing about these kind of high order theories is that we assume that most of the functional work is done by the first order representations.
*  So just having the strong first order signal would allow you to be able to guess the identity of the of the of the stimulus.
*  So you can do the the the blind side guessing task or any psychophysics task that way.
*  The higher order monitoring or the perceptual reality monitoring is almost like a commentary on the first order signal.
*  So you have a strong ongoing first order signal in the sensory cortex that might be able to guess the identity of the of the of the stimulus.
*  And then you have a high order signal in the sensory cortex that might go through your parietal action channels and allows you to do those tasks.
*  And but on top of that, you almost have a you have a higher order commentary and say, well, this signal now reflects a state right now.
*  So you have to conscious experience.
*  But if that is missing, that's where you have blindsight.
*  And even that in the presence of a very strong first order signal is that, well, no, that's just baseline noise.
*  Let's ignore it. So you don't have the conscious experience.
*  But if the if the first order signal is in fact strong, then it can drive the performance.
*  So you have a performance with our awareness in that case.
*  So presumably there are, quote unquote, normal subjects in the population who may experience what would amount to blindsight on every 15 trials of some task.
*  Right. Because you have this ongoing monitoring situation and sometimes it fails.
*  I mean, is that plausible that it's just sometimes failing to discriminate correctly and therefore would lead to something like a blindsight trial or something?
*  I would think so. I think theoretically and intuitively it is quite plausible.
*  But the empirical demonstration turned out to be really difficult because we don't know what when people just say that they are not conscious in that trial.
*  Maybe they mean that there is it's just faint.
*  And so the empirical demonstration has been hard.
*  And a lot of people are very skeptical of blindsight.
*  Some people are even skeptical whether blindsight existed ever.
*  So that but but I think I think if you go for the more solid evidence to to show the blinds existed at least in some conditions under some rare patients, I think that that is a defensible position.
*  So, Hakwan, I want to we'll wrap up here with just a couple sort of broader questions again.
*  You know, like I've repeated multiple times, you really analyze a lot of these studies and the potential confounds and the issues to empirically studying consciousness.
*  And and throughout your career, you have spent you've devoted part of your career to testing other people's theories.
*  Right. And and testing your own.
*  And also generating your own, which you're in the midst of with the perceptual perceptual reality monitoring and the mental quality space.
*  And that's going to continue.
*  What's the right balance between one could spend a lifetime, an academic lifetime, just testing other people's theories?
*  What's the right balance between testing other people's theories and searching for the right controls, et cetera, versus generating your own and working on your own pushing forward?
*  Yeah, I might give a recursive answer to that.
*  I in the form that whatever balance did one think it is, I think we should just do more empirical stuff.
*  So I think so if you assume if you feel like, OK, I want to spend what X amount like X percent of my time thinking of theory dial it down, you would you would never regret it.
*  I actually when I wrote the book, I sent it to one of my good friend and colleague, Richard Brown.
*  And the first comment he gave was, but the book seems structural, seems to be structured funny.
*  Like, why would you introduce your theory only in Chapter seven?
*  And then maybe the most novel idea of mental quality spaces in the final chapter nine.
*  What would you put it in the front?
*  And I think it reflects that that sentiment or or advice I just gave.
*  I think we should just place much more emphasis on doing the experiments right.
*  And I kind of reluctantly get into theory because at some point I needed to address some some issues.
*  And I and I just say I have an inclination.
*  I hang out with philosophers, maybe too much.
*  And then I and I like thinking about this.
*  But every time I do it, I do try to remind myself this is an indulgence and it's an indulgence that has not served a few too too well.
*  So I constantly try to force myself to do less theory and more more more careful experiments.
*  Even the theory is fun.
*  I mean, everybody loves doing them.
*  In your day to day thinking and research, are do you find more stubborn the philosophical problems or the empirical problems or challenges?
*  I think ultimately the philosophical problems are harder.
*  But in this but I think the empirical challenges are more stubborn in some ways.
*  It kind of relates to what I talked about earlier.
*  I think in philosophy, I think the most important thing is to understand the problem.
*  In philosophy, at least you can be not so subtle.
*  You can just you can throw the kitchen sink at your best friend and you can still go for a beer afterwards and they might like you.
*  They might continue to like you strangely.
*  Whereas in science, I think you have to worry about stepping on people's toes a little bit more.
*  And given the state it is, I think doing empirical work can be quite challenging for for not, you know, not not very necessary reasons.
*  Thinking back to your earlier career and you don't have to go all the way back to the beginning.
*  But do you feel like the problem of consciousness feels bigger to you now or smaller to you now than then?
*  Yeah, that's a good question. I think it's kind of both.
*  I think we have made some progress.
*  I wouldn't say we solved the problem as I know, acknowledge I don't think so.
*  But I think we have made some progress in the sense the problem is easier.
*  But it with respect to my own life has certainly got a lot bigger.
*  It become much more all consuming and the challenges grew into different dimensions.
*  So when I started out, I didn't think of funding.
*  I didn't think of the importance of placing my mentees continue to grow the field and keep a healthy culture and go, you know, try to fight back on some of these over emphasis on stardom and public engagement.
*  And so so that has become a much bigger problem, much bigger than I even even bigger than I could contemplate back then.
*  So, again, you know, you detail a lot of studies in the book.
*  What percentage of empirical studies about consciousness do we need to just throw away because of all the confounds?
*  I would think the majority of it.
*  Yeah, it hurts.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  I mean, maybe not throw away, but we have to really think about them in a much more skeptical way.
*  Because just to the task performance capacity confound, it's really everywhere.
*  It's really everywhere.
*  So all the theories of consciousness has this similar flavor that consciousness is something bigger, better, stronger, more stable, more global, more deeper, more predictive.
*  More complex, more integrated.
*  And yeah, that sounds like how the brain should work.
*  And maybe that's exactly because of that confound giving you the flavor that you think you're studying consciousness, but you're just studying how how information processing works most efficiently.
*  So so maybe we don't throw them away.
*  But the recognition of that means that we have to redo a lot of these stuff and it's going to be a lot of work.
*  Let's let's end on a high note here.
*  Speculating on your own future trajectory.
*  Where are you in terms of the maturity of the perceptual reality monitoring and including quality space?
*  And as you project forward, where do you see yourself on the curve of your of your theories and and your empirical research to test the theories?
*  Because that's what you're primarily concerned with, or at least a lot of what your concerns are.
*  Where are you on that curve?
*  Are you at the beginning?
*  Are you is it halfway mature?
*  What do you think?
*  I think when it comes to perceptual reality monitoring, I am feeling pretty good about it.
*  I think the details are probably my version would be wrong, but I already see other people picking up on my slack and and innovating and doing better versions of it.
*  So Sam Gershman wrote a piece that a similar Mizzou Kawato, another really majorly influential scholars in the machine learning world, has also gotten into this problem.
*  And I think they would they would do well.
*  Even I, my version would probably fail, but I think the field would do OK.
*  But when it comes to the mental quality space aspect, I think we are really still at the very infancy.
*  And and that's good.
*  That means that there's more more work to be done.
*  I don't I don't have to retire myself so soon.
*  You can you can let passing him know that the fight is still going on strong and for many, many more moons to come.
*  Well, thanks for the book, Hakuan.
*  And like I said, I think among other things, it's just going to be a super valuable resource for anyone getting, you know, thinking about getting into empirically studying consciousness, because damn it.
*  There's a lot of confounds and a lot to consider.
