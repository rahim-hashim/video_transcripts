Karen Adolph runs the Infant Action Lab at NYU, where she studies how our motor behaviors develop from infancy onward. We discuss how observing babies at different stages of development illuminates how movement and cognition develop in humans, how variability and embodiment are key to that development, and the importance of studying behavior in real-world settings as opposed to restricted laboratory settings. We also explore how these principles and simulations can inspire advances in intelligent robots. Karen has a long-standing interest in ecological psychology, and she shares some stories of her time studying under Eleanor Gibson and other mentors.
Finally, we get a surprise visit from her partner Mark Blumberg, with whom she co-authored an opinion piece arguing that "motor cortex" doesn't start off with a motor function, oddly enough, but instead processes sensory information during the first period of animals' lives.

# BI 197 Karen Adolph How Babies Learn to Move and Think
**Brain Inspired:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V93opwkTAjM)
*  My diabolical scheme is to use simulated robots to understand behavior, but their diabolical
*  scheme is to use developing behavior to build better robots.
*  You know, like we saw children do things in hammering the peg that no one would ever have
*  imagined that a child would do.
*  We actually right now, we as a field, because if Kirin Adolf can do it, anyone can do it.
*  We have all the tools and technology to do the whole enchilada.
*  This is Brain Inspired, powered by the transmitter.
*  Hey everyone, I'm Paul.
*  I'm a neuroscience researcher at Carnegie Mellon University.
*  I also have children.
*  So I was witness early on to their tiny bodies fumbling about the world as they learned to
*  crawl and then walk and then run and jump.
*  But I haven't seen nearly as many babies do that as my guest today, Kirin Adolf.
*  Kirin runs the Infant Action Lab at New York University, NYU, where she studies how our
*  motor behaviors develop from infancy onward.
*  We discuss how observing babies at different stages of development illuminates how movement
*  and cognition develop in humans, how variability and embodiment are key to that development,
*  and the importance of studying behavior in real world settings as opposed to more restricted
*  laboratory settings.
*  We also explore how these principles, together with simulations, can inspire advances in
*  intelligent robots.
*  Kirin has a longstanding interest in ecological psychology, which we have discussed multiple
*  times over the past month or two on this podcast.
*  And so she shares some stories of her time studying under Eleanor Gibson, the developmental
*  ecological psychologist who was a colleague of the well-known ecological psychologist,
*  the what would you say, originator perhaps of ecological psychology, James Gibson.
*  So she talks about her time with Eleanor and some of her other mentors.
*  And finally, we get a surprise visit from Kirin's partner, Mark Blumberg, with whom
*  she co-authored an opinion piece arguing that, quote unquote, motor cortex doesn't actually
*  start off with a motor function, oddly enough, but instead processes sensory information
*  during the first period of animals' lives.
*  Okay, I'll link to the papers associated with the topics I just mentioned and which
*  we discuss in this episode at braininspired.co.uk slash podcast slash 197.
*  Those church bells in the background tell me that it's time to quit this introduction
*  and get into the episode.
*  So thank you to all my Patreon supporters.
*  Learn more at braininspired.co how to do that and join our Discord community and even influence
*  who comes on this podcast.
*  And thank you as always to the transmitter for their awesome support of the show.
*  All right, here's Kirin.
*  Kirin, you're busy.
*  You've been busy for a long time.
*  Do you feel just overwhelmed all the time?
*  No.
*  I have the best job in the world.
*  I really do.
*  I have the best job in the world.
*  Is that right?
*  Mm hmm.
*  Why humans?
*  Why human?
*  Why do I study human behavior?
*  Yeah.
*  As opposed to some other animal model.
*  It was, why?
*  Because you have to know your organism.
*  And so I worked my way through college working with three and four year olds and I really
*  know young children and babies.
*  But I'm about to do a piglet study in September.
*  Pigs at the edge of a drop off.
*  And, you know, we got some chick stuff on the horizon.
*  There's no, it could be any animal.
*  You know, pretty much anything I've learned about any animal, they all produce amazing
*  beautiful behaviors that learn and develop.
*  So could have been any animal.
*  It's just I have a better feeling for the human animal.
*  And it was, has it always been development in particular that you've been interested
*  in and the behavior?
*  Yeah, I'll tell you why.
*  So I was, I was, you know, I was one of those children that was your parents' first nightmare.
*  Well, among them.
*  So I went to four colleges.
*  By the time I was at Sarah Lawrence, my fourth, I was paying my own way.
*  And I ended up so convoluted, I ended up at Sarah Lawrence because I wanted to study
*  printmaking with this famous, amazing Japanese woodcut printmaker, Aso Uchima.
*  And he told me that everything he had done to date at that point, I believe he was right,
*  was like self-indulgent drivel.
*  And then I needed to become a better draftsman.
*  And so while everyone else in the class is doing other things, he would bring me
*  things to draw.
*  And they were usually like some branch, you know, it's a twig of something that sprig of
*  something that he plucked on his way into the studio.
*  And he would put it down and say, draw it.
*  And then I always came up short.
*  And he said, you need to just tell yourself and really look so that you can understand
*  how it grows.
*  And I got really kind of pretty good at doing that.
*  And then through another convoluted story, I ended up doing my doctoral work in part
*  with Eleanor Gibson.
*  So I considered her my primary advisor.
*  And her main advice was actually the same, but only about behavior.
*  Just shut up, sit still, clear, open your mind, and, you know, let the behavior speak to you.
*  But she wasn't telling you that your work was drivel.
*  Oh, she sure did.
*  She mostly she had these things she would say that our work was fine, just fine or fun.
*  And it drove me crazy because I never knew whether fine was better than just fine or just fine was
*  better than fine.
*  And I'd say, Jackie, Jackie, which one's better?
*  Am I striving for just fine or fine?
*  I don't care.
*  So I'll tell you a funny story.
*  I think I was my second faculty job and moved to NYU.
*  Then that means I was tenured.
*  And so I was doing fine.
*  I was doing just fine or fine.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah, one of those.
*  One of those.
*  And it was the olden days.
*  So we had answering machines and the light was flashing.
*  And I pressed play and it was Eleanor Gibson saying, you know, Sharon, dear, thank you so
*  much for sending me the chapter article, whatever you wrote.
*  I think it's terrific.
*  And it was so fun to read.
*  And, you know, she said a few other things.
*  Then then I pressed the thing again.
*  I took another look at your article and while it's fine, there's a few things we need to
*  discuss.
*  And then literally there was a third message and she said, we really need to talk before
*  you send this.
*  So I don't know that I was a disappointment to her.
*  And I think she loved me.
*  That I know.
*  I don't think she considered me her best student.
*  But in the end, I might turn out to have been a best student.
*  We'll see.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, how did you did that kind of criticism?
*  Because some people would wilt under that kind of criticism.
*  You know what?
*  When I wrote my dissertation, my three advisors were Ulrich Neisser, the father of cognitive
*  psychology, Eleanor Gibson, Jackie Gibson, whatever, the mother of behavioral, you know,
*  whatever.
*  And Esther Thielen, who invented dynamic systems.
*  And all three hated it.
*  But for different reasons, Eleanor Gibson said, Karen, I had to stop reading at the
*  title.
*  It just won't do.
*  I couldn't read past the title.
*  So that was pretty bad.
*  Digniser, it was the way I presented the results.
*  And Esther Thielen kept saying, but I've written things with you.
*  Did you write this?
*  I mean, did you write?
*  Because I've written things with you.
*  And like, what was that?
*  Did you really write that?
*  Why would you?
*  Karen, why would you write that?
*  So, you know, it was the olden days.
*  We had the five inch floppy disk.
*  I took the whole thing and all the paper cut, threw it in the trash, started over, said,
*  Jackie, how about this title?
*  Okay, dear, you can continue.
*  Esther, I'm going to show it to you section by section.
*  She gave me the thumbs up and I got to the results and Digniser.
*  But that's intense beneficial training in the long run.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm not a wilter.
*  I'm just a get back on and keep going person.
*  So did you?
*  I haven't published these episodes yet, but I have a few episodes specifically on
*  ecological psychology with a few people.
*  And did your interest in ecological psychology begin with Eleanor?
*  No.
*  So there I was at Sarah Lawrence working in the Early Childhood Center,
*  paying my way through college.
*  And I took a class on perception because I thought it would help me to understand.
*  And that's the kind of thing that all the...
*  Okay, so Sarah Lawrence had just gone coed and there's like five men, all gay dancers,
*  whatever.
*  And all these women, we all look the same, you know, hair to our waist,
*  black clothes, wafting through the campus.
*  What year is this?
*  The 80s.
*  What decade is this?
*  And meeting in the pub, smoking cigarettes, discussing like,
*  but how do I know it's a rock?
*  And deep questions like that.
*  Wait, what did you ask me?
*  Just about your interest in ecological psychology.
*  No, no, no.
*  So I was taking perception.
*  And I was taking perception with this guy named Bob Beckland, who had been a doctoral
*  student at Cornell.
*  So he knew James Gibson very well.
*  And Ulrich Neisser was his dissertation advisor.
*  And he knew Eleanor Gibson as a by-product.
*  She wasn't on their official faculty because of nepotism.
*  So it's a whole other amazing story.
*  But anyway, he knew the Gipsons.
*  So the first semester was a traditional perception class.
*  And it was supposed to be a two semester, like, you know, fall and then spring semester
*  long class.
*  And I went to him and the end of the fall semester, after we'd learned, you know,
*  about the chambered eye and the blind spot and all these optical illusions,
*  whatever the hell you teach them, traditional perception.
*  And I went to him in tears and I said, Bob, I have to drop your class.
*  I just know this is not how we see it.
*  Just everything about it feels wrong.
*  I this is not for me.
*  And it's not helping me.
*  But I wanted to understand how you get light into a painting.
*  So, yeah, it's not helping me to understand my painting.
*  You know, bye bye.
*  And he said, well, all right, before you leave, just read this book over the Christmas
*  break and then see if you still want to drop the class.
*  And he gave me James Gibson's The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems.
*  And it was like I found religion.
*  I copied most of the book into my journals, like, because I had to give the book back.
*  And, you know, and so he was he died in seventy nine and honor Gibson was still alive.
*  And so I wanted to.
*  In the end, when I decided to do a doctoral program, I wanted to work with her.
*  And one of the things I've asked a recent guest about is so
*  Louis Favela is the guest I'm talking about right now.
*  He's written this book that's trying to connect ecological psychology and neuroscience,
*  the neurosciences and which is all well and good.
*  One of the interesting things to me, though, is that yes, I know Eleanor continued the
*  Gibsonian work, but ecological psychology, I guess, Gibsonian ecological psychology.
*  It's like from one person and it's essentially remained the same over time.
*  Correct.
*  I don't think so.
*  No, I mean, because James Gibson is always, you know, the person mentioned.
*  And then just the concepts, you know, the continued affordances, continuous perception,
*  action cycle, direct perception, those have all been core tenants.
*  And it's just odd to me that from my perception, and you please correct me that those core
*  tenants have remained remained in place, whereas I'm so I'm thinking about it in
*  comparison to neuroscience, which has had many, many different influences.
*  But ecological psychology all like seems to go back to one person.
*  And I know Eleanor doesn't get as much credit as she deserves.
*  Right.
*  But yeah, so you're sort of correct and you're sort of wrong in an orthogonal way.
*  I mean, they're married.
*  She read everything he wrote.
*  They published only two things together and she has publications spanning 70 something years.
*  She was not his partner.
*  She was not and she was not his muse.
*  She was not anything.
*  She was just her own separate person.
*  And he was really I mean, I never met the man.
*  I only heard about him through her and I read his stuff.
*  He was more interested in kind of epistemological questions.
*  And she's she was really like, shut up, look at the behaviors and let the data speak to you.
*  Like that was her.
*  You know, she started as a comparative psychologist and
*  she studying sort of she would have been studying nonhuman primates if they had let her do that.
*  Yeah.
*  And she ended up starting out in a rat lab.
*  So some of James Gibson's ideas are now so
*  meshed into the literature that people don't even know that it's him.
*  You know, like, like optic flow.
*  But what's really behind that is you can only understand a process,
*  which is a thing that takes place over time.
*  If you study things that take place over time.
*  And so all his notions are really these time based notions.
*  And, you know, about patterns over time, not stopping time in some fictional way,
*  like as if it's a photograph that's continuous.
*  Some of his ideas like affordance are also like kind of out there in the literature,
*  but in a much sloppier way.
*  So when I talk with young roboticists, for example,
*  Well, there's a generation that I just get like free, free revering from them because,
*  you know, you do, you know, you know, but, but, but they all, you know,
*  BND the term affordance around, they have no idea what they're saying, where it came from.
*  And they mostly it's meaningless the way they're saying that, you know,
*  because it's gotten too watered down.
*  I just could mean anything.
*  It's like a helping word, you know, just what does it mean?
*  Well, I think I know what James Gibson thought it means.
*  I think I know what Eleanor Gibson thought it means.
*  And then I think I know what I think it means.
*  And those are three different things.
*  Wow.
*  See, that's, that's a problem, isn't it?
*  Why?
*  I mean, the neuroscientists, for example,
*  I'm a neuroscientist and we're sort of famously bad at using words that we all mean different
*  things by them, like the word representation, right?
*  That has a thousand different meanings.
*  And, and so it, what gets lost is what happens is people are just talking past each other
*  all the time.
*  And I thought that that would not be the case in ecological psychology because
*  I know this is not fair, but you know, it all kind of originates in this very narrow,
*  narrowly defined way.
*  And I know that, I know that James Gibson like changed his, you know,
*  notions of things over time as well.
*  I mean, I guess I would say, sure, I'm an ecological psychologist,
*  but no, I'm just myself.
*  And if anything, I'm first and foremost a developmental scientist.
*  And it's not in conflict with ecological psychology.
*  And so like the sort of pre-theoretical assumptions all come from there.
*  Something like direct perception.
*  I don't care.
*  I'm not, I'm not committed to,
*  I guess the only things I'm committed to, I think are absolutely facts.
*  And anyone who's not committed to those things is an idiot.
*  Like we live in real time.
*  That's the way it happens.
*  And if you don't, if you want to understand a process,
*  you have to understand how change happens over time.
*  The end, it's a fact, you know, an affordance to my mind is a fact.
*  It's the fit between a set of characteristics in the environment,
*  a set of characteristics in a particular animal that make a particular action possible
*  or not, or possible with some probability.
*  That's a fact.
*  Like, I don't think anyone who thinks about it would argue with that.
*  Whether people can perceive affordances for action and how they perceive it.
*  That's still up in the air.
*  And I don't know the answer to that.
*  Probably we have to perceive affordances because otherwise I don't see how any animal can,
*  you know, get around and, you know, be like a functional animal in an environment.
*  But affordances are a fact.
*  Define the way I've said it.
*  You know, if you want to say an afford, you know, like,
*  like, like, like the zoom call for its learning for listeners,
*  well, you've not said anything.
*  But if you want to say like, to perform a motor action,
*  stuff has to be true about the environment,
*  stuff has to be true about the animal and they have to merge in some way.
*  That's a fact.
*  And that's just by mechanics done.
*  So something like the term mind, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So neuroscientists think, you know, a lot of a lot of us think that the mind is what brains do.
*  An ecological psychologist thinks that mind is more relational, right?
*  And not located in brain so much as the brain body environment system.
*  Where what is your conception of mind or do you is it is this another thing that doesn't matter?
*  I don't think about it like that.
*  I think about processes like thinking and remembering and hoping and planning
*  and believing and desiring and whatever.
*  And sure, people and human babies and lots of animals do lots of those kinds of things.
*  But those are processes and they are
*  processes that have to do with, you know, all the body parts.
*  So brain, but also like eyes and feet and skin and whatever and other people
*  and the environment and all the rest of it.
*  So yeah.
*  You are pro embodiment.
*  For sure.
*  Well, I think there's a lot of ease.
*  You know, I wrote a paper with a lot of ease before I realized that other people were also into that.
*  Of course, behavior is embodied.
*  How else could it happen?
*  But of course, it's also embedded in the environment.
*  Where else could it happen?
*  There's always an environment.
*  It's also enculturated because, at least in people and in many kinds of animals,
*  because there's other creatures around that have minimally affected the environment,
*  but also influence behaviors.
*  And it's also enabling so that one thing can lead to another thing.
*  We can affect change on our environment.
*  The environment can affect change on our body and behavior.
*  I would say that behavior is embodied, embedded, enculturated and enabling.
*  Probably some other use, but at least there's data about it.
*  So you're referring to the, was it the annual reviews in the developmental psychology?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a really nice piece.
*  And I'll link to these things that we're talking about.
*  Let's take then kind of a drastic turn because I want to hear your thoughts about modern
*  artificial intelligence and how it relates to the way that you think about
*  cognition and natural intelligence.
*  Because then I want to bring it back to development.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that, so at some point, someone had posed the ultimate AI challenge beating
*  a grand chess master at chess.
*  And then Deep Blue did it.
*  But when you watch it, it's hilarious because there's like a computer and then there's like
*  a guy who is translating the moves, you know, to tell the computer where the pieces are
*  and then taking the computer's output and moving the pieces for the human player.
*  So, all right, Kasparov lost the game, but the guy is like moving his own freaking chess
*  pieces around and knowing where Deep Blue moved his chess pieces and Deep Blue couldn't do any of
*  that. So then that challenge got replaced with, you know, a kind of RoboCup challenge.
*  You know, if we can, like true intelligence would be building robots that could be, you know,
*  the best human World Cup champions or whatever.
*  And, you know, so one of the originators and also one of the people who's been most successful at
*  winning RoboCup and various simulated and real robot divisions is Peter Stone.
*  And I've very much, you know, been blessed to work with him and other robot engineers.
*  Been blessed to work with him and other roboticists, Alan Ferns group at Oregon Steed and
*  Lerl Pinto at NYU. I think that, sorry, what was your question? AI in mind or something like that?
*  Yeah, just your take on AI and because of the disembodiment, right? And what I really want to
*  ask you. So, you know, the most helpful part about computer science in general for
*  behavioral scientists, neuroscientists, et cetera, is, you know, make your ideas explicit in some
*  ways. Now, I think there's great power in metaphor and the most truly powerful theories
*  in developmental science are all at the metaphor level, like Piafray's, whatever. I mean, he's
*  wrong, but truly powerful. But it's really helpful when you can boil it all down. And that's my
*  Carnegie Mellon background, you know, coming out and put it in a formal model. But why not put it
*  in a formal model in a real thing like a robot? That's the ultimate formal model. Now, real robots
*  are not very good. They're really clunky. And, you know, an 18-month-old human toddler can run
*  circles around the best one of those. But a robot simulation has a lot to offer, you know,
*  behavioral scientists and neuroscientists at this point.
*  Computer vision has a lot to offer. But I think developmental science has a lot to offer to AI.
*  Like, one easy example back to the robots is that, like a human infant, for example,
*  they learn so much so fast, I think in part because what they need to learn is constrained
*  by their bodies and their bodies constrain their effective environment. So it's not a blooming,
*  buzzing confusion, because most of the environment isn't impinging on them at all. Like, it's like,
*  it doesn't exist because they don't have any access to the environment. And so,
*  they don't see it or hear it or whatever. So who cares? Whatever. Right? And then as they get new
*  behavioral skills, their environment expands. And they're continually pushing their own skills and
*  the expansion of their own environment. And so, you know, think about like learning to walk.
*  Literally, a baby can wake up and find themselves two centimeters taller than they were
*  when they went to sleep. Their body is different. And, you know, yesterday, they couldn't stand up
*  at all. Now they can stand up. A week from now, they can take steps. So that baby is never going
*  to get stuck learning any fixed fact at all. It's never going to learn, I'm a crap walker,
*  or I'm a wonderful walker, because what he was yesterday isn't true anymore today. It's never
*  going to learn, you know, don't move this or don't step on the carpet because you'll fall.
*  Because turning his head made him fall. Like, he doesn't, you know. So the system is geared
*  toward, you know, that's true for motor behaviors, that's true for language, it's true for social
*  interaction. The system is geared toward flexible, generative, creative learning.
*  And that would be a great lesson for AI. And I think that some people in AI are hearing this,
*  you know, loud and clear. It's hard to implement right now in a robot, but totally doable in
*  simulation. And, you know, there's some really smart people out there that are really interested
*  in these questions. But in so for example, well, any organism, let's take humans,
*  one could argue that those developmental changes that are happening that enable the context to
*  change because the environment, environmental access changes where you where baby can even
*  position its head and look changes and it's, you know, it's growing and its coordination is
*  changing. That that might could be a bug instead of a feature. Like it's a necessary thing,
*  just because we have to be born kind of small. And our bodies go through these changes.
*  There's lots of things that could be bugs, or they could be features. And it's totally possible that
*  all the animals in the animal kingdom, and they all develop, you know, this was a kind of a,
*  you know, like, like a bug, but something that just like a byproduct, and you can gloss over it.
*  But you can test that. And you can ask, is it actually a feature or a bug? And it turns out
*  all the variability is absolutely a feature that leads to, you know, better, faster learning,
*  more generative learning, better transfer, you know, everything, at least to winning more games
*  in RoboCop. But is there something about development specifically that makes it a necessary
*  way forward to that high amount of flexibility and rapid learning?
*  Couldn't you just figure out the algorithms necessary for it and build it in a computer?
*  I'm playing devil's advocate here.
*  I think you'd have to also structure the learning curriculum just right. And so,
*  you know, like currently with Peterstone's lab, and Alan Byrne's lab, we're trying to do exactly
*  that, you know, like in simulation. Yeah, they don't want to necessarily
*  have a robot that develops, but if they could understand what the optimal curriculum is,
*  then, you know, then they could have their, their, their algorithms be exposed to the
*  right environments at the right time so that the algorithms become as powerful as a human child.
*  If they could do that, I mean, forget getting to like,
*  if they could do that, I mean, forget getting to like, you know, our level, adult level, or whatever,
*  you don't need wisdom, you just need a robot that's like a two year old. And then, you know, man,
*  that'd be amazing. So you don't think that there is something special about the way our bodies
*  change and the fact that we are embodied and it's always a relation between our,
*  our body and the environment and affordances, I'll say,
*  that would be necessarily missing in a robot that wouldn't go through those
*  changes, because it's always had the same body?
*  We might need to change its body. I don't know. I mean,
*  I mean, my diabolical scheme is to use simulated robots to understand behavior,
*  but their diabolical scheme is to use developing behavior to build better robots. And it might
*  turn out, you've got to have a robot whose body can change and you can't do it all with, you know,
*  sort of meeting out the environment and, and, and, you know, adjusting the algorithms.
*  That's their problem. They'll figure it out. You know, maybe, maybe with your help. How much does
*  embodiment matter once we're fully developed? It always matters. It always matters. But how much
*  is the, you know, because it seems to maybe one could argue that it might matter more as we're
*  developing because we are like all of our cognition develops as you've studied over many years
*  many years in congruence with our bodily changes.
*  You're in that happy point of life. I can tell you from the other side,
*  we are always developing and our bodies are always developing.
*  Gravity might be your power right now, but gravity is not your long term friend.
*  No, I mean, I love watching.
*  You know what I mean? No, seriously, we're always developing your body is always changing. And your
*  body is changing when you put on your sneakers or take them off in your beer,
*  feather and your socks, your body's changing when you put up your backpack or
*  your functional body is always changing because you're always doing things.
*  And so every, every plan you make, every action you take has to take the current status of your
*  body into account. And, and even, you know, raising your arms changes your body and changes what you
*  can do. So yeah, you're always embodied and, and you actually are always developing. It may not be
*  it's just, you know, like development is different across the lifespan,
*  which things grow and which things shrink or, or sag or whatever, but, but you're always changing.
*  I remember when I was younger and falling was actually kind of fun. I mean, first of all,
*  you'd be fine if you fell. And I remember actually enjoying it. And I used to like fall
*  on purpose to make my friends laugh because it was just hilarious. And I can't,
*  I don't look forward to falling anymore. But this is one of the things that you studied, just how
*  much developing infants and babies just fall and just get up and are fine. And they're just tumbling
*  around the world and enjoying it. Yeah. Maybe what you're referring to is like the three to six year
*  old period when children twirl in circles and, you know, stand in the snow drift or a leaf pile,
*  you know, Oh, I used to be able to stand straight up. And this was still when I was like a teenager
*  and just fall face forward on concrete and just put my hands down and beep and be fine. I know
*  I'm not going to try that today. No. I, I don't think that babies enjoy falling. And I don't think
*  in general, they're doing it to amuse anyone. I just think it's, it's pretty trivial.
*  And they, it happens so often and it's pretty trivial. And when it's not trivial, you know,
*  they probably die, but that's a tiny proportion of the time. And so, and never in your lab,
*  you know, knock one, you know, like when we, you know, originally like years ago, I had parents
*  keep a diary of every time their parents, their babies fell. And it was 1.2 times a month,
*  you know, then we put video cameras on babies and just videotape how often they fall. And,
*  you know, like a new walker falls 35 times an hour or something. Yeah. Babies fall 70 something
*  times per hour in motion, you know, like, but, and then, you know, we've microanalyzed the falls
*  and they truly are trivial. You know, a baby on average is back at play, like, you know, from,
*  from like fully torso on the floor, you know, to, to up and running around again in under two seconds.
*  So, but think about it like this. And the, in the beginning, babies fall because their legs give out,
*  they're just standing there and their legs collapse. Or they literally, they turn their
*  head or lift an arm and it tips them off balance and they fall. So would you want a robot or a baby
*  to learn never turn your head, never take a step, never lift your arm? Of course not. So,
*  so they, they ignore it, you know, because it doesn't matter. And so,
*  so they ignore it. Wait, who ignores what? Babies ignore falling? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And
*  if you have a robot ignore it, so there's zero penalty for falling. It learns better, faster,
*  deeper, better transfer, et cetera. So, but think it's not, it's not just motor actions, like, you
*  know, so if a baby learned that every time it said a word and mispronounced it, it would get a
*  penalty. We would never learn to talk, you know, set an algorithm, you would never learn to talk.
*  You just shut down the system. So, you know, for, for things that really need to be
*  highly generative, highly creative, highly flexible,
*  you know, you have to allow others.
*  So what do you, what is your prospect about AI in general? You know, do you think if, if, if only
*  they added what's, what's, what we learn in development that will solve it? Do you think
*  it's something that is poorly defined in the first place? Because we don't, you know, we talk, we used
*  the term intelligence differently when we're talking about organisms versus
*  computers, for example. Or do you not think about it? Well,
*  I know you don't, you don't have to think about things like large language models. Why? We've been
*  testing, I guess, is the right word. You're using testing
*  automatic speech recognition tools like whisper for transcription because human transcription
*  takes a really long time. And I'm talking not about like newscaster transcription and against
*  the background of quiet, but babies vocalizations and mothers, infant directed speech or caregivers
*  and mothers, infant directed speech and noisy, you know, cluttery, noisily cluttery environments.
*  And also with code switching among languages, et cetera. And humans can do it. Highly accurate.
*  You know, automatic speech recognition can sort of do it, sort of so far. But, you know, like if you
*  run the same exact algorithm multiple times, you'll get different answers over different runs.
*  A lot of the answers involve huge amounts of hallucinations where it just makes up stuff that
*  never happened. Part of it is that the input to most of the AI models for speech, for behavior,
*  for computer vision, whatever, are scraped off the web and they're not, you know, they're not,
*  it's not good input. I don't know if you know about the data brave video library, but this is,
*  this is the world's only large scale repository, digital repository for research video.
*  This was started by your team, right?
*  Yes.
*  And, you know, this, I don't know, I think there's 790 universities around the globe who are now
*  authorized to access this. So it's a controlled access repository with open sharing within the
*  users of the repository. Not for commercial purposes, not for, you know, some company to
*  make money by learning your bread elections and what things are in your home, but for researchers,
*  including AI researchers, to have, you know, really good data. A lot of it is human annotated
*  or human transcribed. So there's a lot of, you know, gold standard data sets in data bravery.
*  I think things like that will help AI. I try not to think about the nefarious uses of AI
*  and I try to think more about how, like what I said to start, you know, how AI can help
*  behavioral scientists, including developmental scientists to understand
*  behavioral processes more deeply and more accurately.
*  How has the modern technology, machine learning techniques, tracking techniques,
*  changed or improved your research? I mean, you were just mentioning earlier that you used to ask
*  people to just observe their children at home, right? And keep a little diary. And now you have
*  people bring their babies and kids in the lab. You can track their every, you know, movement and
*  really quantify things where they're looking. They can be wearing an EEG cap while they're
*  doing some task. You can track their, one of the things that you've done is how babies at
*  different stages of development will make different errors in picking up a hammer that has a different
*  orientations, wooden hammer, not a lethal hammer. So has that been like a, I hate to use the phrase
*  game changer, but you know, are we, are you in the best place ever in terms of the tools that
*  are available? Has it changed how you do your research? I'm a great fan of technology,
*  you know, but, and because I'm in movement science, people in movement science have been using
*  recording technologies forever, long before anyone in, you know, sort of mainstream psychology or
*  cognitive science and neuroscience had the ability or even realize it would be important to do.
*  And everyone trained as I was, you know, one of the golden rules is you, you use technology
*  to answer the questions you have, you're not led around by the technology. And so,
*  I mean, one of the things I'm most proud of is my lab was Jason Babcock developed the first,
*  so Jason Babcock is the owner of Positive Science, but we developed the first head-mounted eye tracker
*  for infants and children while they're fully mobile. So babies, children could run around,
*  do whatever, you know, in their home, in the lab, walk over apparatuses, narrow bridges,
*  whatever, all while wearing a head-mounted eye tracker that actually tracks their point of
*  gaze in the scene. So not just like a GoPro on their head, but like actual eye tracking.
*  Amazing. But if I had to choose what I'd rather have, a head-mounted eye tracker on a baby or a
*  third-person camera that gets the whole scene, I'd pick the third-person camera in a nanosecond.
*  Head-mounted eye tracking tells you one kind of thing, third-person camera tells you another
*  kind of thing. The lessons is that you're using it all. You're using so many tools at once.
*  Yeah, I would, I'm, yeah, I do a lot of things in combination, but so, so for a lot of the behaviors
*  that I'm interested in, it's not, it's prohibitive or at least it's not nice or practical to put too
*  much stuff on the baby. So we try to have everything like, you know, can't like instrument
*  the floor rather than instrumenting the baby or use computer vision to track the baby's join angles
*  rather than putting markers on the baby or wires on the baby, et cetera. So,
*  you know, like it's interesting, like it's, there's so like,
*  for a human, it's absolutely trivial to know if a baby is taking steps. And I'm not talking about
*  baby's stepping as if they're walking on a treadmill. I'm talking about babies taking their
*  natural steps as they approach an obstacle during play. So the steps are like in place or backward,
*  or they kind of slither foot or, you know, every direction, you know, windy paths, the whole thing.
*  And if I showed you a video right now, we could both like in unison say, step, step, not a step,
*  step, step, step, not a step like that. Really hard for machine learning to do that kind of a thing.
*  You know, it's not up to the task. On the other hand, computer vision can tell you the exact
*  XYZ coordinates of the feet. If the space is calibrated, the human can tell you the exact
*  coordinates of the feet. If the space is calibrated, the human can't do that. A human could say,
*  you know, like if I were wearing a head-mounted eye tracker, a human could say I'm looking at
*  the wooden wall, but it can't say which pixels on the wall I'm actually looking at and which are
*  out of my field of view. You know, a human can say you took a step, but it can't, you know,
*  it can't say exactly what are the XYZ coordinates. So it's like a happy marriage where you find the
*  right technologies and the right tools, some of which are humans, and you can build tools to
*  augment human abilities. So one of the data-based suite of tools is DataView, which is a human
*  computerized video annotation tool, you know, where user-defined events, behaviors can be
*  time-locked to their location in the video. But you need stuff like that. Like if you don't have
*  that tool and you're like writing it down with paper and pencil, it's just prohibitively expensive
*  and horrible and not accurate enough to do. But, you know, with a tool that gives you like perfect
*  playback over the video and you can go forward or backward at different speeds with like
*  fingertip control and you never have to touch your mouse. Like that's an amazing tool.
*  And that augments our human abilities. So that's how I feel about it. You know,
*  technologies are amazing and I've always... I'm very proud of the work that has come out of my lab
*  where we push technologies forward, you know, instead of just measuring babies walking in a
*  straight line, which you have to force them to do, using an instrumented floor to see what
*  natural locomotion really looks like and what the gait parameters look like there. I mean,
*  but I think it's very important that the neurosciences and behavioral sciences,
*  developmental sciences are not getting led around by the promise or existence of certain tools.
*  Am I right to say that looking time studies in babies was kind of the gold standard for a long
*  time? And what I want to ask you is, is that over? Does anyone still do looking time?
*  Unfortunately and shamefully, it is long from over, not over. And I think we need to be very
*  clear what's a looking time study. Yeah. Thank you. That's what I was going to ask.
*  Yeah. So looking is an incredibly beautiful, amazing, important motor behavior. And coming
*  back to where we started, you know, James Gibson pointed out that looking is not a behavior that
*  is limited to just the eyes. It's the eyes and a moving head and a moving body. And anyone who
*  doubts it, you know, just watch your baby, your toddler, your toddler out of the car,
*  out of the high chair, how he, how he looks at things, you know, crouched, you know,
*  whatever. Right. Looking time studies.
*  All right. Looking time studies started in the early 1970s with Robert Sians.
*  Then when people have limited ways of studying babies, so some of the ways that people were
*  studying babies are still really good ways to study babies using operant and classical conditioning.
*  Operant conditioning is an amazing way to study a baby or any other kind of animal. You know why?
*  Because you can make inferences about a single participant. That's why Skinner and a lot of his
*  FEMA studies, BF Skinner only needed one pigeon or one rat because you can say with 100% certainty
*  that you have altered this animal's behavior, you know, based on some reward structure. Right.
*  But fans realize that you could show babies displays and measure how long they look at the
*  display. And that was originally used to ask whether infants could discriminate between
*  different kinds of visual displays. And that's a totally good question.
*  And the technologies they have for doing it were pretty limited, you know, so it started with just
*  an observer peering down at a baby lying on its back and the baby's looking at displays or has
*  the opportunity to look at displays and the observer just pressed a button saying did the
*  baby look at the left display or the display on the right or the display on the left like that.
*  And we're essentially doing the same thing in looking time studies.
*  Only now the questions aren't about discriminating visual displays, the questions are about cognition.
*  So if an infant looks longer at a display, it means that they were surprised or the display was
*  unexpected or whatever. And I think for normal people listening to this, when they hear that a
*  baby's surprised, they think the baby's saying like, or something's happening besides on average,
*  a group of babies looked like that a little bit longer at one display than another, a few seconds
*  longer. That's the data. And typically, it's not even in terms of the proportion of babies that
*  look longer at the whatever display. And I've done those kind of studies. I mean, everyone in
*  infancy research has done those kind of studies. And everyone knows that it all depends on what the
*  display is if you want babies to look at it. And so huge file drawer problem. And I don't even know
*  a way to get around it. Like you're trying to design your experiment, you have to play around
*  with what the displays should look like. And then finally you get, you know, displays that it seems
*  like the babies are interested in and you test them like that. This is not eye tracking. Eye tracking
*  is a new technology that became widely available in the what 2000s and by 2010, any lab will be
*  doing this. And that's where you actually track where the baby is looking on the display, not did
*  the baby look left or look right or look away, but where on the display. So was the baby actually
*  looking at the thing that you the adult researcher thought was the surprise. Now you could actually
*  know. So I don't think there's any excuse for using old fashioned looking time measures when
*  if you want to hit your outcome measure to be based on where babies look, eye tracking and find out
*  where they look, because you'll find really interesting things. There's a beautiful paper by
*  Scott Johnson from I think 2004, we showed that on average babies look longer at
*  look longer at a display where an object appears, you know, to be moving behind an occluder like that.
*  Turns out some of the babies are when you actually use eye tracking and get the location of their
*  looks, some of the babies are tracking the moving object. Some of the babies though, are looking at
*  the edges of the screen or they're looking at the occluder. They don't they don't know how to
*  guide their visual exploration. And the babies that have learned more about how to plan their
*  visual exploration, those babies also perform better, you know, in the straight up habituation
*  test, but they also perform better in a whole range of other tasks. So I just think like,
*  why are we using a really weak tool, method, procedure, when we have all kinds of other
*  things available to us? And
*  but it's still quite prevalent. It's quite prevalent. I would say it's probably the most
*  what's still the most common way to study infant cognition. And among the most widely
*  looking time methods are among the most widely used methods in all of infancy research.
*  And there's, there's just no excuse for it. I mean, if you want to know if the baby's surprised,
*  you could also be looking at their facial expressions and gestures and vocalizations and
*  people, you know, dilation and lots of other things that are all there in the videos.
*  People don't out of laziness, and also because it often doesn't have anything to do with how long
*  they're looking, which argues against it being a surprising event for the baby.
*  So I was telling you a little bit about my background. And what I didn't say is that I
*  came, my PhD was in an eye movement slash neurophysiology lab. And back in the old days,
*  this is non human primate. And it's still done this way frequently as well. But you would do eye
*  tracking, but you would, you would want your experimental setup to be as controlled as
*  possible, right? So we would, you know, head fix the monkeys, they'd be sitting in a chair,
*  because we don't want their head moving, because we want just their eyes moving, so we can track
*  it. And then first something about the, in my case, about the way that they were making decisions
*  with their eyes, right? These days is very different. I'm working with a data set now.
*  So naturalistic behavior is all the rage now. And that's a lot what you do, you do,
*  do controlled experiments, but, but you also just measure naturalistic baby,
*  child developmental behavior in the lab, and you set up the lab to make it, you know, to
*  I want to come back to that. But I want to hear I want to come back to a discussion about naturalistic,
*  natural, whatever unnatural setups, but I want to hear the rest of your story first.
*  Where was I? Oh, I'm doing now. Yeah, I mean, I move once. Right. Well, so I don't do that anymore.
*  So that that is that contrasts with these days, naturalistic, naturalistic behavior has kind of
*  exploded. But yeah, I mean, what you want me to tell you my, my dissertation, is that what you're
*  asking? I wanted to hear that. What? I didn't want to interrupt you. No, that's okay. So these days,
*  I have a I have a challenge, a problem, a challenge, let's go optimistic. So I came to this
*  lab where I'm doing another postdoc, the Eric Eric entry lab. And you know, we have these really high
*  density neural recordings, and freely behaving mice. They're just walking around the cage or a box,
*  in my case, in my data set case, grooming, locomoting, investigating. So it's, you know,
*  when you were talking about earlier, how you can watch a child and say, Oh, that's a locomotion,
*  that's a locomotion, that's a step, that's a locomotion. Well, we have already when I got to
*  the lab, they had developed an unsupervised learning technique to basically use the kinematics
*  data to categorize different behaviors. So I have like all these behavior labels,
*  I have a bunch of neural data. And the question is, how is how is the brain enacting these
*  behaviors? And it's kind of the wild west west right now in neuroscience for naturalistic behavior.
*  Because we have all this data. Now we have all these machine learning techniques.
*  And the whole history of neuroscience, like my PhD, experimental setup is just do the same thing
*  over and over and over, exactly the same way, control it as much as possible, then you average
*  all the same behaviors and compare them to some other behavioral condition. And then you say,
*  Oh, there's a difference that that must be how the brain is doing it. Now, we have a freely behaving
*  mouse who sometimes grooms like this, sometimes like this, you know, sometimes it walks a
*  slightly different way slightly turns left, you know, there are all these like minutia
*  of the behaviors. And the neural activity is not nearly as clean, at least in the areas
*  where I'm recording. And this is actually where I wanted to bring up a piece that you and I didn't
*  know he was your partner wrote about developing motor cortex was part one of my pet little,
*  it's not a theory, because it's not strong enough to be a theory, but thoughts is that
*  the areas that we're recording in, which are primary motor cortex, and basal ganglia,
*  probably aren't needed for these innate naturalistic type behaviors, because there's no
*  motivation. There's no reward. There's no attention. You know, there's no like,
*  there's nothing going on. And I'm not sure I have to interrupt you because now you're getting
*  annoying. So
*  um, awesome. All right, so
*  except for in the beginning of graduate school, where I learned to do looking time studies with
*  babies, you know, strapped in a car seat. I've only done studies where the baby, the child,
*  whatever was free to just continuously do something, some kind of behaviors that were new,
*  new to them new to us, surprising to all. So, you know, you mentioned our study of,
*  you know, four or five year olds hammering a peg.
*  You know, like we saw children do things in hammering the peg that no one would ever
*  have imagined that a child would do. A hundred, whatever, tiny little taps to hammer the peg down.
*  Children using their chest and their bodies or whatever to turn the hammer handle the right way
*  when, when if they grasped it in an awkward position.
*  Coming like this to grasp it so they would end up in a radial grip rather when all they had to do
*  is just do an underhand grip to get it to get it in the right position. And in infants, you know,
*  locomoting, I mean, even
*  once when my child was a
*  my child's grandma, when my child was a child and we did a science day for their sixth grade class
*  and we just asked the, the, the sixth graders to crawl over, crawl on a straight line down a
*  carpet. And we saw so many types of crawls. It was absolutely amazing, you know, bunny hops and,
*  and children who could crawl with aerial flight phases with all four limbs in the air, like a
*  horse, you know, and they're only going a few yards. So, okay, so that was a long winded way
*  that you'll have to edit down to say that I think it's very important than in any task, the animal
*  person has enough room that they can respond in ways with behaviors that are new to them and new
*  to you. Otherwise, why even do it? Because, you know, you've, you sucked all the lifeblood and the
*  fun out of the enterprise. I just interrupt you there and tell you why the history of
*  neuroscience has done it. I know why they've done it. But really, you know, you don't need to do,
*  you don't need to do it to have sufficient control. And, you know, so I generally use
*  psychophysics, which is, you know, psychophysics and operating conditioning are the two ways where
*  you get the most strong data from a single participant. And where so where your inferences
*  about what that participant is doing or knowing or perceiving or whatever are,
*  are most powerful, and you don't have to rely on group averages, right? Naturalistic to me is like,
*  Oh, it's a weird term too.
*  Like, you know, a freely moving mouse in a cage or Rob Frumke's lab at NYU does these beautiful studies of
*  mouse dams, you know, over over consecutive births of their litters and caring for the
*  pups and so on.
*  You said mouse what's over the consecutive?
*  Litters like giving birth to a litter of pups. Yeah, and then feeding the pups and managing the
*  nest and, you know, you know, and then they have like their second so it's 24 seven mouse recordings.
*  They're in a cage and I guess I would call that naturalistic. And I do similar kinds of things
*  because we want to sometimes have studies where everybody has the same environment with the same
*  objects in the same recording setup, or it's a highly calibrated space that's really conducive
*  to computer vision, etc. I also do natural behavior, where you just go out in the wild with
*  your video camera, and just, it's just people doing what they're what they do, the end. And so
*  it's not natural. It's not a stick anything. It's just actual natural behavior. And so I think that
*  whole continuum is extremely useful from a pretty controlled experiment where you want to do
*  something like psychophysics or operating conditioning, but where the animal still has
*  freedom to do its thing to truly natural behavior and somewhere in the middle is the so called
*  naturalistic where it's a little bit like life. It's you know, whatever. What was the annoying part?
*  Just the usage of the of the term naturalistic. Oh, you're saying that naturalistic behaviors
*  are innate behaviors. Oh, no, I was I didn't mean to conflate the two. But what what I meant by innate,
*  so naturalistic is just in in this sense, just the mouse being able to just wander around on its own
*  accord with its own timing. But the behaviors that it's enacting are innate behaviors that like knows
*  how to groom. It's not performing any task. Right. It's just it's maybe it maybe, you know,
*  innate is the wrong word. So it's not it's not a prescribed task that, you know, an externally
*  directed task. It's just the mouse doing what it wants to do. But do mice learn to groom? Yeah,
*  they do. Yeah. And there's a whole range of experiences that mice have to have for them to
*  be effective at learning when they need to groom themselves. So we need a succinct way to a single
*  term for naturalistic, non innate, some at some point learned, but non task related behavior.
*  Yes, that will be good. That would be fine. Okay. Yeah, we'll come up with something.
*  Yeah, anyway. Anyway, the data is not, you know, perfectly aligned to anything. So our
*  unsupervised learning algorithm says, you know, at some time, temporal scale, like when locomotion
*  started, but this locomotion might have begun with left paw moving forward first, the other one with
*  the right paw. And so we can't. So we're doing a thing where we're aligning like traditional
*  neuroscience aligning the beginnings of a behavior to a specific time point. But the
*  behaviors are enacted somewhat differently. Algorithm isn't perfect, etc. So we have all this data.
*  It's fairly aligned, but there's a lot of variation in it. And it's been a challenge to relate the
*  neural activity to the different, in this case, we have 16 different behavioral categories,
*  relate the neural activity to those behaviors. And one reason may be that cortex is maybe not
*  the major player, maybe not needed, except when it is. And when I came across the opinion piece
*  that you and your partner wrote, or the perspective maybe about how early in development,
*  motor cortex is not motor, it's, it's more sensory. And it takes depending on the organism,
*  it takes, you know, longer or shorter for motor cortex activity to be able to even direct
*  behaviors, because the connections literally aren't there when it's younger. But it is getting like
*  sensory information. So I just thought that was interesting. And I'm not sure if I'll present
*  your perspective in my lab group, because there's a lot of talk about like, well, motor cortex must
*  be doing these. So how is it doing it? But maybe it's not doing it. So I wanted to go ahead.
*  I mean, I'm like, I'm getting am I getting annoying again? No, no, well, no, no, no, no.
*  Adults, you know, across the lifespan, we do lots of movements that don't require cortex to control
*  them. The argument in that in that perspective piece is essentially that there is no connections.
*  So the things that, you know, that the researcher is using to make inferences about what's happening
*  in the baby's mind are not coming through cortex. So if you want to say that, you know,
*  whatever month old a seven month older, 15 month old has moral reasoning, you know,
*  three month old has moral reasoning. But it's not the same moral reasoning as an adult would have.
*  So it's like moral, you know, what is it?
*  You know, and that's just sloppy. That's, that's just sloppy science. I let me get Mark and he can.
*  So he's asking about the motor cortex thing. And it's in the context of in his own work,
*  they're studying mouse behavior, freely moving mice behavior in a cage.
*  What I wanted to ask about is, so I have recordings in primary motor cortex and basal ganglia.
*  And I had been thinking this for a while now, that maybe for these less task less motivated, less
*  cortically necessarily driven behaviors, that it's, you know, mostly sub cortical.
*  Whereas the motor cortex, you know, you guys write about how before motor cortex develops
*  the necessary connections to enact skeletal skeletal modal motor behavior, it's actually
*  getting sensory signals, right? And so that would make sense. If motor cortex and or basal ganglia
*  weren't really that important for these behaviors, it would kind of be sloshing around, sometimes
*  delayed a little bit. But my thought is like, well, motor cortex would benefit by being in the right
*  kind of range in case it needs to be called on. You know, but it might not necessarily need to just
*  be like these beautiful tuning curves of neural activity aligned to the to the behaviors.
*  So I just wondered what you think about that. But also I just wanted you to explain a little
*  bit more about that. And then you got some pushback on the perspective, right?
*  Yeah, a little bit.
*  Published pushback anyway.
*  Yes, there's a lot to unpack here, obviously. Because there has been relatively less work done
*  on brainstem circuits, you know, the cortical circuits and the directional behavior,
*  we don't understand fully the relationship between how those things, how they develop,
*  how they are processed in real time, how they lead to the types of time sharing that you see
*  in your behavioral repertoires where they're going from one behavior to another,
*  which is a really complex process. And because mice being mice, everything happens very quickly.
*  So there are questions about how automatic a lot of these things actually are. And so,
*  you know, there's a developing literature in adults about how to learn behavior,
*  motor cortex is more involved in adult behavior, that the motor cortex is involved in that process.
*  So if you lesion the motor cortex prior to learning, you prevent learning. But after
*  certain tasks have been learned, now you destroy motor cortex and there's no effect on the learned
*  response, which leads to the suggestion, which suggests that there's been an offloading of that
*  behavior onto another structure. Not too different from what I think about, you know, systems
*  consolidation of memory where you pass, right? And all of these things are controversial and
*  they all have to be taken, of course, you know, it's easy to solve. But you also asked that about
*  motor cortex being sensory early in development, both evolutionarily and developmentally.
*  The motor cortex is a relatively late evolving structure. You see a lot of overlap in those
*  circuits in certain types of like marsupials, for example. And so the motor cortex is not distinct
*  from sensory cortex in a lot of species. And then developmentally, then what gives credence to that,
*  I think, is when you look developmentally and you see the motor cortex is initially occurring
*  sensory structure. And, you know, my work happens to be involved with looking at how sleep and
*  sleep related motor activity reveals that sensory process. But it's also known that motor cortex in
*  adults is receiving sensory input. There's a nice view by Nick Hatzopoulos in Neuron some years ago
*  called Sensing with Motor Cortex, which doesn't take any developmental perspective
*  at all and still talks about the role that motor cortex plays in processing sensory input. So
*  it's a lifelong process. And it makes sense because motor cortex needs to sort of integrate
*  input and up from proprioceptors and other sorts of, you know, information and then use that to
*  structure motor activity. Can you give the argument in the two papers and then the basic argument?
*  I don't know if we need to talk about pushback. At least give the basic argument. So how can
*  edit that if you want? So the basic argument is that, I gotta report. I gotta get back at it.
*  That picture, like, so, you know, there's the behaviors, reason, make inferences about cognition.
*  Yeah, but let's start with the developmental picture is that, you know, motor cortex,
*  like a lot of other structures like cerebellum, you know, is a very late developing structure.
*  And you can see this, there's some evidence in the human literature, for example,
*  people with cerebral palsy, it's mostly caused by a perinatal stroke. That's one of the most
*  predominant causes of cerebral palsy. But the symptoms don't show themselves until four, six,
*  or later months after birth. Why would that be if motor cortex is so, I mean, you know, we all know
*  that if you have a stroke when you're an adult, you have immediate paralysis that doesn't show up
*  in human infants. But also from cats, rats, developmentally, you see that motor cortex is
*  not, all the evidence that we have suggests that motor cortex is not developing for
*  weeks in the case of rats until after weaning. So that would mean that, and if you look at,
*  you know, you work with mice, if you look at mouse behavior around the time of weaning,
*  it's pretty complicated. You know, they're moving around the cage, they're drinking,
*  they're eating, they're grooming, they're, the evidence would suggest that all that behavior is
*  brainstem dominant. And I said cats and there are cats showing up.
*  That's a dog.
*  Oh, the dog?
*  It's my dog.
*  Okay. Brought to a dog's stance. So the, so where was I?
*  Bring it to the developmental sense.
*  No, I understand. I understand. But the point is that in mice, you know, you're seeing complex
*  behaviors when motor cortex is not involved. I think that has relevance to the work that you're
*  doing. So, so the, the, the, the, the best evidence or one of the best pieces of evidence
*  that you have for demonstrating motor cortex involvement, the sensory stimuli is electrical
*  stimulation of the cortex. And you don't see movement of the limbs and rats until 25 days
*  after birth, which is extraordinary. Right? Now that doesn't mean the circuits are,
*  cannot bring those circuits into reduced behavior. It's just that without a lot of
*  manipulation of those circuits, you don't see evidence of movement. So that's pretty
*  strong evidence. So if you take the, then you go back to the human, you know, the human literature
*  and, and all of the things that are being put into the minds of babies,
*  which whether stated or unstated, you know, whether implicit or explicit,
*  people think of as cortically required, you know, cognitive processes, then, then the inference,
*  the clear inference would be that a lot of these behaviors either are not being controlled by the
*  court, by the, by the cortex or, or, or some of these statements, some of these experiments are
*  either not well done or they're, they're based upon flimsy research or, you know, flimsy methods
*  or what have you. And at least, and there are incorrect instances being drawn about what's
*  either way. So in the best case, assuming the data are real and reliable,
*  not, not motor, you know, not motor cortex driving those looking times, not motor cortex
*  driving the neonatal imitation, not motor cortex driving the behaviors. And that means that it's not,
*  it's not the same underlying representations as in an adult. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Um, what, what does this say about, so at some point motor cortex got the name motor cortex
*  and now we, now it's, we can't, what does this say about how naming something affects the way that we
*  assign function to it? Well, yeah, naming things, I mean,
*  I mean, science is filled with problems with that. Look at the, I mean, you can make the same
*  arguments about genes. Genes, you know, you have a gene, you call it sleepless because of mutant
*  mouse, you know, the mutant fly happens to not sleep, you know, but, but obviously these things
*  are not doing just those things that, that, so motor cortex has that name, but it also does a
*  lot of sense of processing. So yes, it's a problem for how we make it. It's yet another example
*  of how we're getting away. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you named something, it reifies it for sure.
*  Let me just ask you, Karen, one more thing. So thanks for, I guess,
*  Zoom bombing our, oh no, I was going to say thank you for, for solidifying my thought about
*  why am I, why I'm studying something that I, that doesn't exist. That's terrible.
*  But I'll get there. I'll publish something. Cause I have to publish something, you know.
*  So what I want to ask you about Karen is what you're excited about these days. I know you just
*  submitted like 15 grants or something. And it was like, I think it was four grants that you're,
*  you'll be submitting in August, I think you said. And, and so you're going to continue to be
*  prolific and busy. Anything that is particularly exciting and, or challenging. Well, I don't know
*  if I can prioritize. So I just have to tell you the things that I think are, are super exciting.
*  Great. So one thing that's really exciting is collecting corpora
*  of what people's natural behaviors really are. And so we have done that
*  out the wazoo for families in New York City. We're also doing it with the help of 73
*  PIs across the U S and Canada for, um, um, infants and their caregivers across 35 sites
*  in the U S and now we're taking it global. And so imagine you or, you know, any, any researcher
*  being able to access data, bury and see what life was like for babies and their caregivers anywhere
*  in the world during not naturalistic natural, you know, we call it the acronym is babies,
*  B A B I E S and it stands for babies activities and behaviors in everyday settings.
*  I don't know how hard you've worked on that acronym, but I know. Yeah. Good work.
*  Karen. Good work. So that's something that I'm really excited about. Um, and something that
*  would only be possible with, um, a resource and a platform and a tool like data, very,
*  I guess the honest answer though of what I'm really, really excited about are the same things
*  that have excited me since I was a graduate student with Eleanor Gibson. I want to know
*  how babies learn to guide their actions from eyes to toes, um, in an adaptive and functional
*  way to do the things that they need to do and the things they want to do.
*  The things they want to do. How long, how long was it going to take you to figure out five more
*  years? Well, I'm old, so I figure I'm giving myself 10 years to do it. And I think that,
*  so currently one way we're doing that is see babies, we study them solving these problems
*  on apparatuses, deciding how high of a drop off they can walk over, how steep of a slope they
*  can walk up or walk down, et cetera. But then the same babies, we also observe naturalistically
*  in our laboratory playroom where we can see how much they move and how they move and whatever,
*  while they're playing alone and while they're playing with their caregiver. And the same babies
*  during totally natural behavior in their homes, um, for one hour, you know,
*  concerted activity between naps and meals, et cetera. And then also using video ecological
*  momentary assessment where the caregivers take little 10 second videos throughout the day over
*  the course of a week. Um, and then we have standard measures of walking skill, natural walking,
*  body dimensions, you know, the whole, the whole enchilada. Um,
*  and so we'll study that, but we're also now gonna turn that into something where we can ask it in
*  terms of simulated robot learning curricula. And then there you can, you can sort of redo the
*  baby's lives. So does it really matter if a baby steps on 179 different surfaces in the course of
*  an hour? Maybe, but maybe it doesn't really matter for perceiving affordances. Does it really matter
*  if, you know, a baby has experience on elevations for being able to cope with, navigate, perceive
*  affordances of elevations, not, you know, novel elevations in the lab? Maybe, but maybe it doesn't.
*  And we can address those things with simulated robots. Um, your question, does it matter that
*  the body is changing and does that aspect of embodiment really matter? Well, we've tracked
*  babies longitudinally, you know, from two months to about 20 months in the same lab room where at
*  first they just lie on their back and stare at the ceiling and by the end they're running and
*  touching everything in the room and using computer vision so that we know everything that was in
*  their field of view and how that changed everything they touched with their hands and the exact
*  location they touched in and the exact durations, everything, everywhere their body went. So I think
*  those kinds of approaches, um, it's big data, but it's also deep data. And I think that's the way to
*  do it. And I think we've got to put a lot of different minds on it. So if I were all alone,
*  I'd be looking at my videos with the sound off, but luckily I have Catherine Thomas-Lamond,
*  the world's best collaborator, who's an expert in language and social interaction. Um, I think if I
*  were limited to what I could study solely on my own, you know, I'd be looking at babies in New York
*  City living in apartments rather than, you know, out in West Lafayette, Indiana or whatever with
*  my collaborator Laura Claxton. So, you know, and, and we'd all be studying babies that live in
*  things we recognize as a home and not, and things that we go like, really? That's what a home looks
*  like? Another place in the world. Um, so I guess that's a long way to say, let me say,
*  you need to do the whole enchilada Paul. You need to have the controlled experiments. They're highly
*  enough controlled so that you can actually do something like psychophysics and say something
*  definitive about each baby and each session, each participant in each session, just like visual
*  psychophysics, right? But where they're free to do things that'll surprise you and, and horrify you
*  and delay you and, and same with them, right? And you need to know what is the, the actual learning
*  input, which things matter, which things might not matter and, and how that changes with
*  development. And we actually, right now we as a field, because if Keir Ninoff can do it, anyone
*  can do it. We have all the tools and technology to do the whole enchilada. And we have the
*  to do the whole enchilada. And so what my colleagues are still doing babies in a car seat,
*  looking at computer displays and taking group averages, grow up, get a life, you know, like we
*  have the technology, like the $6 million man. We have the tools and technology to do it.
*  Will you do me a favor when, when in 10 years you've figured this all out, will you title the, um,
*  oh my gosh, I think it's my microphone working. You can hear me. Will you title the paper,
*  the whole enchilada? You got it baby. Yeah. It's a great phrase that doesn't get used enough anymore.
*  Karen, thank you so much for your time. And tell Mark I said thank you for
*  coming in. That was a surprise and it was fun. All right.
