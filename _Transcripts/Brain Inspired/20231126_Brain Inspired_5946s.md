# BI 179 Laura Gradowski: Include the Fringe with Pluralism
**Brain Inspired:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCEP5LmSQv8)
*  Fringe theories, I understand as being views that aren't taken very seriously amongst
*  professional scientists.
*  The idea with using a pluralist approach is not just to like, you know, be covering all
*  our bases and, you know, make sure we're including the theory that ends up being the one true
*  theory.
*  The idea is that pluralism is permanent.
*  You know, I get a lot of pushback, but mostly from people who are like on board with the
*  general idea.
*  Like what I get pushback on is like, kind of things you were giving me some pushback
*  on.
*  Like really, we should include everyone.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  I'm Paul Middlebrooks, and I am less of a pluralist than my guest today, Laura Grodowski.
*  Laura is a philosopher of science at the University of Pittsburgh.
*  Pluralism or scientific pluralism anyway, is roughly the idea that there is no unified
*  account of any scientific field and that we should be tolerant of and welcome a variety
*  of theoretical and conceptual frameworks and methods and goals when doing science.
*  Pluralism is kind of a buzzword right now in my little neuroscience slash philosophy
*  world, but it's an old and well-trodden notion.
*  Many philosophers have been calling for pluralism for many years.
*  But how pluralistic should we be in our studies and explanations in science?
*  Laura suggests we should be very, very, very pluralistic.
*  In the episode, I call it extreme pluralism or maybe radical pluralism.
*  To make her case, she cites examples in the history of science of theories and theorists
*  that were once considered quote unquote fringe, but went on to become mainstream accepted
*  theoretical frameworks and theorists.
*  So I thought it would be fun to have her on to share her ideas about fringe theories,
*  mainstream theories, pluralism, etc.
*  So even though this podcast is about neuroscience and AI and intelligence and all that jazz,
*  we discuss a wide range of topics, but we also do discuss some specific to the brain
*  and mind sciences.
*  So for example, Laura describes the trials and tribulations of something and someone
*  that went from fringe to mainstream science, namely the Garcia effect, named after John
*  Garcia, whose findings went against the grain of behaviorism, which was a dominant dogma
*  of the day in psychology back 50, 60, 70 years ago.
*  But this overturning going from fringe to mainstream only happened after Garcia had
*  to endure a long scientific hell of his results being ignored and shunned.
*  So there are multiple examples like that and we discuss a handful.
*  And this has led Laura to the conclusion that we should accept almost all theoretical frameworks.
*  When we discuss her ideas about how to implement this, where to draw the line, and much more.
*  So my thanks to Laura for hanging in there and taking my probably annoying questions
*  every once in a while.
*  Thank you for listening and or watching.
*  I link to Laura's information in the show notes at braininspired.co.uk slash podcast
*  slash 179 179.
*  And thanks as always to those of you who support this podcast on Patreon.
*  As some of you know who've recently approached me when I've been at a conference to moderate
*  a panel, etc.
*  I feel so much appreciation for your support and your kind words that I get chills when
*  I meet you guys.
*  And so I look forward to meeting more of you in the future and appreciate your support.
*  All right, here's Laura.
*  Where should we start?
*  There's so many different places we could start.
*  Just the word fringe.
*  Is fringe a technical term?
*  So.
*  Or are you making it into a technical term?
*  I'm perhaps making it into a technical term.
*  But I'm trying to capture the way that we use it naturally.
*  Okay, yeah, I wonder how much of our conversation today is going to be about how we use words.
*  And so I mean, I'm so naive, so ignorant of philosophy, I guess that I thought, well,
*  maybe fringe is a technical term, but I never looked it up.
*  So what to you is fringe?
*  And how did you come to be interested in studying the fringe in science?
*  Yeah, great questions.
*  So fringe theories, as well, I talk about fringe theories and fringe science, but fringe
*  theories specifically are just alternative views.
*  The way I used to define it was like very simply as just like this broad set of alternative
*  views that go against what the consensus is amongst professional scientists.
*  So the trouble with that is like figuring out what consensus is.
*  And on top of that, too, there's mainstream views that you might say are not consensus
*  views.
*  Okay, because in your dissertation, you it's kind of a battle between fringe and mainstream.
*  That's how I kind of hit it in my own mind.
*  I'm not sure if that was intentional.
*  But consensus is a new one now for me.
*  So keep arranging that for me, because I thought you're going to talk about fringe versus mainstream.
*  Yeah, I mean, that is the distinction.
*  So I mean, the way I see it now is as like on a continuum.
*  So with fringe at one end and mainstream at the other end.
*  And where's consensus?
*  And sorry to interrupt.
*  So consensus isn't consensus probably somewhere over in the mainstream area.
*  Okay.
*  It's along that same continuum.
*  It's not a multi-dimensional.
*  It would be multi-dimensional.
*  So consensus would be since there are mainstream views that are not consensus views, you can't
*  just say mainstream.
*  You can't define mainstream theories as the views about which professional scientists
*  have consensus.
*  I mean, perhaps there could be like consensus about what mainstream views are.
*  But that's another thing.
*  So yeah, and so defining it along a continuum allows for borderline cases.
*  And it allows me to like talk about super fringe and super mainstream.
*  That's more tentative.
*  But so fringe theories, I understand as being views that aren't taken very seriously amongst
*  professional scientists.
*  So one measure for that is, I call it like the sociological measure, which is a theory's
*  degree of absence in the relevant disciplines, peer-reviewed journals or other forums for
*  discourse.
*  Okay.
*  So there's like levels of fringe, right?
*  You don't have to go all the way to totally absent for a theory to count as fringe.
*  But then you have to take into consideration the relevant power of the publications, right?
*  If you're going to quantify something, and maybe we can get in later to how to and whether
*  to quantify fringe, but you're already kind of talking about that.
*  So there's just so many different dimensions to how you would quantify fringe, I guess.
*  So you just mentioned the relevant publications, but how do you even define that?
*  And then do you have to like score them and take a weighted average sort of thing?
*  We know what journals are, like the top tier journals in a given discipline, right?
*  So I think we already have ideas for what would count.
*  But specifically, I think journals published with academic presses would be like where
*  to look.
*  Not zines, not the old zines.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  I mean, I think like being published in scientific, like a theory being published in Scientific
*  American, for example, would be pretty indicative that it was mainstream.
*  Or at least on its way to mainstream.
*  How does one, like did someone introduce you to the term fringe or the idea of fringe?
*  Or was this on your radar beforehand?
*  Or was this floating around in philosophy before?
*  Like how did it come about?
*  So certainly not floating around in philosophy.
*  And you know, I mean, not really in any scientific field.
*  I mean, here and there, like I did like heavy searches for the use of the term fringe in
*  philosophy papers.
*  Found like a few uses here and there.
*  There are some papers like from sort of back in the day, like, I don't know, 1970s talking
*  about what fringe theories are, which is really cool.
*  But all that has been like sort of lost and forgotten, at least in philosophy.
*  So I mean, nobody told me to work on it.
*  It's sort of what I picked up was really relevant amongst sort of like, I guess in pop culture
*  right now, people are talking a lot about the mainstream theories saying this and fringe
*  theories saying that.
*  I think people are really interested in fringe theories.
*  And I guess nobody has done this project of like looking at which fringe theories, or
*  I mean, even like really will admit that fringe theories become mainstream.
*  So I went around like asking some philosophers what they thought about this idea.
*  I trouble getting people, like convincing people at first to like be my advisor on this
*  project.
*  But ultimately did.
*  Good old John Greenwood from CUNY was supportive.
*  I mean, it's juicy.
*  The topic is it's it's topical, right, with the recent, you know, with disinformation
*  campaigns and what's what's a truth, what's a fact, what's a fact, postmodernism, etc.
*  So it's a juicy topic, right?
*  Yeah, totally.
*  Yeah, we're like in this age of misinformation, right.
*  Or and a lot of fringe theories are, I mean, dismissed as just being misinformation.
*  Let's talk about some of the characteristics.
*  I'll ask you about some examples.
*  People are probably wondering like what what are they talking about?
*  No, like what?
*  Give me some examples.
*  But before we do that, like what are some characteristics that that qualify a theory
*  and or a science as quote unquote fringe?
*  Good.
*  Yeah.
*  I talked about the sort of sociological measure that you can use.
*  So just general absence in academic forums for discourse.
*  And I think it's important to recognize too that a theory can be fringe relative to like
*  one discipline, but not to another discipline or more fringe relative to one discipline
*  than another.
*  What's an example of that?
*  I guess I'm thinking of Continental Drift, which was not fringe to people studying like
*  fossil records and like paleontology, but was very fringe to geologists who were just
*  very certain that the continents could not do something like move.
*  So I mean, you can be absent from geology journals without being absent from paleontology
*  journals.
*  Okay.
*  Right.
*  But I mean, in general, like Continental Drift during its period on the fringe was like completely
*  absent from nature, for example, like not a single not even like criticisms.
*  Like okay, so there's not even you don't even get like it's just like so obviously wrong
*  that it's not worth bringing up.
*  It's not even worth bringing up in this context.
*  And you know, you get a lot of like ridicule and things like that.
*  I think like what makes a theory like super fringe is when it's like taboo to academics,
*  you know, and this sort of it can be captured with the sociological thing.
*  But then there's also like epistemic features.
*  So one big thing is that fringe theories foreground anomalies.
*  So they basically look at what's anomalous to say the going theory, theories or whatever.
*  I mean, there's consensus views and then there's mainstream views, which some of which are
*  consensus views, right?
*  But so they look for, you know, what is the mainstream theory not capturing?
*  I mean, in some cases, the anomalies kind of just like go beyond mainstream theory.
*  Like you get UFOs.
*  But the idea is that with anomalies, you have to either you can either like dismiss them,
*  sort of brush them under the rug or say we'll deal with this later or some other field should
*  deal with this.
*  But with fringe theories, you get them positively appraising them.
*  So saying this is a real problem.
*  And the upshot of that is having to like reinterpret the data surrounding the anomaly.
*  And that leads to like a theory revision or theory change.
*  But is it the case that an anomaly will encourage someone to develop a fringe theory?
*  Or is it the case that someone has their own theory and then the anomaly, according to
*  some other theory frame theoretical framework pops out at them?
*  I would imagine one could kind of look at a theory and say I'm going to find some anomalies
*  and then that'll help generate a alternative theory.
*  Yeah, I think that's definitely possible.
*  I mean, I guess you don't this might not be a necessary feature and also certainly not
*  sufficient.
*  Mainstream theories too can be really taking anomalies seriously.
*  But it is very, very common feature.
*  So yeah, I mean, I could see somebody reinterpreting all the same data that a mainstream theory
*  interprets, right, but without focusing on any particular anomaly.
*  So I read your dissertation and I've seen a couple talks that you've given.
*  And I hadn't realized, so I saw your talk and you talk about the Garcia effect.
*  Since this is a neuroscience kind of artificial intelligence, more neuroscience podcast,
*  the Garcia effect like stood out to me as one of the major cases that you cite as having
*  been a fringe theory that then became mainstream and you kind of document the relative hell
*  that Garcia had to go through.
*  And you know, well, I'll just ask you to maybe tell that story to people as a concrete example.
*  Yeah, cool.
*  So yeah, what Garcia, I mean, he's working at the Naval Radiological Defense Lab in California.
*  And he was studying the effects of radiation on the rat brain.
*  And in doing that, he just he sort of realized that the rats in the radiation chambers started
*  to avoid their water.
*  And he hypothesized that that had to do with them associating the taste of the water with
*  the radiation.
*  And so I mean, the going theory at this time was like behaviorist ideas like Skinner and
*  so on, which, you know, thought that behaviors could be conditioned.
*  But in order to condition behavior, in order to learn a new behavior, the two associated
*  events have to be contiguous in time and place.
*  So one after another and repeated.
*  And another tenant here was that all stimuli have equal potential to become conditioned
*  in the behaviorism playbook.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So Garcia did this study with he did he did a couple of studies in the 50s, 1950, 1957,
*  showing that you could condition with a long delay.
*  So you didn't need the two events to be contiguous.
*  So radiation and the sweet they use like saccharin.
*  So sweet water.
*  The rats started avoiding the sweet water in their radiation chambers.
*  Sorry, what was Garcia's first name?
*  John.
*  John Garcia.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, where was I?
*  He had the he had been well, he originally described his experiments.
*  So he hypothesized that the rats were associating the taste of the water with their radiological
*  sickness.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So he tested this.
*  And the thing is, I don't know if you mentioned this, that when you radiate right a mouse,
*  it takes a long time or it takes there's a long delay before it feels any of the illness
*  effects.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So I mean, there were questions too about like, what's the like, whether you should
*  consider the radiation itself or the illness.
*  And I think eventually it was the illness that was coming into the picture.
*  But the stimulus rate was the radiation.
*  So the idea was that rats were associating the effects of the radiation, what they were
*  experiencing as the radiation with the flavor of the water.
*  And this did not fit the stimulus response need to be paired congruently in time very
*  quickly and repeatedly.
*  Yeah.
*  And also it was like a one shot learning, you know, you don't need it to be repeated.
*  Just that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Just don't drink that water.
*  But the first few publications, so at first, John Garcia did not, I'm telling a little
*  bit of your story and just interrupt me because the first few publications that he submitted
*  were essentially accepted.
*  And you argue that that's partly because he interpreted his results by saying that it
*  actually was not incongruent with behaviorism.
*  So he kind of like couched the experiments or tried to make the results of the experiments
*  fit the behavioralist paradigm.
*  But then he started getting into trouble when he started using language that questioned
*  the behaviorist paradigm.
*  Yes, totally.
*  So I mean, originally tried to fit it into the sort of classical conditioning language,
*  and you know, it didn't really generate any citations.
*  Like nobody was paying, just nobody really cared, which is also interesting.
*  I mean, it got into science, you know, so that's a big deal, which, you know, should
*  be right.
*  But then later, like, you know, like, I mean, he was continuing to do studies and, you know,
*  he's publishing on all different kinds of things.
*  He was working on his PhD, eventually, and eventually finished it.
*  And after leaving for a while, after failing a statistics exam, and gives us all hope.
*  It gives us all hope.
*  Yeah.
*  Totally.
*  But then he was shunned.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah, so I mean, he first year shunned, right?
*  And then there's hope.
*  So he around 1966, he published a couple more papers, which really called into question
*  the some of the behaviorist principles.
*  Those three that I mentioned, the stimulus, equipotentiality, the repetition and the contiguity
*  in space and time.
*  And people were not pleased with this.
*  I mean, they did.
*  So those papers did not get into science.
*  He had tried.
*  They also were rejected from the Journal for Comparative Physiology and Psychology, which
*  is like a APA journal.
*  And ended up in a sort of new journal at the time, Psychonomic Science, which was more
*  about measurement than about learning.
*  And didn't have like a whole peer review process.
*  And he ended up publishing like a shorter version of both of those papers in Psychonomic
*  Science because neither of them could get published elsewhere.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the whole story goes on for about 10, 15 years.
*  I mean, he won the APA's Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1980, 1979, some 15
*  years or so.
*  And even during that time, even when he was winning the APA's award, he was still getting
*  journal rejections from APA journals.
*  And I mean, not everybody, not everyone bought it.
*  I think you probably remember me talking about this guy, Bitterman, who was just very resistant
*  to these ideas.
*  And then there's like the famous line of like, oh, those findings from Garcia are no more
*  likely than bird shit in a cuckoo clock.
*  Yeah.
*  Did he quote that in his sort of, he had an acceptance speech slash letter, right?
*  Did he quote it in that?
*  No, it's not from him.
*  Okay.
*  No, no, no.
*  I thought he quoted as someone having criticized him.
*  Yeah.
*  So he goes through all the sort of rejections he got.
*  Yeah.
*  He kept tabs.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  And yeah, so he, I mean, he, I think in a sort of joking way, like he's clearly a little
*  bit, was a little bitter about it.
*  He diagnoses the rejections he got as like neophobia of editorial consultants.
*  And I think the funny thing about that is, is that his theories, his idea that this was
*  conditioned learning that was happening here were rejected as like, oh no, it's just neophobia.
*  Like the rats are just afraid of this new, I don't know, water in this new situation
*  or something.
*  So I mean, there are different interpretations, right?
*  But ultimately, right, his case wins out.
*  And now the effect has his namesake, the Garcia effect.
*  Yeah, the Garcia effect, yeah.
*  And so in sort of the upshot is that there is this scientific effect.
*  I don't know, was it already, was it theory already or it kind of just started with an
*  observation and did he develop a theory?
*  To counter the behaviorist paradigm or was it more like this is an anomaly guys, everybody,
*  everybody?
*  Yeah, so yeah, so I think, yeah, that's definitely something that I thought I thought a bit about,
*  which is that it's not what he's proposing is not really a theory.
*  It's more of a constraint to behaviorist theory or like the imperialism of behaviorism, right?
*  So showing that we don't, you know, it's not only in cases where there's repetition that
*  learning happens and it's not only in cases.
*  And also to the stimulus equipotentiality thing where actually it does matter what the
*  stimulus is.
*  Yeah, and it matters how you're, which senses you're taking it in, right?
*  Yeah, so and there are other people at the time who were working on animal behavior
*  and finding that it was impossible to condition certain types of behaviors.
*  So I think one of the examples I gave was that the Brellins who had this animal behavior
*  enterprises were like trying to condition behaviors in like raccoons and all kinds of
*  animals and they were trying to get a raccoon to put a coin in a piggy bank.
*  Of course.
*  Of course, right?
*  Because yeah, and he instead would just like rub the coin in this like very miserly fashion,
*  I guess in a way that's similar to the way they like rub their food.
*  Like he wouldn't let go of it.
*  But anyway, so I mean the point is that there are other people like in the background kind
*  of contributing to this idea that we could have and like the stimulus matters, right?
*  Not any animal is just going to do anything through conditioning.
*  But are you saying that that is one of the drivers of the Garcia effect becoming more
*  mainstream or being accepted?
*  I think so.
*  I think that contributed.
*  There is also, if I remember correctly, there was also the the quote unquote cognitive revolution
*  that was happening at the same kind of time and behaviorism was being, I'm not going to
*  say I won't say attacked, but overthrown by the cognitive revolution, right?
*  And so that sort of made it more acceptable that these kinds of experiment or results
*  would be interpreted in a more favorable fashion perhaps.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  So I mean, well, some people would deny this.
*  So I talked to some different scientists who were involved in the working on the early
*  replications of the Garcia effect.
*  And some of them say it has nothing to do with the cognitive revolution.
*  Others say, no, it totally did.
*  Like all about it.
*  Shocking.
*  People have different opinions.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, my take is that so a couple of people who were really crucial for helping the Garcia
*  effect gain respectability include like Martin Seligman and Paul Rosin.
*  And I mean, Seligman had this book where Garcia, there were articles like five different papers
*  from Garcia published in it.
*  But at the same time, too, he was coming up with this sort of like computational language
*  for describing cognition and like as having there being these internal states, which was
*  not the behaviorists cup of tea.
*  So and I mean, especially when it comes to animals, I think that was a problem.
*  So I mean, the reason people think, oh, it had nothing to do with the cognitive revolution
*  is because the cognitive revolution was so focused on humans.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  But I definitely think there's some coincidence there.
*  But so like, what are a few of your other go to examples?
*  And you know, you don't have to tell like the full stories, but just to kind of rip
*  off some some theories that began as fringe and are now accepted as mainstream to let
*  people realize that there's more than just a few of these because they're really kind
*  of endless.
*  Yeah.
*  So we've got Magneto reception in birds that was proposed in like 1870s, something like
*  that.
*  And I mean, the sort of anomaly there was that they noticed that young birds were migrating
*  without the help of adults.
*  So the question was, like, how are they doing this?
*  So there were some theories that said, like, the stars were orienting the birds.
*  Anyway, I won't get too much into the details unless you want to ask.
*  But yeah, rip off a few.
*  Yeah, that's yeah.
*  So Magneto reception birds that became mainstream maybe 1950s, 60s, 70s, somewhere in there.
*  And I mean, now in humans, that's there's some research there in the mainstream happening.
*  Is it?
*  Oh, my my understanding of that was that it's still fringe.
*  My reading is definitely still fringe.
*  Definitely still fringe.
*  But people I mean, there's a guy at Stanford who's working on it and has shown that, you
*  know, they're the human brain responds to changing magnetic fields.
*  Anyway, so still fringe.
*  Others other examples of theories that were once fringe content drift is like the big
*  one.
*  Yeah.
*  Are there any of them that are like more amusing to you that that, you know, that you think
*  of as kind of, you know, like, well, I guess kind of drift.
*  And I guess the three you've already listed would be the most amusing to you because you
*  use them extensively.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, so there's a bunch of other ones.
*  I mean, there are dozens.
*  So there's a few examples from traditional ecological knowledge, theories that were just
*  thought to be, you know, sort of like spiritual mythology that later turned out to be true.
*  So one example is olfaction in Wales.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  The enuits, eskimos at the time, enuits.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not sure what we're supposed to call them.
*  Yeah.
*  Arctic and subarctic Inuit peoples found that they had to put out their fires on land in
*  order to hunt for the whales.
*  And I mean, the reason people thought this couldn't be is that toothed whales don't have
*  an olfactory system.
*  But it turns out that like baleen bullhead whales have quite the olfactory system.
*  And yeah, so that, I mean, that theory was around for, I mean, probably thousands of
*  years.
*  But I mean, dismissed probably for less, a shorter period than that.
*  But ultimately, one out, there's also firebirds, which drop.
*  Yeah, go ahead.
*  I thought you were going to talk about them without explaining what they are because I
*  know there was a car for instance.
*  Yeah.
*  So firebirds are falcons or kites who drop burning sticks on unburned areas of forests.
*  And this is thought to be like, I mean, it's part of creation kind of story.
*  But of course, people in the mainstream are like, that's crazy.
*  Why would a bird do that?
*  And I mean, really recently, I think it's 2017, they found that, yes, there are birds
*  that drop burning sticks on unburned areas of forests.
*  And the idea is to get all the insects and little rodents and stuff out of the forest
*  so that they're easier to catch.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's a good idea.
*  It's a great idea.
*  Yeah.
*  If you like to eat that sort of thing.
*  So one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on after learning more about your work
*  is because neuroscience and I'll just say that the studies of intelligence, right, artificial
*  intelligence, natural intelligence is still a very new field.
*  And as you I'm sure are aware, there are about 6,000 different theories about consciousness,
*  for example.
*  And recently, I've had on multiple people who are questioning the, I guess, mainstream
*  or consensus story in neuroscience about memory and how memories are stored, whether it's
*  like through the synapses between neurons or if it's somehow stored intracellularly.
*  And so I started wondering, well, is this fringe, is the intracellular memory story
*  fringe?
*  Because one of the guests is having trouble getting funding, which is a gatekeeping.
*  That's definitely.
*  Yeah, that's definitely.
*  Well, it's a sign.
*  Yeah, it's a sign.
*  It's a sign that it's fringe.
*  Totally.
*  And we didn't talk about this.
*  So I want to come back to consciousness in a minute because I'm sure you have thoughts
*  on like recent goings on about pseudoscience, etc.
*  But backing up again, just to one of the general features of that makes something labeled as
*  fringe is that there is an active suppression, right, of of the ideas in the community, whether
*  it's from editors and so this funding issue, right, that the funding is not provided to
*  this particular person or persons who have these ideas that are not mainstream is kind
*  of an active suppression, silencing, marginalization is the term that you use as well.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if you want to just speak to that.
*  I just wanted to throw that in there.
*  I'm not sure if we mentioned it before, but yeah, that's so I've been having these people
*  on the podcast, these researchers, and of course, I've always been interested in consciousness
*  as all interesting humans are not saying that I'm interesting.
*  But but you know, do you do you have the lay of the land of consciousness theories and
*  what is considered fringe, what is considered mainstream, because there was a recent kerfuffle
*  about one group of people calling another group, not calling them pseudoscience or calling
*  their ideas pseudoscience.
*  I think in that paper, they actually alluded to the idea that integrated information theory
*  has been labeled by someone as potentially pseudoscience.
*  And this caused everyone to say that the authors of the paper were actually calling it pseudoscience.
*  So I don't know, you must have enjoyed following this.
*  So I didn't follow it too closely, mostly what I know about it is hearsay.
*  But I am up on theories of consciousness.
*  I used to Yeah, that used to be by my whole game was consciousness consciousness studies.
*  So yeah, I mean, it's interesting.
*  I mean, at least in philosophy, like panpsychism, for example, is pretty mainstream, I would
*  say it's becoming more mainstream.
*  But there's a lot of I think that there are our passions that become apparent when talking
*  about something like panpsychism, right?
*  Passions?
*  Yeah, people, people's intuitions take over people, you know, like the discarding of an
*  idea as being ridiculous on the surface, for example, that the rock is conscious.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, totally.
*  I mean, at least when it's put that way.
*  I mean, so I guess there's panpsychist views that are, I guess, less wild.
*  Like they don't say rocks are conscious, right?
*  They're more like there's something going on at the level at the lowest level of physics
*  that is generating consciousness at the human level.
*  So I mean, whether that's really panpsychism.
*  Yeah, well, yeah.
*  So panpsychism as like rocks are conscious is definitely fringe.
*  See, we're not supposed to be laughing at this, right?
*  Because, but that's exactly that's exactly the problem.
*  Because your solution is we're part of the problem.
*  Yeah, I'm part of the problem.
*  I know that.
*  But it's entertaining.
*  The problems are entertaining.
*  But but your solution is sort of an extreme pluralism.
*  And maybe we'll come come to that.
*  But so so we'll pause here because let's say the word panpsychism.
*  Well, there are 400 different flavors of panpsychism and the term panpsychism.
*  I'm not sure about its etymology and its history, but presumably it meant one thing at one time.
*  And it's the features, the way that we define panpsychism or any term drifts over time.
*  And I'm wondering how much of the of considering something that used to be fringe and now is
*  mainstream, how much of it or how often can it be the case that what's actually happening
*  is that we're just reinterpreting a term that used to be used one way.
*  And now we're interpreting it a different way.
*  But we use the same word for it.
*  And if that's a fair way to look at it.
*  Totally. I mean, totally.
*  So I think actually, again, Continental Drift is a good case to look at here because
*  Alfred Wagner, who's probably the most famous for proposing continental displacement,
*  had this sort of astronomical mechanism for it, which was not something that was accepted by,
*  ever accepted by mainstream geology.
*  And so, I mean, it did it did change significantly from the time Alfred Wagner proposed it to
*  the time it was accepted some half a century later.
*  What didn't change is that the continents move.
*  OK. Right.
*  And I think that's what's important.
*  I think and I think you'll see this in a lot of cases of fringe theories where it's like
*  they're not necessarily like mature theories in the sense of like have it all worked out.
*  Right.
*  So a lot of them are lacking a mechanism to explain how they work.
*  So they'll often invoke like sort of what seems like magical ideas to explain something.
*  Where you see this in like parapsychology.
*  And I think like seeing that as a problem is a problem.
*  So rather than recognizing that that's a feature of theories that are just, you know,
*  coming to the coming into the game.
*  And so, yeah, so I mean, not everything will stay the same about a theory when it moves from
*  fringe to mainstream. Right.
*  Certainly a lot of the original features are lost.
*  But I think the what's relevant here is that like the core idea like in continental drift,
*  this idea that the continents can change their positions and break apart over time.
*  Right. Is that still true?
*  Has the term continent been consistent over time?
*  What we mean by when we say continent, I mean, you know, there are just these issues like.
*  So when people debate the word intelligence, for example, or consciousness, I would say,
*  I would guess 90 percent of the time they're talking past each other because they're just
*  they have different conceptual frameworks regarding the terms that they're using.
*  Right. And the way that they approach it.
*  You write about theory, ladeness and a bunch of that stuff in the.
*  And so we don't have to get deep in the commensurability, et cetera.
*  But but I just wonder, you know, how much.
*  So when a fringe theory becomes mainstream, you're saying that the cluster of features
*  of the theory can change as it as it becomes mainstream.
*  So it's not like it just here's a theory.
*  People thought it was bad.
*  Now it's become mainstream and people think it's good.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, I mean, if you think about these cases that I brought up
*  from traditional ecological knowledge, right, you don't get the whole spiritual mythology
*  story along with firebirds. Right.
*  And yeah, I mean, so.
*  But I think the core of the theory is what is becoming mainstream in these cases.
*  So I mentioned pseudoscience, the term pseudoscience.
*  And I mentioned it in in talking about this recent paper that was signed like by a bunch of
*  consciousness researchers and the label was applied to integrated information theory,
*  which is a burgeoning and mainstream, I would say, approach to consciousness these days.
*  But the term pseudoscience is a real insult these days.
*  And so what what makes something count as pseudoscience?
*  Great question. So the way I understand pseudoscience is
*  someone is doing pseudoscience if they're pretending to do science, but don't really believe they are.
*  Right. So rarely are you going to get somebody who is being dismissed as a pseudoscientist
*  accepting that title. Right.
*  Most people who are doing pseudoscience believe they're doing science.
*  They don't believe they're faking it. Right.
*  So, I mean, I see pseudoscience really as just a term of abuse and almost vulgar should be a curse word.
*  But I mean, in the sense of like, oh, you're just like faking it. Right.
*  But really, what we what the way it functions is just to silence.
*  At I mean, at least the sort of consensus in philosophy is that there's not really much meaning to the term.
*  Oh, because it's like the worst kind of burn you can give to a scientist.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Yeah.
*  And it yeah. I mean, as soon as the theory is dismissed as pseudoscience, it has negative consequences for that theory.
*  So I think that's probably part of what underlies that whole debate about integrated information theory.
*  That whole thing was like over overplayed, overdone.
*  But that's what social media also does these days. And let's not talk about social media.
*  OK, so we have let's say we have a fringe theory.
*  What I want to know is how does a fringe theory become mainstream?
*  Right. Because it's kind of like the fringe theory is the underdog.
*  And you're kind of rooting for the underdog if it has the potential to become,
*  quote unquote, mainstream, because mainstream means you've somehow succeeded in promoting your theory from fringe to mainstream.
*  So like, what are the qualities of fringe theories?
*  Is there a way to tell what a promising fringe theory is that it's you know, has the promise to become mainstream?
*  Are there features that you can point to?
*  So, I mean, I know all of my cases are like of fringe theories becoming mainstream.
*  And this is supposed to convince people that mainstream status means that a theory is true.
*  But just equally, mainstream theories do not stay mainstream.
*  Right. So measuring a theory's success in terms of its mainstream status seems like a bit of a problem.
*  But that is the way I mean, that is that is what convinces people, right, is that, you know,
*  scientists have taken it up, so it must be legitimate.
*  But you don't have like, so I kind of read into your work that you're kind of rooting for the fringe theories to have an equal footing at the table.
*  So that then kind of dissolving the term fringe, right, so that everything is kind of mainstream.
*  But to put it on, but that's assuming that mainstream is good.
*  Right. So let's say a theory goes from fringe to mainstream.
*  And now what happens to it?
*  You know, now that it's mainstream, now you have other fringes competing with with it as the mainstream winner.
*  Right. Totally. Yeah.
*  I mean, that's definitely true.
*  So what I think. I mean, some promising like something that might indicate that a theory is has potential to become mainstream is just it's people resisting it, like paying attention to it in any way.
*  Right. So people putting energy into debunking a theory is indicative that that theory somehow threatens the mainstream theory right enough to actually say something about it.
*  As opposed to, let's say, because I was going to ask.
*  So as a scientist, I'm kind of indifferent to some theories.
*  Right. So I don't need to actively suppress anything.
*  I'm just I just it's not in my worldview and it doesn't affect me.
*  And I don't care. Is that super fringe for me?
*  Is indifference worse than debunked trying to debunk?
*  Whereas, you know, no, I think indifference is totally normal.
*  And like what super fringe is when it's like we can't talk about it because it's so taboo.
*  Yeah, it's or like, at least if we talk about it, we're going to be like telling a joke.
*  Right. Oh, aliens.
*  Yeah, that's the best kind of fringe.
*  Yeah, it is. It's fun.
*  Yeah. So, yeah, maybe we shouldn't be having so much fun with some of these theories.
*  No, it's supposed to be fun.
*  So, yeah, we should be having fun, but not in a derogatory way.
*  Yeah, I didn't think about this as like now people are going to lose their like joke database.
*  Yeah, that's that's kind of precious, actually.
*  Yeah. So, you know, you write about Thomas Kuhn and Karl Popper about how science goes and sort of the Kuhnian scientific progress,
*  the Popperian scientific progress.
*  And Kuhn writes about, you know, scientific norms and how they kind of eventually get overthrown over the course of a, quote, scientific revolution.
*  Is that one of the characteristics of fringe theories is that they're sort of pre.
*  What is the word that Kuhn uses? Preparadigmatic?
*  Yeah, preparadigm. Yeah.
*  So great question. And totally that is something that we see with fringe theories is that they sort of defy the methodological and procedural norms that we tend to value in science.
*  So things like internal consistency of a theory, but also consistency with established theories.
*  So with like, ufology, you get theories there that ufology, the study of UFOs, I should just clarify.
*  Yes, that, you know, sort of defy the laws of physics, which, you know, that's not being consistent with established theories.
*  Other things like include like lacking a mechanism, which I mentioned.
*  If you don't propose a mechanism, like if your theory does not propose a mechanistic account.
*  If there isn't an acceptable mechanism, a mechanism that people will, if it's magic, you know, buy, like if it's magic, that doesn't work.
*  So, yeah, and of course, like when theory is taken up by the mainstream, like a lot of those things, those things go away.
*  But I think just looking at those features, just breaking the norms as like a bad thing is just sort of short sighted, I guess.
*  You know, like we're we shouldn't expect theories on the fringe to be following norms.
*  We shouldn't expect the same norms for theory construction as we expect for theory testing.
*  So the idea was, as I see it, at least with fringe theories, is we're discovering hypotheses to be tested, not testing hypotheses.
*  So lacking evidence and cherry picking and things like that shouldn't really be norms that come into the picture.
*  Let's transition and talk and talk about your solution, your proposed solution, which you don't call extreme pluralism.
*  You just use the term pluralism, but it is maybe extreme is the it's a half is it maybe extreme is too extreme a term.
*  It is a hefty pluralism.
*  What kind of pluralism, what adjective would you put in front of pluralism to describe your brand of pluralism that is aimed at the general public?
*  Pluralism that is aimed at solving the way that we treat fringe theories, essentially.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, extreme extreme works.
*  I would say thorough going, thorough going.
*  OK. Yeah. Aspirational.
*  That's that has a nice ring to it.
*  It sounds kind. Aspirational.
*  That can be that can be your adjective.
*  Extreme is fine.
*  Yeah. Extreme extreme pluralism.
*  I didn't know it was so extreme.
*  So I mean, it's really I guess it's extreme in the sense of I'm everyone is included.
*  Yeah. Describe describe what you think should should happen.
*  So pluralism is what I'm I'm a pluralist about theories.
*  Right. So specifically this idea that we should be using more than one theory to investigate some domain.
*  And those theories need not be mutually consistent.
*  Just differentiate theory and framework for me.
*  And yeah, because a framework I think that a framework comes along with the ride comes along
*  for the ride with a theory. Right.
*  Yeah. So I mean, another I guess theoretical framework is maybe the same as theory.
*  I mean, maybe you get with framework.
*  OK. Theories can be more general.
*  Or more precise.
*  Like there are many theories that make up a single theory, you might say.
*  But yeah, I mean, with theory, too, you get like what methods are OK.
*  Like that's that can be part of theory.
*  So you might might think of this more as like paradigm pluralism.
*  OK. So being able to use like alternative research methods.
*  Right. Alongside the established research methods.
*  Yeah. So right.
*  You can with pluralism.
*  What the ideal is, is to be able to sort of switch between the theories you're using.
*  So investigate the same domain with two different theories.
*  So theories that are not necessarily consistent with one another.
*  And it's sort of like the gestalt switching that happens with the like the Necker cube.
*  Like seeing it this way and then seeing it that way.
*  All right. But it's the same thing you're seeing.
*  As an individual researcher, you're saying you should be able to hold that.
*  Those what is that cognitive dissonance holding to.
*  Yeah. Which is hard.
*  Yeah. Which is hard.
*  But if if your version of pluralism is the way to go, I don't have to hold two theories in mind.
*  I have to hold 600 theories in mind.
*  Right. I have my OK.
*  Thousands about my particular.
*  So I mean, part of what I say about this is that not everybody has to use every theory.
*  Right. I mean, the main thing is to be more tolerant towards alternative theories.
*  But I think people shouldn't do research according to a theory that they are not interested in in any way.
*  I was going to ask you that because we all have our individual interests as well.
*  Totally. Yeah.
*  Just as you wouldn't do research on a topic that you're not interested in,
*  you shouldn't use a theory that you're not.
*  But if I want to claim progress on the topic that I'm interested in,
*  what you're saying is that I damn well better know all of the different viewpoints.
*  Or it would behoove me to know all of the different viewpoints if I want to claim progress.
*  I don't know what you mean by progress, but.
*  Well, I was going to ask you what progress is.
*  So I'm glad you brought that up.
*  Because I think a lot of people are like me in research, at least, in that I often question
*  like what I'm doing can be fun. It can be answering scientific questions, certain ones.
*  But is it really progress? Am I making any progress?
*  And I don't know that I have a good answer to that.
*  I mean, the basic research game is a long game, right?
*  And you can't really predict what kind of, quote unquote, progress
*  or discoveries are going to come from it.
*  So you're often like swimming in this deep ocean,
*  not knowing whether you're actually heading toward shore for a terrible analogy.
*  Sorry. So what is progress, right?
*  If we need to bring fringe to the mainstream or treat everything with tolerance,
*  presumably that's because you think that different perspective, different theoretical frameworks
*  have the ability to generate, quote unquote, progress equally.
*  OK, so progress, just stepping back to that is, I mean, the way I see it, at least it requires
*  to understand whether we are making progress.
*  We have to have some goalpost in mind.
*  And that is not something that is given to us by nature.
*  We stipulate that.
*  Yeah.
*  So, I mean, depending on what our goals are, right?
*  It's are we making progress or not making progress?
*  But with theories contributing in a sort of pluralistic way,
*  I wouldn't necessarily say that each one is making progress so much as
*  putting them all together would allow you to see things in a more nuanced way.
*  Whereas working with a single theory sort of shuts off certain possibilities from
*  your mind.
*  And so, I don't know, like progress, if progress is the right word here for.
*  Yeah, I mean, we don't have to quibble about the word progress.
*  But I mean, you brought up, so go ahead, I'm sorry.
*  You brought up, I think you just brought up constraint.
*  Or maybe it popped into my head because I've been thinking about constraints as a very positive
*  thing in the past couple years.
*  And in a sense, you know, to make any movement, to have a thought, you have to have a constraint.
*  If you don't have any constraints, everything dissolves into a uniform distribution,
*  which means that there's nothing because there's everything and nothing can move, right?
*  And so you have to have some sort of constraints on your theories as well.
*  You have to have a viewpoint or I mean, you can have multiple viewpoints, right?
*  But within that one viewpoint, constraint is necessary, correct?
*  Within a single viewpoint, constraint is necessary.
*  To make a claim, you have to have background assumptions.
*  You have to say like certain things can't happen.
*  Sure.
*  Is that what you mean?
*  Yeah, it could be.
*  But what's a different way to put this?
*  Let's go with that.
*  Let's go.
*  Well, I mean, I guess with like testing a hypothesis, right, you don't test it unless it could
*  turn out to fail, right?
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  Well, maybe I'll bring this in because I was going to ask you about this anyway.
*  And maybe this can serve as the background example.
*  Since you have a background in studying consciousness,
*  research or studies or theories, and that used to be your entire thing, you said,
*  you're probably well aware of the modern dominance of the computational
*  or the brain as a computer metaphor, the computational approach to studying brains
*  and mind, right, in the neurosciences and the cognitive sciences.
*  And there are alternative metaphors, you know, that people have proposed that I suppose you
*  would call fringe.
*  But when you take the, so if you take the computational approach, you're assuming that
*  the brain is some sort, is computing something, right?
*  And then you can say, well, what is it computing?
*  And then you can use the mathematical functions that we have used to make predictions about
*  brain activity.
*  And that's been very, very successful.
*  And it wouldn't have been able to occur without the background metaphor that the brain is
*  a slug.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  So I'm not sure if that's an example for, you know, as a theory needing to have constraints
*  in order to make progress.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  So I mean, yeah.
*  So what you want is, you don't want to be using all the theories like as continuous,
*  which would be like really hard to do when you have like mutually inconsistent theories.
*  Right.
*  You want each theory to like give you some kind of constraint, like a way to see the
*  events unfolding according to a different view, right?
*  So like according to the computational view, I mean, what would be another, what would be
*  the alternative to the computational view?
*  That the brain is a dissipative structure, that the brain is a cascading phenomenon.
*  Yeah.
*  So totally.
*  Yeah.
*  So I mean, and that actually brings up like one of the sort of things I've been thinking
*  about with theories is that they're sort of like metaphors or analogies.
*  Like they're, they don't tell you like the way the world is.
*  They give you a way of looking at the world.
*  So like as a cascade or as a computer or whatever.
*  Right.
*  So I mean, I think the more of these we can like use and like compare them, you know,
*  compare them to each other, like we get a more, we capture more of the subtleties
*  that are going on in nature.
*  Do we capture them or do we appreciate them more?
*  Yeah.
*  Capture might be the wrong word there.
*  Well, yeah.
*  I mean, this brings up my own epistemic and resource limitations, right?
*  Because the alternative frameworks are attractive to me because I appreciate how
*  like the perspectivalism, right?
*  Is a different way of stating this.
*  Like I appreciate the different viewpoints that gives me into a phenomenon,
*  but I often wonder like how much purchase,
*  first of all, how much time do I spend on thinking about this?
*  Because I have a day job.
*  Secondly, how much purchase does it actually give me to dive in?
*  You know, how deep do I need to dive in?
*  And because there's a danger that I will gain nothing from it.
*  Right.
*  And you don't want to go down empty, dead end roads.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, with any research, right, there's a danger that you get nothing.
*  Nothing from it.
*  Right.
*  But you might think this is...
*  Sorry to interrupt, but if you're working in the mainstream, right,
*  your peers are going to believe whether you got something or not,
*  going to believe that you're doing it the right way.
*  Yeah, at least that.
*  Yeah.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Okay.
*  So I guess what I'm getting at like is your long-term vision for this
*  because you want to be able to catalog all of the different available theories.
*  Just because as it is right now, if you open nature or something like that,
*  you're not going to be able to access them.
*  But you want like some sort of resource ultimately
*  that is like the encyclopedia of theories about subject X, right?
*  Exactly.
*  Yes.
*  Is that your long-term goal?
*  I mean, that's a great way to put it.
*  And encyclopedia is the way I've thought about this a bit.
*  It's sort of like creating a system, like a socially mediated system.
*  Where people contribute their observations and theories they use
*  or their interpretations of those observations.
*  And those all get piled into...
*  That just becomes what science is.
*  And you get status about what people's backgrounds are.
*  This is an MD or this is a neuroscientist, right?
*  And you can generate out of that what you could even figure out what the consensus view is.
*  Or you could even have upvotes system involved.
*  But then there's also other options too, which are like...
*  Nature could have an issue every year where they highlight fringe theories.
*  I think people would be really interested in that.
*  It might increase their readership.
*  Sure.
*  Reality television shows increase viewership, right?
*  No, but I'm serious.
*  It's like...
*  I'm not calling fringe theories a train wreck, but everyone likes to see a train wreck.
*  And if it's something outside of your everyday experience in the world,
*  some people might tune in for the comedic value.
*  Or for like, oh, let me see about all these people that are doing science that is invalid
*  or pseudoscience are ridiculous.
*  And it makes me feel better to see all of this terrible science going on, right?
*  So there's entertainment value in it, right?
*  So I mean, that could be.
*  But I think part of what it would do is show people that actually these people are
*  doing science pretty well in some cases.
*  And especially, I'm sure, if nature did choose to have a fringe issue,
*  they would be highlighting cases where people were doing really interesting stuff.
*  And not just have it be like a comedy kind of thing.
*  I mean, I wasn't seriously suggesting that it should just have comedic value.
*  But I'm just agreeing with you that it would be popular.
*  But for more cynical reasons, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  I mean, fair enough.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I mean, I think people will laugh things off before they actually read into it.
*  And I mean, a lot of actually part of where my interest in fringe theories came from is
*  I just couldn't stop reading or listening to these bizarre ideas.
*  And yeah, at some point, you listen so much that you're like, wait, this isn't as
*  bizarre as I thought it was.
*  Or there's more to this than people think.
*  And often, the reason we laugh at aliens and UFOs is because
*  that's all we think.
*  We just think, oh, little green men.
*  And there's way more to it than that.
*  I don't laugh at aliens.
*  I think that's a dangerous idea, actually, to laugh at aliens.
*  But yeah, in a different way.
*  I don't laugh at the people studying UFOlogists or anything of that nature
*  as well.
*  Well, not anymore.
*  Well, I never did.
*  But this is a huge tangent that we can't go on, I suppose.
*  But I had a huge prior that some sort of extraterrestrial beings had been here before.
*  And so the last couple years with the UAPs now, I mean, it's not surprising,
*  but it's shocking that it's not bigger.
*  It's world-changing news, and it's shocking that it's not.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, disclosure has happened, and nobody cares.
*  I mean, people are still like, yeah, I still don't believe it.
*  Especially people who were around in the 60s when stuff was coming out about UFOs,
*  and then turned out all to be a hoax.
*  It was just a weather balloon or something.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  I think people who've had that experience of being hopeful and then being disappointed
*  are more resistant now.
*  Oh, you think so?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, so would you call...
*  What would we call it?
*  The idea of extraterrestrial beings?
*  What I want to do is give it a label.
*  Is it fringe still or is it mainstream?
*  Where would it be in your continuum?
*  I mean, I think we could still call it theories and ufology.
*  But yeah, I mean, there's problems with calling them aliens, right?
*  Just like calling anybody an alien is...
*  Oh, it's offensive?
*  Yeah.
*  Politically incorrect, perhaps.
*  Is it derogatory?
*  I don't know.
*  I never...
*  Derogatory?
*  Yeah.
*  You can't use words anymore.
*  Anyway, yeah, you can't use words anymore.
*  But, right, so what's the question if aliens...
*  Yeah, is that fringe or mainstream?
*  Or where is it on your continuum?
*  So, I mean, there are definitely theories and ufology that are still very fringe.
*  So it's not one thing.
*  For example, that the aliens are here
*  as rebranding themselves as the angels and demons from the past.
*  They're rebranding themselves for a scientific audience.
*  That's a very fringe theory still.
*  But then I think in general, the whole idea that we're actually seeing something here,
*  like these are craft, like these are not just weather balloons or clouds,
*  is becoming mainstream.
*  I would say it's in the transition phase.
*  Just considering how many people still just have no idea.
*  It's not...
*  The New York Times isn't putting out articles about these are real.
*  People are really still hesitant about making any claims in this vicinity.
*  But I mean, literally, it's like in Congress, right?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like people have made statements that, yes,
*  we recovered crashed craft, including non-human biologics.
*  And we're all like, all right, I got to go to work.
*  See you later.
*  See you later.
*  Thanks for letting me know.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  Yeah. It's insane.
*  Yeah. But I could talk about this all day, but it's not the focus of my podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  We'll continue the conversation afterward.
*  But for the purpose of the podcast,
*  we should say that...
*  So what I have called your extreme pluralism,
*  there are cases in which you deny that a fringe theory should be taken seriously.
*  I mean, you're not...
*  Well, I guess you wouldn't call it a fringe theory.
*  But you want to talk about a few of the reasons why we might not accept a theory
*  as unequal footing?
*  Why we shouldn't or why we don't?
*  In cases why we should not, normatively.
*  I would say if it's fraudulent, like if it's intending to deceive people
*  or if its intent is not focused on general well-being of humans and the planet.
*  How do we tell?
*  Those would be two indicators.
*  How do we tell?
*  I mean, I think that's up to our best judgment, right?
*  We don't always tell.
*  This is a problem.
*  Our own judgment is a problem.
*  Always, right?
*  Our own judgment is always a problem.
*  Yeah.
*  One of the things I was thinking about is that if a quote unquote good pluralist
*  could never win an office, political office,
*  because to win political office, you have to know the right answer
*  and convince people that you know the right answer.
*  Right, and that there is a right answer.
*  That there is a right answer even.
*  Right, and that there is a right answer.
*  Right.
*  That there is a right answer even.
*  And I know it and I'm certain, which is very different from the pluralist
*  who's more like a stoic almost, right?
*  Yeah, in what sense?
*  Like a stoic.
*  Well, forget I said stoic.
*  I don't want to talk about stoicism, but sort of accepting things as they are, right?
*  It's more, maybe more like a Buddhist, we'll say, than a stoic.
*  How about that?
*  Is that a better analogy?
*  That's interesting.
*  I mean, there is definitely something,
*  when you get into that pluralist mindset, there is something that like eases up in you.
*  Like there's something sort of.
*  Oh, yeah, it does feel like a burden has been lifted almost sometimes, right?
*  Yeah, where it's like you don't have to,
*  yeah, you don't have to like, you're not, with pluralism, right?
*  It's not like, eventually we're going to get to the true, like the right theory, right?
*  It's like the one true theory, right?
*  Talk about that more, because you go into some depth on that.
*  So yeah, what does this mean for the future of science?
*  Are we going to figure it all out?
*  Yeah, so like the idea with using a pluralist approach is not just to like,
*  you know, be covering all our bases and, you know, make sure we're
*  including the theory that ends up being the one true theory.
*  The idea is that pluralism is permanent.
*  It's not something that is going to go away, right?
*  We're not, and that doesn't mean you can't say,
*  you can't make statements that are true, right?
*  But they're always true according to some theory.
*  And yeah, so I mean, I don't know where we're going with the future.
*  But you've talked about, so that there is no, there basically will be no ends.
*  And in principle.
*  Right. Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah. Right.
*  So that's my no end principle.
*  Yeah. Sorry. I forgot that it was called the no end principle.
*  Yeah. What is the no end principle?
*  Well, it's kind of a funny name for it.
*  I don't know if that's what it should be called.
*  I mean, it definitely captures what it is, I think.
*  But the idea that there is no end to the scientific discoveries and creations that we,
*  as humans, can make.
*  And there's no end in the sense of like, there's no final stage at which we like,
*  figured it all out.
*  Right. And I don't think we want that either.
*  Right. We think we want, we seem to think we want that.
*  But I mean, that just means like all avenues are closed.
*  There's nothing new for us.
*  Right. And the world, I mean, the universes.
*  Expanding, right? At least in some sense.
*  Well, I mean, according to some mainstream theory.
*  According to some mainstream theory.
*  Well, time is continuing, right? And things are unfolding.
*  Right. And things that we've never considered might be worth considering in the future.
*  I mean, and to like, we go back and forth between what theories are true.
*  One of my favorite phenomenon is that old historical ideas that have either been discarded or forgotten
*  tend to come back and get rediscovered.
*  And I shouldn't say this without like definitive examples coming to mind.
*  But it's always like some historical figure that used to think this way, and then it went away.
*  And then it went away.
*  And now we've discovered some things and lo and behold, it connects to that past thing very well.
*  And I'm not sure if this idea connects to your oscillations idea, fringe mainstream
*  oscillations idea. But maybe does it?
*  Does what I just said connect?
*  Oh, maybe you could reflect on how it does then.
*  Yeah. So I mean, it was like even like heliocentrism, right?
*  There were ideas that the sun was the center of the solar system in ancient,
*  from ancient Greek times. I forget who it is, but you can probably do a quick Google search.
*  And then we had a geocentric system, right?
*  And then back to heliocentrism, right?
*  That's the sort of oscillation that I have in mind.
*  But does that necessarily mean we're going to go back to geocentrism?
*  I think we can. I mean, Einstein thought that we could see things in both ways.
*  Yeah.
*  Because of relativism.
*  Yeah. And I guess another example from physics is wave particle duality, which before that was
*  born, we had wave theory and particle theory or corpuscular theory. And those oscillated back and
*  forth until eventually we landed on wave particle duality, like light is both a wave and a particle.
*  Let's bring it into brain sciences or psychology. So let's say telepathy. Is it going to be talking
*  about telepathy in the next hundred years as a scientifically meritor- scientifically studyable,
*  veritable thing?
*  So I'm not, I don't want to
*  be the fringe theorist, but I would say yes.
*  I'm not saying what your opinion about telepathy is. I'm saying, do you think that telepathy will
*  be- become more mainstream? You know, things like telepathy, things like remote viewing,
*  let's say things that are like psychological phenomenon that have been positive that we now
*  kind of discard as fringe.
*  I mean, we just know so little about this stuff is the reason we dismiss it. Like remote viewing is
*  like, remote viewing is out of control. It's like, I mean, it's amazing what these people are doing.
*  No, I mean, yeah, it's out of control. It's like, I guess the fringe sense too, right? But that's
*  when you don't know anything about it, right? When you actually like read up on it, it's like,
*  they're, you know, they're not just putting some guy in a room and saying what's in this envelope.
*  Right. I mean, they did do that. CIA did that. But they're like having like multiple people
*  come in a room and each of them remote view some specific geological coordinates and then using
*  each of their reports to put together a single report of like what's at that location.
*  And they've, I mean, people use remote viewing to discover Cleopatra's palace.
*  And like, there's some academic, he won't say who he is, but a guy who is an expert in remote
*  viewing has been like brought in to help him find like Columbus's ships. So I mean, this is a real
*  thing. And could happen. Could become mainstream. What's your take on the recent rise in
*  hallucinogenic usage for, so what's going on when we take one of the 600 recent hallucinogens,
*  you know, MDMA, mescaline, are we connecting with the universe or is something happening in our
*  brains to think that we're connecting with the universe and the collective unconscious and so on?
*  Sorry, I'm throwing out fringy turns to you. Yeah. That's great. I mean, I think it's important to be
*  able to think in all these different ways, right? To sort of look at it from the mainstream
*  perspective of like, this is just hallucination and being able to move from that to thinking about
*  like, oh, I'm getting in touch with the source or yeah, I don't know what's what are some other
*  theories here. I mean, it being like a treatment for depression. Yeah, major depression. And this
*  actually alludes to your points that you've made that ancestral knowledge, speaking of hallucinogens,
*  right? Comes back to the floor. And by the way, indigenous peoples, right? That's a group that we
*  suppress as fringe. Is that, do I have that right? Yeah. So a lot of indigenous knowledge is,
*  I mean, yeah, indigenous science too is like very marginalized, right? It's not,
*  part of it is it's not necessarily done according to the same standards, right? And there's a lot of
*  like spiritual aspects that indigenous people want to include and do include. So it's not the kind
*  of thing that like can get accepted to nature, right? Or whatever. But I mean, more and more,
*  I mean, more and more, it's like we're, you know, sort of like picking and choosing the
*  aspects of indigenous science that we like. And like, you know, re-appropriating them for our
*  Western mindset. Right. Good drugs. Yeah. Including good drugs. Yeah. Including,
*  for example. This actually is really interesting. Right. But yeah, I mean, like so far, it's not like
*  we're like, oh, we've found ayahuasca gets us in touch with the source, right? It's like,
*  or I guess let's talk about psilocybin. It's not that that gets us in touch with some deeper reality.
*  It's that it sort of allows you to detach from yourself in a way that might lead you to have
*  less symptoms of depression. Right. Like it's that's the way we end up
*  like re-appropriating is like for our own interests and needs, which are not the same as
*  like what indigenous peoples are. In some cases, at least. And are you a woman?
*  Yes. So because- She or they? She or they. So women also marginalized. Before we talk about that,
*  do I need to actively silence something to be part of the problem? Or it's like,
*  is indifference part of the problem also? Or lack of interest? Like, do I need to be the gatekeeper
*  that's actively marginalizing? Yeah, I think you have to, I think the active silencing is the
*  problem that at least as I see it. Okay. It's the like explicit statements of, you know, that's
*  pseudoscience. Or like, that's not real science. Or whatever, like anything people say in order to
*  affect or in order that the effect is like the theory is not taken seriously. Like, and especially,
*  I mean, authorities are responsible for like anybody who's taken to be authority in some
*  discipline, right, is the most responsible here for not saying things like that.
*  Yeah, so I definitely don't think like you're silencing if you choose not to read up on a
*  fringe theory. Right, that's just a matter of your interest and choice.
*  Before I say this next thing, I just, I would be amiss if I didn't, for those who are only listening,
*  if you're watching, this is very obvious, but especially coming off of talking about psychedelics,
*  there are beams of light rays emanating from behind Laura right now. So it's, it's, it's
*  quite mystical visually. So if you're only listening, you can kind of imagine. So, okay,
*  I just had to put that in there because it was very appropriate to the,
*  Yeah, they're like little rape posts. Yeah. Yeah. So, so sorry. So backing up,
*  I mean, you write about how women have been one of the more marginalized groups of scientists,
*  right? Is that the case? So in that case, we're talking about your, you know, marginalization
*  regarding fringe scientists and fringe theories. Is that the case in philosophy as well? Are women
*  philosophers more likely to be silenced, marginalized? This is troubled waters for me,
*  so I'm trying to tread lightly. Yeah. Yeah, troubled waters for all of us. I would say,
*  yes, there is. There is marginalization of similar kind happening in philosophy.
*  I mean, part of it, like, what I hear people talk about with like, as being a woman,
*  are things more like, oh, wow, you're so articulate, or like, oh, you know, where it's like,
*  sorry. I mean, that's like for a woman. Yeah, for a woman, where it's like, you know, like,
*  you wouldn't be saying that to me. Or, I mean, that's not one that I get. That's what I've heard
*  people talk about where it's like, of course, you don't get it. No, I'm not articulate.
*  That's not what I meant. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, you definitely see that, like,
*  most philosophy departments, and really, actually, philosophy of science, you get mostly men.
*  Is that still true? I mean, they're trying to change it, right? It's like, you want to meet the
*  50-50 expectation, right? But do you? All right. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. So I think that opportunity
*  wise, you definitely do. And of course, this is just opinion. But I just think it's absurd to
*  enforce an outcome of 50-50. Because you're not taking it into consideration people's interests.
*  You're not... Opportunity, yes. Because then you're allowing anyone who's interested
*  to have the opportunity. But if zero women are interested, why would you force 50% of the
*  population of anything to be women? Yeah. Yeah. Well, so you might think, like,
*  there are just less women that are interested in philosophy of science.
*  But I think... I didn't say that. I'm just saying a very abstract level for any program.
*  Yeah. So I mean, maybe it's just, you want the same, you want equal opportunities offered to
*  everyone who is interested. I think that's fair. But I think also, like, some of the reason people
*  aren't interested is because they don't think they are the type of person who could succeed in that
*  field. Like, one of the things I do is show my students pictures of all the different authors
*  they're reading so they can see, like, oh, that looks like me. Or, like, you know, where it's like,
*  okay, they're not... Like, philosophers aren't just old white men with beards, right? They're...
*  They look a lot of different ways. Okay, good. So, but really, I just wanted to talk about how
*  there are certain types of overrepresented, marginalized scientists, right, or theorists.
*  And so I wanted to highlight that because that's something that you focus on. And also that
*  it's not the quote unquote extreme pluralism that I'm, you know, I turned it extreme pluralism,
*  but your brand of pluralism doesn't include, you know, intentionally harmful or fraudulent
*  theories. However, but it always comes back to human judgment, I would argue. And I don't see,
*  like, a clear cut path forward for judging these things in a way, right? So I kind of go back and
*  forth, like, because on some level, we have to also trust our intuitions, which means not to
*  trust anyone or anything. Yeah, I mean, at some point, you do, it does come down to human judgment.
*  I mean, for me, like, I think having an honor statement that, you know, says I'm doing science
*  to benefit humanity and the planet or whatever the universe, if that's how far you go,
*  is enough. And from there, it's like people have to like, like, you could like flag a certain theory
*  as like, this looks morally suspect, or this looks harmful. And it's, but yeah, I mean, again,
*  it's like you're not, I, yeah, I can't give you like the perfect solution. Yeah. Right. Because
*  who gets to flag it? And, right. And if I'm a trickster, I could write an honorary statement.
*  You can get away with it. Right. Okay. So what I want to know is like, what is the, like, if I want
*  to go down historically as having been a fringe theorist, it sounds like there's a recipe. Become
*  an expert in one field and have credentials in one field, right? And then stray from that field
*  and make some claims in another field that are outside of the mainstream. But is that always the
*  case? Because it seems like there should be, you know, fringe theorists should have all sorts of
*  different qualities. There shouldn't just be a specific path. Are those just the ones that we're
*  paying attention to and that we like because they make for good stories or jump out historically,
*  or do we have a sense of like, where we should aim if we want to be that type of person? I think,
*  yeah, I think part of that is because they're coming from one field and making claims about
*  another field. The people who in the field that they're from, right, will maybe have some sympathies.
*  Right. So you might get a community of people. Right. I mean, this is totally common, right,
*  that fringe theories are taken up by popular audiences. They're not just, it's not just academics
*  hating on them, right? There are people who actually believe these things. And I think,
*  yeah, I think coming from another field might give you a certain audience. But I don't want to say
*  like that's the only way to become fringe. I mean, there's certainly two people who don't have any
*  degree and are coming up with fringe theories. So let's say I never went to high school,
*  never opened a math book. I have no education. I'm not self-educated. I just have lived out in
*  the forest, right? And I know some rudimentary English. If I come and I have no malintent,
*  I have no intent to lie. And I come with the theory that the stars are made of a poisonous,
*  I don't a poisonous that they're actually know that the stars are actually
*  holes tornadoes. Oh, tornadoes. Go ahead. I was trying to come up with something outlandish. What
*  did you say holes in the night sky holes in the night sky and are basically collections of
*  teeth? Right? That's my theory. Okay. And is that a valid theory? Do we do? Does do your limits of
*  pluralism include that? If you're serious, if you're dead serious about it, yes. So I know you would
*  have out you would probably have observations that make you think that like maybe some teeth fell out
*  of the sky on your head one day, right or something. Right. And or that's how they grow. The stars are
*  channeling the teeth through totally. I mean, everything in the universe is connected. You are
*  made of stardust. Oh my gosh, we're really really going going out the way. But you know,
*  you get what I'm saying, because some things just don't smell right, right? So I feel like I have a
*  good bullshit meter. And I don't know whether I do. But I think I do. And so if someone, you know,
*  some kid came up and said, Hey, stars are just collections of teeth. I would, you know, and he
*  believed it. He obviously believed it. I would think, well, you know, maybe you should have some
*  more DMT or whatever. I was, you know, or basically, I would I would kind of discard not discard it,
*  it would just be it would be indifferent to it. And I would kind of be upset if that idea was put
*  on the same footing as other ideas about how what I think somebody would have reasons for thinking
*  that if they thought that I know that you probably have conversations like this all the time. And I'm
*  sorry, because I'm kind of putting you I'm just kind of asking you to stretch a little bit, right.
*  And I don't want to be putting you into a corner. Well, I mean, so I think, yeah, theory like that
*  isn't on the same footing, because it's not going to get uptake and attention. Right. People are
*  just going to be like, I don't care about that. That's not interesting. That doesn't make any
*  sense to me. My brain can't get on board. But we should index it in the in the encyclopedia.
*  Yeah. So it needs to take some room in our if I want to study stars, then that needs to take some
*  room in my head. As I'm trying to learn in your head in the database. Yeah. But if I'm if I'm
*  interested in studying stars, I need to go to that database. Right. And that's going to be in the day
*  you might see it you might see it in that database. But this is part of why I want like,
*  or suggest having like an uploading system. Right. That's social though. And basically,
*  if a thing on social media gets a ton of upvotes, it is clear indication to ignore it for me.
*  Even if it's okay. It's a contrarian viewpoint, right? cynical and contrarian.
*  No, totally. It means. Yeah, for me, I'm like consensus. That's not what we're looking for.
*  That's actually a problem. All right, Laura, so I don't want to take more of your time. Did we
*  did we miss anything that you wanted to chat about? We never really talked about that. Sarah Bellum.
*  I'm not sure. That's okay. No, next time. Next time. Yeah. All right. Once I do my case study
*  on that, we can talk about that. Very good. What we didn't say is that I work in the building next
*  to you and you and I are going to go what what are we going to do psilocybin lots of psilocybin
*  together around campus and stuff. Let's do it. Thank you so much for the time. I find the work
*  really interesting. And as listeners maybe, and viewers can tell that it's a difficult topic. And
*  oh, you know what, can I ask you this before before we go? What kind of feedback are you getting from
*  other philosophers and or from scientists on these ideas? I can imagine scientists being angry, right,
*  or upset to leave at the least. Yeah, I mean, so you actually get a lot of scientists who are like,
*  Oh, my God, thank God you're saying this, like, I've been good. You know, I thought that COVID was a
*  lab leak for a long time. And like, only recently, that's been like accepted. And just like the
*  amount of ridicule I got for just saying that it's just, you know, people like, were scared of me.
*  And like, you know, so scientists have actually been really receptive, I guess, especially when
*  they're really steeped in like, whatever they're doing, and they end up with in some place that is
*  like not acceptable. And I actually, you know, I get a lot of pushback, but mostly from people who
*  are like on board with the general idea, like, what I get pushback on is like, kind of things you were
*  giving me some pushback on, like, really, we should include everyone. Yeah, I don't draw I don't draw
*  line. What is the I'm sorry, keep asking questions. What I promise this is the last one.
*  What is the lesson for moving forward? The reason here's, here's where I'm coming from. I'm often
*  asked, you know, what I've changed my mind about, or I often ask guests, you know, what you've
*  changed your mind about. And often someone is, whether they've changed their mind or not, and
*  usually haven't, they're coming from a very particular point of view. But when I asked them
*  the question, what did you change your mind about, this assumes that they had an opinion in the
*  first place. And what I kind of feel like I have done, and I've been told I'm a very opinionated
*  and a judgmental person. So this does not accord, there's some cognitive dissonance with the way I
*  think of myself versus the way that I'm judged viewed by other people. But I kind of think of
*  it in terms of, I never really had a hard opinion about anything theoretically in neuroscience,
*  for example, I'm saying, right? And is it better to go in with a beginner's open,
*  beginner's mindset open to lots of different theoretical interpretations? Or is it better to
*  go in under a very, you know, a certain theory, so that you can compare it to all of the other
*  valid theories? Does that question make sense? And do you have an answer? It does make sense. And I
*  think both both of those techniques could be useful in different ways, right? I mean,
*  it helps to have a theory in mind. Because you can see where is it falling short, I guess kind
*  of coming in with like a blank slate might make you a little bit less better off, I don't know.
*  But could be interesting to like coming in without any certainty about which theory is best.
*  And theories can be good for like different ends rather than it being like,
*  a theory is better than another theory, just simplicitor, right? It's like,
*  theory is better because it helps you avoid earthquakes or that was like one of the reasons
*  continental drift was better than fixism. Right? So allowing certain, allowing for certain things
*  that we as humans find important and useful, right? Would be a reason to go with one theory
*  over another. But not permanently just like in this particular for this particular end, right?
*  So it's kind of like a pragmatist view. But also, yeah, I don't know if we're going in with the
*  blank slate. Yeah, you can't there's no such thing as a blank slate, right? No, totally. Right? You've
*  got to have something. Yeah. All right, Laura, well, I'm not, I'm not really sure what we did
*  here today, but I had fun speaking with you. And I hope if nothing else, this is a very different
*  kind of podcast episode for Brain Inspired. And I hope if nothing else, it inches or influences,
*  you know, a handful of listeners to think a little bit more pluralistically, if not your extreme
*  version. But I really appreciate you spending the time with me. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you so much, Paul.
