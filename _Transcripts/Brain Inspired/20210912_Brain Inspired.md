# BI 113 David Barack and John Krakauer: Two Views On Cognition
**Brain Inspired:** [September 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNYjrodFNrM)
*  If you really want to be interdisciplinary, you want to be a neuroscientist, you want to
*  be a philosopher, you have to do those things. You can't just read about them. There is a
*  practical or a practice or a praxis-oriented kind of aspect.
*  What happens is scientists prematurely automatize the important ideas and devote all their thinking
*  to lower level methodological problems. So they stop thinking.
*  The single neuron approach to understanding cognition was really spinning its wheels for
*  the past decade and a half or more. There was seemingly marginal progress on certain
*  issues but not on these core complicated aspects of cognition.
*  Based on a bet that David and I had, what kind of neuroscience is going to give us the
*  best insights, intuitions, concepts to think about that difference between the cognitive
*  system and the sensory motor system? And the argument is...
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Welcome everyone, it's Paul. So today I have on David Barak from Columbia University and
*  John Krakauer at Johns Hopkins. Of course, John's been on the show many times now, but
*  this is David's first time on the podcast. So David is both a philosopher and a neuroscientist
*  and that is one of the things that we discuss in the beginning. His experience is working
*  on both sides there, the philosophy side and the neuroscience side. But the main reason
*  they're on is because of a recent paper they collaborated on called Two Views on the Cognitive
*  Brain. In this paper they champion the recent population-based dynamical systems approach
*  to studying brains that I've discussed with many others on previous episodes. And David
*  and John argue that this kind of approach gives reason to be optimistic about making
*  real progress understanding how brain activity underlies higher cognitive functions that
*  have historically resisted explanation. So we talk about some of the issues that they
*  discuss more deeply in the paper. As always, I want to express my gratitude to my Patreon
*  supporters. I'm really grateful that you took the time and made the effort to sign up and
*  essentially donate a couple dollars a month to the podcast. Thank you. Show notes for
*  this episode are at braininspired.co.au slash podcast slash 113 113. Enjoy. David, John,
*  thank you for being here. Welcome. Thank you for having us. Pleased to be here. Thank you
*  again Paul. I feel like we're almost a couple. I know this is a record number for you. I
*  think I believe you are the highest most frequent visitor John. Congratulations or I'm sorry.
*  I'm deeply honored. I'm deeply honored. But David, you're a first time first time guest
*  here. So let's focus on you for just a couple of minutes. I kind of want to know about,
*  you know, well, you know, your background, but also how you're managing the philosophy
*  slash neuroscience world and the social aspect of that. Like do all your neuroscience friends
*  hate you? Do all your philosopher friends hate you? Or does everyone love you? Well,
*  love is a strong term here, but I think there is some cross disciplinary respect and I think
*  importantly that respect has been increasing or as the dialogue channels of communication
*  are opening up and being founded coming on a show like this, of course helps encourage
*  those channels of communication as well. So my background was I went to the Claremont
*  College is actually outside Los Angeles and I had an advisor. I was very into philosophy
*  when I arrived in college and I had an advisor Brian Keely, a philosopher who has done a
*  little bit of bench work as well in neuroscience who was just a fabulous mentor and turned
*  me on to the intersection right, right almost from day one when I was in college intersection
*  of neuroscience and philosophy. And at Pitzer College where I went to school, you were able
*  to design your own major and I designed my own major. I called it consciousness studies,
*  but it was really philosophy, psychology and neuroscience. And I was tutored, mentored
*  by Brian as well as a psychologist who has passed sadly about 10 years ago now, William
*  Banks at Pomona who was a very close advisor of mine as well who was very interested in
*  consciousness. And so my undergraduate studies really were already at the intersection of
*  these disciplines, albeit focused on experience, the qualitative nature of consciousness and
*  related aspects of subjectivity and so forth of the mind. When I graduated from college,
*  I had the I think not too uncommon experience of what the hell do I do now, especially with
*  a degree in consciousness science or consciousness studies. And I decided to get a more rigorous
*  training in analytic philosophy. And I did that. I got a master's degree in philosophy
*  from Milwaukee, but then realized that I still loved some of the empirical aspects of the
*  study of mine. And by then I had decided to move away from consciousness, which I still
*  find to be very interesting and completely confounding of basically every theory I've
*  never seen.
*  A rational decision.
*  Yeah, that's right. Especially given my own intellectual limitations and time and so forth.
*  And so I decided to pursue fundamental questions in cognition and in cognitive neuroscience.
*  And as well, I matriculated at Duke University where they're only about at the time and there
*  still aren't very many interdisciplinary programs at the graduate level that combine philosophy
*  and the neurosciences. And Duke University has this wonderful institutional mechanism
*  for fostering interdisciplinary endeavor at the graduate level. They're called graduate
*  admitting programs. And I was in the cognitive neuroscience graduate admitting program. And
*  I was able to matriculate within Duke to the philosophy department my second year for my
*  actual PhD. But I worked in neurobiology and cognitive neuroscience the entire time I was
*  studying for my PhD. So I would, that gives you a little capsule of sort of my background
*  and it has always been interdisciplinary. Although the focus of my research has changed
*  over time. I still, as we're on here today to discuss, have a focus on the conceptual
*  and theoretical foundations of cognitive neuroscience. But my empirical work and a lot of my conceptual
*  work these days actually has to do with reasoning. What is reasoning? How does reasoning connect
*  to the selective pressures on organisms? And in particular, how does foraging bear on reasoning
*  up to and including formal mathematical reasoning? So I have some papers in progress and sort
*  of in the submit long drawn out submission process that is philosophy applying principles
*  of foraging to formal mathematical reasoning. And then I also investigate the neural circuits
*  of reasoning from a foraging perspective. So that sort of gives you a flavor for the
*  way that I weave together these diverse disciplines.
*  What are you? Are you a philosopher? Are you a neuroscientist? What do you tell Aunt Clotille?
*  I don't know who Aunt Clotille is.
*  Oh man. I am a philosopher and a neuroscientist. So I work in both disciplines. I publish in
*  both disciplines as best I can to the highest standards of each field. It is extremely challenging.
*  If I'm forced to choose, I don't know.
*  I'm not forcing you.
*  Sometimes it depends on the context.
*  Yeah. I don't think that's a useful distinction to make in these sorts of terms because they
*  really feed off of each other as the paper we're going to talk about attests to. John,
*  you have been really, I don't want to say recently diving into it because you've always
*  been into philosophy, but do you have the perfect, the optimal trajectory for circling
*  back? Someone like me, right? Who I guess is probably, I don't know. Now that I'm not
*  in neuroscience and experimental neuroscience, now I'm just doing philosophy it seems all
*  the time. But the most useful sort of cyclic and duration within the cycles of experimental,
*  versus philosophy, et cetera.
*  Yeah. I mean, there are so many things to say here. One I think is, philosophers can
*  become quite defensive if they're seen mainly as a kind of like a statistics department
*  or a university, a way to clean up people's thinking in whatever discipline they do, right?
*  That it's a kind of mental hygiene so that people get a little bit of a sense of what
*  they are getting confused over and help them realize the contradictions in their own thoughts.
*  So kind of consult, a thinking consult, right? But of course philosophers don't want to consider
*  themselves just that. They have their own interests, just like statisticians have their
*  own formal interests. They're not there just to do a power analysis for you, right? So
*  in other words, there's a little bit of that when it comes to philosophy, especially when
*  it's applied to science.
*  But on that, you know, and then as we, you and I have talked a lot before, you know,
*  Hassock Chang has talked about this idea that the philosophy of science is sort of complementary
*  science. It's thinking about the things that scientists in their daily activities gloss
*  over, right? It's just filling in the gaps, right? And another way that I would put it
*  is, you know, I would just did a podcast recently on skill learning. And, you know, I made the
*  point that athletes automatize all their lower level stuff, that they can devote their
*  cognition to strategies and working out what the opponent's going to do next. In other
*  words, we're worrying so much as amateurs about our backhand that we can't possibly
*  think about what our opponent's doing. So, you know, you actually shunt your cognitive,
*  your precious, you know, cognitive resources to higher level problems because everything
*  else has been automatized. The problem, I think, in science, and in neuroscience in
*  particular, is that's reversed. What happens is scientists prematurely automatize the important
*  ideas and devote all their thinking to lower level, level methodological problems. So they
*  stop thinking about the bigger, what's a representation, what's inference, you know, what can reinforcement
*  learning tell us or not tell us? So in a bizarre inversion, they prematurely shut down thinking
*  about the big complex parts so that they can devote all their cognitive load to modeling,
*  to doing analysis, to looking at data.
*  Do you think that's because there is such a load cognitively to everything that everyone's
*  doing? So you have to choose, right?
*  Right. So in other words, scientists, and I have been thinking about this only recently,
*  like inverse athletes, is that you, the nature of the discipline and the complexity of its
*  methods basically make it very difficult to devote that amount of practice to the actual
*  higher level concepts which are saturating, especially cognitive neuroscience. And so
*  philosophers sometimes can actually unload that burden a little bit and sort of do some
*  of that thinking that can complement the amount of cognitive load devoted to the techniques,
*  to the math, to the that stuff. And that's what I think is happening. And the point I
*  would make is that's not going to work, right? In other words, you're going to have to devote
*  some time to worrying about the higher level problems associated with the assumptions you
*  make before you dive down into the methodology.
*  John, I'm not sure what you're describing is so unusual across the sciences, right?
*  So this is this Cunian notion of normal science or typical science or something like this.
*  And I think you might find this kind of division of labor maybe or this division of attention
*  within scientists where oftentimes there is a lot of normal science that occurs and a
*  lot of progress is being made. We shouldn't minimize the work that's being done. Despite
*  sort of shelving bigger conceptual problems. And maybe cognitive neuroscience in that sense
*  isn't so unique. Maybe it really is a feature of all the sciences to have this kind of focus
*  on the local issues, on the techniques, on the methods, in the math, with only the occasional
*  engagement with these bigger issues. Now, of course, Cun famously said that when you
*  begin to deal with these bigger issues, that's when you sort of get revolution. That's when
*  you get paradigm shifts. That's when you have a real change in the disciplinary matrix in
*  the way that the discipline proceeds. And maybe what we're saying is that it's time
*  for that in cognitive neuroscience. But I'm not so sure it's really distinct from other
*  scientific disciplines in that regard.
*  I would just say on that, that's true. It's just in cognitive neuroscience. I mean, I've
*  made this point before. We do not have the Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of the
*  Liver or the Kidney, right? In other words, cognition in the brain seem to lend themselves
*  to the need to think more than I think is necessarily the case when you're working out
*  how the kidney concentrates urine. In other words, yes, that's true. And Cunian framework
*  can be applied, I'm assuming, just as much to liver science as brain science. And yet
*  there's this extra thing, which I think is real, which is this mind matter issue, this
*  cognition, you know, the whole framework we've got. So in other words, and the final point
*  I'd like to make about this is I think that scientists, you know, my brother talks about
*  this at SFI, you know, that scientists are actually quite rare in the science domain.
*  You've got a lot of ancillary professions, you know, statisticians, programmers, engineers,
*  a lot of professions that are creed around this whole domain. But actual scientists,
*  people who are worrying in this more fuzzy global, less local way is increasingly rare,
*  right? And I think I've spoken to you about, you know, when you read Oliver Sacks' little
*  essay on Darwin, coming back from his travels and worrying about the sex of plants, it just
*  exudes a kind of scientific curiosity and creativity that we simply do not promote in
*  current science. And I think that philosophy in a way can be a counterbalance to that tendency
*  if used properly.
*  Well, one of the motivations for my question is that I, I think, like a lot of people,
*  but you know, become became disillusioned with the specialties that I was learning.
*  And of course, you have to do a very deep dive and learn a very specific skill set to
*  become an expert at anything. But this is antithetical to the overall drive to be a
*  Renaissance person will say person these days Renaissance person, which is what maybe maps
*  on to what you're calling a scientist, John. And so that's what I'm wondering. I mean, my
*  question was about neuroscience and philosophy specifically, but of course, then you have to
*  have circle back around and learn more mathematics and you have to circle back around and learn all
*  sorts of different topics. And what is the right path to maximize the probability of becoming the
*  Renaissance person that you want to be right to be most efficient?
*  Can I give one more analogy to that, Paul? When I'm teaching medical students or residents on the
*  wards, for example, and you see a patient, I tell them that you should peg your reading to what you
*  just saw. So you just saw a patient with hemiparesis now is the time to read about
*  motor cortex. If you have a patient with a headache, now is the time to read about headaches.
*  Just in time learning is another.
*  Yes. In other words, create your memory palace around a particular instantiation. And so if you
*  develop, let's say for the, in the broader sense, that's an intellectual stance that you sort of
*  read around an event, you worry. The word I use is learn to worry about what you're seeing and what
*  you're thinking and what you're assuming. And take that worry to question what has been said about
*  hemiparesis and headaches. Are there strange, you know, characteristics of this patient that don't
*  fit into the existing framework? And so if you want to be optimal with respect to reading, yes,
*  you can read some seminal texts like Coon's book, for example, obviously. But really, what you
*  should do is just get into the habit of reading around in the philosophical literature and others,
*  when you come across your particular worries as you travel as a scientist along your particular
*  trajectory. And I think that's what is lacking is that intellectual stance to read around your subject
*  as you go.
*  To see. So now one of the most joyous things about my, my retired condition is that I can do that. I can afford to do that.
*  David, you're more freshly like me. You're kind of more freshly out of. So John's, I think in his late 70s,
*  early, I don't know. I can't remember. That's accurate. Yes. He's ancient, I think is the yeah. Anyway,
*  he's he's a little more removed from like, let's say graduate school, right? Then you and I are. Is
*  that even possible at the graduate level, for instance, do you think? I mean, and maybe I'm
*  asking the wrong person because you seem to have superhuman strength to to be involved in both
*  philosophy and in neuroscience in very productive ways. And I don't know how possible is that?
*  Yeah, I think it is very challenging as a general statement, and it does require a certain kind of
*  commitment. And it is a sacrifice. You we all have finite amounts of time. We have to allocate that
*  time according to our interests. When one does true interdisciplinary work, you need to have the
*  expert foundations in each discipline and allowing you have to allocate time to build the that
*  expertise base. And so it does take a time commitment. And that time commitment takes
*  away from doing things that are kind of essential to the business of academia, like publishing and
*  and the like. It also, by the way, incurs a personal cost. So I took, you know, time that
*  I devoted to my intellectual pursuits in multiple disciplines that I could have spent, for example,
*  devoting to social concerns. And so there is a cost to doing this kind of this kind of
*  disciplinary interdisciplinary expertise building. This kind of comes back to what John was talking
*  about also with tending to prematurely automate our comfort level with some concepts and notions,
*  right? But this is what I want. One of the most beneficial things that you can do is come to the
*  place where it is automated, where you don't where it doesn't some concept, like, let's say,
*  inference, you're reading and you read the word inference, where that concept does not provide
*  friction and slow you down and make you have to think, right? Bring in your system to type two
*  type thinking process, your executive functioning processes, you want to be able to have that
*  automated so that then you can use that and it just brings into the fore and continues in the
*  stream of your thought. I don't know if I had a question for that, but maybe just asking you,
*  John, if you think, you know, because that is kind of the goal of being a Renaissance person, right?
*  And you but you see this as antithetical to what's actually happening in science, I guess that's a
*  question. Yeah, I mean, I think one has to distinguish a little bit between, you know,
*  you know, Renaissance person really means a number of sort of interlocking things. One is sort of this
*  polymathic implication, right? That the last person to know everything, right? The other one
*  is to to realize that there is a great benefit to being interested in the humanities if you're a
*  scientist and vice versa. Right. And the third is just a particular, as I said before, intellectual
*  critical stance that you take with respect to everything that you do. And they're not unrelated
*  in so much that you're more likely in my view to take a critical stance if you happen to be curious
*  in across a number of domains. Right. So I'm always struck, you know, by reading in the Times
*  Literary Supplement, a very cogent, quite short book review that seems to be far more analytical,
*  critical than most scientific papers that I read. Right. That this ability to praise see,
*  to be cogent, to, to construct an argument, you know, it's just not taught as well in science
*  as it is in humanity. Right. I mean, that's the irony of all this is a critical thinking is taught
*  better in the humanities than it is in science. And, you know, that's a conversation we can have.
*  So I think that if you want to have a curiosity, worrying, doubting stance towards your science,
*  then the humanities help because in the methodologies, that's not present. Right.
*  There's a lot more certainty and closure in methodologies. You either know how to do this or
*  you don't. Okay. And that, and that expertise can fool you into thinking you can be an expert
*  at science. I don't mind being called a stroke expert. I am a stroke expert. But if someone says
*  to me, you're a neuroscience expert, that seems very odd to me. I don't feel like an expert at all.
*  Right. I feel like somebody who's just worrying and trying to, you know, understand things. So it
*  just seems to me that you wouldn't call a novelist an expert novelist. It just would be odd
*  to say something like that. So I think it's just a difference in the stance, right. Which I think
*  is the most useful notion of the Renaissance. But I do want to add to that. The cultivation
*  of the critical eye can occur even just through reading literature. So I make a point to read a
*  lot for fun as well. I enjoy reading. And I have found that my creativity and my analysis and so
*  forth are benefit greatly from these more creative kinds of works of art from reading.
*  I completely agree. I think I completely agree. And there is some work on this. Is it reading
*  novels is a real way to do better science as odd as that sounds. You know, Richard Rorty in his
*  best book, I think, talked about this from another perspective, you know, how to be an ethical thinker
*  read novels, right. And he had a brilliant essay on Nabokov where he talks about this.
*  So but I think it's more that than trying to just go through an enormous pile of must read books
*  out of context. That's almost impossible. John, I wanted to ask you this. I don't think I've ever
*  asked you this. And for fear that it's going to take up too much time. It doesn't matter. I'm
*  going to ask you anyway. And, and David, I'll ask you the same sort of question in a different way.
*  John, I'm wondering what your medical training how you think it has interacted or benefited you or
*  giving you an edge or a different cut that you maybe I don't know if you see see something missing
*  in other neuroscientists or whatever that, you know, that your medical training has helped you
*  with. I mean, do you think that that has helped you or even hindered you, but your medical training?
*  No, it's actually really interesting question. I actually was at a meeting at SFI about a year
*  and a half ago where David, my brother, David actually mentioned that. And I thought about it
*  a lot recently. I do think that especially doing stroke neurology, where you see the effects
*  of modularity in the extreme. Right. Has definitely given me an advantage. You know,
*  I hear people talk about embodiment and, you know, the inactivist mind and, and talking about,
*  there's no such thing as specialized areas of the brain and all this kind of nonsense, quite frankly.
*  And I think that is extremely grounding to spend 25 years looking after neurology patients. And I
*  used to talk to this actually took with Oliver Sachs, who I knew. And we would talk about this,
*  that people who had opinions about how the brain works or about cognition, who never ever had any
*  experience looking at what happens when cognition goes wrong, or what happens when particular parts
*  of the brain are affected. And so I think it leads to a kind of denial of the fact that the brain
*  is where the action is for the most part, especially when it comes to cognition
*  and this notion of modularity. So I would say that I found it increasingly grounding. And when
*  you read someone like Tim Chalice and the work that he's done beautifully talking about, you know,
*  neuropsychology and what the lesion approach has taught us about the brain, and how neural
*  recordings has not done, in my opinion, as good a job as lesions have so far, right, it's actually
*  fascinating that lesions seem to do something heftier in terms of what you see than interpreting
*  recordings from the healthy brain. And Chalice writes very beautifully about this is can we
*  substitute the lesion based pathology approach with the healthy recording approach. And in my
*  view, and actually, he mentions this, it doesn't cut nature of his joints so far as well.
*  Yeah, but John, you and I, of course, in our paper, we make the argument that it depends on
*  what you mean by sort of single neuron recording or brain recording. Oh, yes, I would I mean,
*  just to say that to get onto the paper, I would say that it may well be that we're entering an
*  era where neural recordings of some kind in healthy brains can begin to give the massive
*  amount of insight that lesions provide. So to answer your question, because I've seen so many
*  behavioral consequences of lesions, consistently, by the way, it's not idiosyncratic,
*  and done a lot of experiments in patients, whether it's cerebellar ataxia, Parkinson's disease,
*  stroke. Yes, and I don't mean this in a modest way, it gives me a huge advantage, actually.
*  I really do believe that. And I thought that more. And, you know, and David was one he said to me
*  completely, you know, in this meeting, he said, John, it's interesting that when people say things,
*  you come up with a patient example, which is incredibly undermining. Yeah. Each time people
*  make a certain statement, he says, you know, I have no axe to grind, I don't want to agree with
*  you. But I find it really interesting that they'll say something quite ethereal and abstract. And
*  then you'll talk about dissociations in patients. And it's kind of devastating. Right? It's something
*  you're going to have to deal with. It's concrete. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. So you see it as a long term
*  investment more than a cost. I absolutely do. I mean, obviously, as David said, you know,
*  could one have spent, you know, time coding or becoming better computationally? Yes. You know,
*  it is in the end a zero sum game. But I think that if you want to be conceptually deep and worried,
*  I think you have to look very carefully at what's in front of you.
*  David, I don't want to have you for something to add to that. You can I was also just going to ask
*  you if you think that your philosophical training has given you an edge and the nature of that edge,
*  if so. Yeah, I think it has in the sense that I'm able much better to synthesize results.
*  It's a very important aspect of philosophical work is bringing things together and comparing ideas
*  and concepts and views. So I think it's had very tangible benefit in that regard. And then
*  I think to go back to something that John was talking about earlier, it's had a real impact
*  in my willingness to just not believe what I'm reading and to really question interpretations
*  of data. So as my neuroscientific training proceeded, I went from reading the entirety
*  of journal articles, sort of puzzling through everything to focusing on intro and discussion
*  to a much more mature position where I focus on methods and results and being very skeptical
*  of interpretive action and in these papers, interpretive writing, which oftentimes is in
*  the introduction and discussion. And so and that has come about, I think, because I'm much more
*  willing to say, they keep using this term used inference earlier, it is not easy to define what
*  an inference is. It's one of those funny terms that get thrown around that can mean a lot of
*  different things to a lot of different people. So that's a good example where that might occur
*  in a paper, for example, on Bayesian coding in the brain, visual cortex, let's say, and we'll talk
*  about inference and I'll say, I don't really buy this story because this is a term, it's really a
*  filler term that it can take on different meanings for different readers. And I think I'm much more
*  willing to call that out in my own reading and my own annotations and what I'm reading and to
*  and to sort of deconstruct positions and to try and dig down and say how much of what they're
*  saying really turns on this funny notion here that's not well defined. And then the next
*  step then is, okay, what are they actually doing? What did they actually find? And that's where you
*  get this focus on methods and results. And then you can say, okay, here's the tangible
*  output from this study. Here's their interpretation, but it has all these conceptual issues.
*  And of course, John and I are of the opinion that there has been a recent flowering of conceptual
*  issues and it pays to pay attention to some of them. That is a great segue, I believe, to talk
*  about the paper, which is a, let's see, how do I introduce this paper? So I would say that the
*  paper is a very high dimensional foray into these concepts. So therefore, I'm going to
*  give my lowest dimensional possible summary of it, which is completely unfair. And then we can go
*  from there. So my lowest dimensional summary of the paper is that it is yay for dynamical
*  systems theory approach and let's detach function mental properties neurally from structure
*  and the low level circuitry of the neuroscience. I just went high dimensional there.
*  Let me, I'm going to go, I'm going to stick with low dimensional,
*  yay for dynamical systems theory approach. How is that too low dimensional?
*  I think that's not a bad catchphrase slogan, as it were. I think there are some fine issues here
*  that we need to pay attention to. You said in your initial more high dimensional recapitulation that
*  it's against structure, but for dynamics. But I actually think that structure is one of these
*  funny terms and there's sort of the structure of neurons or the structure of networks,
*  but there's also dynamical structure. There's state spaces, there's features of the way that
*  systems move through those state spaces and that deserves to be called structure. And actually,
*  there's big debates in philosophy about what exactly is structure, material structure,
*  what does it mean? And this raises some issues about, can you actually cash out this difference
*  between the dynamics of things and their material properties? And I sort of fall on the side of not
*  really, anytime you measure anything, you're registering a change, for example, or no change,
*  which is a certain kind of change. And that Bertrand Russell made the point that we don't
*  really know what the sort of intrinsic properties of matter are. We only know the properties of
*  matter insofar as matter can impinge upon other matter or has other effects. And as a result,
*  it's not clear that there really is a substantial sense in which you can distinguish between
*  structure and dynamics. And so I think for those two reasons, there's dynamical structure,
*  as well as the fact that what we typically think of as material properties really do reflect
*  dynamics or changes or something of that nature, that the distinction doesn't have a good grounding.
*  Yeah. See, that was very high dimensional, what you just said. And I think that that's unavoidable,
*  right? And so this paper is because of its high dimensionality, because of its synthesis
*  and drawing on a lot of philosophy and drawing on really heavy concepts that are unfinished business.
*  And you guys operationalize terms and define terms as you go, but keeping those,
*  your particular definitions and conceptions in mind while you go, it is a slow going affair.
*  And there's, what's the, what are the kids say? It's a lot. That's what the kids say these days,
*  right? Isn't that the phrase? It's a lot. Yeah. So just to like zoom way out, what would you say,
*  and you can both chime in here, I should be a better host and ask one of you specifically,
*  but it's a discussion. So what would you say is the take home claim from the paper?
*  Well, I'll just go quicker because I know David, you know,
*  we'll have more to say to fill in. I think there are a number of things. First of all,
*  just to finish the conversation just had, I do think it's important to distinguish between
*  sort of population doctrine ideas. In other words, you don't have to invoke dynamics
*  per se to be able to derive interesting properties from populations, just like you can from neurons.
*  And of course, there's dynamics in single neuron data. That's what the peristimulus time
*  histogram is, right? So, you know, I think it's important to absolutely accept that there's a
*  very important role for considering dynamics and trajectories in population level analysis,
*  but not to conflate them. Okay. In other words, that's one thing. The points are,
*  if we're going to worry about thinking cognition, and you have to say that there's something
*  different between thinking and moving, and that there's something about the neuroscience of moving
*  that isn't going to easily extrapolate to the neuroscience of thinking. And that one's going to
*  have to, you know, from the outside in, well, what is thinking, you know, as David said, you know,
*  what kind of representations does one have to invoke? One has to talk about intentionality.
*  One has to talk about models of the world that are detachable from a stimulus. In other words,
*  one has to think more about what sets cognition and thinking apart from the sensory motor system.
*  And actually, to your point about me seeing stroke patients, I can tell you that I see uncoupling of
*  those systems all the time. The best example is when the diving bell and the butterfly was written
*  by the editor of French Elle, Dominique Bobie, where he had a pontine hemorrhage and was locked
*  in and wrote an entire book. Right now, he couldn't move at all. Right, but he could write
*  an incredibly beautiful book. Okay. And all I'm saying is whatever we end up understanding about
*  how he wrote that book, it's going to require some extra thinking from how he lost his ability to
*  move. All right. So that's the first thing is accept that there's something about
*  Kahneman system two versus Kahneman system one, which I will flagrantly say a lot of movement
*  is system one thinking a system two. So that which we start with and then go, okay, based on a bet
*  that David and I had, what kind of neuroscience is going to give us the best insights, intuitions,
*  concepts to think about that difference between the cognitive system and the sensory motor system.
*  And the argument is that the Hopfieldian view, this idea of population level phenomena,
*  right, which have dynamics are going to be the best way in to this particular puzzle
*  when it comes to cognition. So it was really that and then to say that the Sheratonian
*  approach, which seemed to work very well as Sheraton used it in the soleus muscle of the
*  decerebrate cat to study the stretch reflex, isn't necessarily going to be as fruitful as a
*  first level explainer when it comes to these cognitive attributes that we talk about. So it's
*  really that what is thinking does cognition deserve extra features? And then what kind of
*  neuroscience is going to help us have a feedback loop between the behavioral data and the neural
*  data? And that's what this paper is really about. So I think that it would be, so I'm going to
*  diverge from John here. So I don't think that the distinction that we're talking about is really
*  driven by system one versus system two, whatever it's empirical merits may be, whatever its
*  hypothetical status may be. I think that there's habitual cognition that requires sophisticated
*  manipulation of representations in as full-blooded a sense as you want. So I think that would be
*  system one cognition, full four cognition. I think there can be system two that is non-representational.
*  And so I do think that the cognition, that the system of system two distinction is orthogonal
*  to sort of what we were trying to pick up on. And I think it is the existence of certain cognitive
*  faculties and our ability to flexibly manipulate representations that is the driving question
*  behind our study. And I think what our study, our paper, and I think what we argue is that
*  in order to address these sophisticated cognitive faculties, we really do need these new resources,
*  these new concepts, this new way of thinking about brain data to address.
*  I mean, just to be clear, I disagree with that view. In other words, I think that once you,
*  what I do agree with is you can have a lot of system one cognition. That's what the whole
*  book was about, right? In other words, you cross the street as a white person when a person of
*  colors walking towards you, that is a system one cognitive mistake, but it's no longer
*  representational in my view. It's just a cashed non-representational policy that you now have,
*  a racist policy. And I actually think that it's only useful to think about representations when
*  you overtly, deliberatively consult them and use them rather than just now trigger them like any
*  other. Yeah, but I think that cognition is a type of internal behavior. And I think the values that
*  embody our aims and our goals during inquiry can augment and change the direction in which
*  our cognition unfolds, even to the deepest level, even to inference, even to the sequences of mental
*  states that are purportedly logically connected as a result of one mental state seemingly supporting
*  another. That is a completely value-based kind of internal sort of behavior that can be completely
*  unconscious. So there's bias, not just in action, but in inference and thought pattern. And I see
*  no other way but to suppose that that is representationally driven. So that's why I
*  have that view. But John, I don't think you and I have ever debated system one versus system two.
*  So this is interesting to know. That's absolutely true. I think that what I'm saying is that,
*  and it is somewhat orthogonal, that I think that to the degree that we are worrying about
*  cognition, I think we're worrying about something where you're overtly, you know, it's intentional,
*  you're consulting a model of the world. I do think that you can have intelligent reflexes all
*  the way up into cognition. And it's interesting to me that whether, you know, a reflex way of
*  striking your backhand or reflex way of thinking about something, I'm not so sure that they're that
*  different. But where I do think they're different is when you start getting into this overt,
*  intentional use of a representation. But it may not matter hugely to this debate,
*  but my guess is that there is a difference between a cognitive reflex and an overt,
*  deliberative process. This is an interesting distinction. I mean, I don't know if you want
*  to go down the backhand essentially example to talk about this, but you know, it makes me think of
*  going back to our automating, right? Automating when we were talking about learning science and
*  prematurely automating concepts. And the difference when you're doing a backhand in
*  flow state versus doing a backhand when you are intentionally thinking about it and it screws up
*  your backhand, right? So is this an area where, and I may be getting way too far ahead of ourselves
*  here, is this an area where representational thinking, what you guys would posit as representational
*  thinking, crosses over and affects the cognitive reflex type thinking? Does that make sense? Does
*  that question make sense? First of all? So I think representation could, I mean,
*  maybe this is more of the disagreement between John and I, but I think representation can play a role
*  even in this sophisticated backhand as opposed to when you're learning how to do a backhand.
*  For the listeners, let's just define representation the way that you guys defined
*  it in the paper here, okay? What do you mean when you say representation?
*  Right. So representation is an internal state of the system that has content. It's about something
*  that helps to guide behavior, carries information about that, something in the world, but has more
*  sophisticated properties than just those two, carrying information and guiding behavior. In
*  addition, for example, representations oftentimes can occur in the system even in the absence of
*  things that typically cause them. That's this detachability property that we mentioned earlier.
*  And there's other properties that they have as well. For example, oftentimes in philosophy,
*  representations are thought to be able to be true or false or valuable in some sense, accurate or
*  inaccurate. And so that's another more sophisticated property of representation than the term or the
*  concept is typically thought to imply, especially as it's used in much of sensory motor neuroscience.
*  So when we talk about representation, we're not just talking about any internal state of the system
*  that helps to mediate behavior and can carry information about the external world. In addition,
*  we're talking about these more sophisticated internal states that can be manipulated inside
*  the system that are about things in the external world that can be evaluated for truth or false
*  hood or other types of properties. They can be accurate or inaccurate, and that can occur in the
*  absence of their typical stimulus typically. So this is a more sophisticated sense. It's much
*  more philosophical of a notion of representation than typically occurs in discussions in neuroscience.
*  But we think it's necessary in order to tackle these really sophisticated cognitive phenomena.
*  For instance, an example I like to use has to do with planning a vacation. And planning a vacation
*  oftentimes requires, for example, making a purchasing a plane ticket. And you have a
*  representation of a plane in your mind when you're planning this vacation. But there's no plane in
*  your environment right now that's causing that representation. So there's some internal process
*  that causes that representation even though you're not in the presence of planes. And of course,
*  there's a million examples of this type that we can use. You can think about things that don't
*  exist and so on and so forth. So there's a lot of sophisticated cognitive activity that goes on
*  that requires this kind of internal action, computation over internal structures in order
*  to explain. By the way, this more sophisticated notion of representation that we talk about in
*  the paper has caused no end of controversy when we've presented this material and lots of furious
*  debate. It's actually a very good example. This is very important here of where the philosophers
*  and neuroscientists confuse each other. Yeah, I can see that. It's actually very interesting that...
*  I mean, let me just give another example that I can think help. If you walk into your front door
*  and you walk to your kitchen, okay, you just do it. But if I asked you, Paul,
*  right now, tell me how many left turns you take when you walk in the front door of your house to
*  get to your kitchen. Right now, you're going to have to use a representation, right? You're going
*  to have to think about the out your house, you're going to have to imagine yourself walking through
*  it. And you're going to have to answer, you're going to have to do a computation on that
*  representation, which is count the number of left turn.
*  I actually have to simulate it.
*  Yeah, you're going to have to simulate it. Whereas that's not the case when you walk into
*  your house and go to the kitchen. You've cashed what you do, you use cues, you don't have to use
*  a representation like that. That is a vast difference. Okay. And that is what this is about.
*  Now, it's very interesting that philosophers who have tried to naturalize their views of
*  representation and stick to the neuroscience, what they do, in most cases, and there are
*  exceptions, is they strip the interesting aspect of representation, this simulation,
*  down to impoverished anemic versions of representation, which is a state that maps
*  isomorphically onto some aspect of the environment. Okay. Neuroscientists also have
*  that impoverished view, right? It's just some correlation ultimately. Right. So it's very
*  important to realize, interestingly, that in an attempt to get into the neural data,
*  the interesting aspect of representation, which is this full blown simulation that you
*  effortlessly can do, which we haven't the slightest idea how that happens, by the way,
*  no clue, right? But we want to have a clue. And again, what this paper is about is perhaps that
*  ability for you to simulate in your head the number that your house and then do a computation
*  of that representation, the number of left turns, right? That's what we want to understand. And the
*  bet we're making is that you're going to have to have a Hopfieldian population level notion of it.
*  But let's just understand the normative of the problem and that we don't have a clue. Okay. And
*  that's what we have to admit. And is it fair to say that the modern dynamical manifold type
*  computational approach is, you would argue is our best bet toward a brain based explanation of how
*  those higher level representations occur? Yes. But just to be clear, right? I mean,
*  a lot of the nice work that's been done on population level calculations and dynamical
*  systems have been done in motor cortex, right? By Mark Churchland, where in fact, they're correct
*  to eschew the notion of representation. In other words, they're correct to say that you don't need
*  to invoke the notion of representation in that particular incarnation of a dynamical systems
*  view and a population view. That's an extremely important point to make is not every population
*  level analysis and trajectories and manifolds and subspaces implies representation of the kind that
*  we think you're going to have to invoke for thinking. It just may well be that some version
*  of that in the prefrontal cortex will do the requisite job, but one has to, this is just
*  a stepping stone. It's not as though that this level of analysis is field view is inherently
*  representation in the way that we want. Far from it. It's just that we just have a feeling
*  that that's going to be the form of the neural data which will get us there. It's a bet. We're
*  making an empirical bet that this way of viewing neural activity is going to be the way that
*  explains representations, explains the manipulation of representations that gives rise to intelligent
*  data. An interesting aspect of this is that this has been going on for, well,
*  it's increased in publications, for instance, this mode of analysis, but
*  it's sort of the, it has the high dimensional, the high number of neural neurons, population recordings
*  has naturally lent itself to this type of analysis that has now been going on for over a decade.
*  And I'm wondering what, so now, I mean, so you're satisfied that this is the type of
*  technology and recordings that will all of a sudden, now that we have this modern technology
*  that lends itself to these kinds of analyses, now it's a more satisfying account of,
*  I'm not articulating it well. It seems convenient, let's say, to say, now we have, this is the best
*  modern data and analysis that we have, and it's better. Right? And so that's why, you know, my
*  initial summary of yay for the dynamical systems theory approach is, it's kind of like saying,
*  yay, we're doing well, we're progressing. And I'm wondering what the, where the big step is.
*  It's just one thing, just one thing. I mean, it's just so important. I mean, a lot of people
*  in the dynamical systems view were anti-representational. Okay. So I think it's
*  dangerous in this discussion to, you know, and so were the original papers by Mark and Krishna,
*  right? They explicitly say in their papers that this is non-representational. So it's extremely
*  important to not confuse sort of the way to map the neural data onto these behavioral concepts.
*  And just to call it dynamical, I'm just worried because it's just, there is a
*  component of dynamics when you basically have transitions between states, but it's not an
*  anti-representational stance that we're taking. On the contrary, right? So it's just important.
*  In the history of dynamical systems is from the beginnings, you know, from Van Gelder was anti-representational.
*  Yeah. And that is just, and let me just be very clear. So I laid it to me, if you want to do
*  cognition and you don't have a representational stance, it's a non-starter in my view. It's just
*  a non-starter. I think David agrees. But that doesn't mean, and I just think a lot of people
*  are beginning to think that when it comes to cognition and the kind of representations that
*  cognition implies, that doing interesting work with the ability to record from many neurons
*  and the ability to do new forms of analysis on that is an interesting segue and a way in to
*  trying to understand this form of representation. It's, but it's, as David said, it's a bet, but I
*  think many other people are saying this. It's not just us. I think people are beginning to think
*  that this is the way to intuit how these representations are computed over by having
*  some neural data to look at. It's just a bet that it's going to give us insight.
*  But I'll add that, you know, it's the case that if I might be a little philosophy of science,
*  put my philosophers cap on that, the single neuron approach to understanding cognition
*  was really spinning its wheels for the past decade and a half or more. There was
*  marginal, seemingly marginal progress on certain issues, but not on these core complicated
*  aspects of cognition. Furthermore, the single neuron data that was being collected presented
*  this bewildering array of responses that didn't meet an easy story along the lines of previous
*  sorts of single neuron stories, what we call the sharing, Tony and view in the paper. So
*  what you have is not just this fortuitous development of new techniques and for recording
*  many neurons, new methods to analyze these many neuron recordings, but you have in the
*  traditional complement of techniques, something like a crisis state where you're not making the
*  kind of progress you would hope despite the huge sums of money and large data sets that were being
*  collected. And I'll also add that this new kind of approach, this new way of thinking about the
*  brain of analyzing many neuron, many single neuron recordings where you have many neurons
*  collected at the same time to get some, a better snapshot of the population has been productive,
*  especially in the past five or 10 years, not just a representation questions that have to do with
*  representation and cognition, as John pointed out, even in motor cortex has been tremendously
*  fruitful. So you have on the one hand, a relatively stagnant research program that uses these older
*  techniques and has a commitment to a sharing Tony and style explanation where you're detailing
*  individual neurons and the connections between them and what each individual neuron is doing.
*  I've heard it described as, as sort of like this anecdotal neuroscience where each neuron has a
*  little tale to tell about what it does to one where you have many neurons are being recorded
*  that have produced a novel insight into a range of cognitive as well as non-cognitive neural
*  functions. So I think, and that's productive. So unlike this adherence to this more old fashioned
*  view, there has been a productive research program. And that to me says, not just that this is the new
*  thing in town, but this is sort of what the doctor ordered that we really did need these kinds of
*  techniques and methods in order to make progress. And that's very exciting. I mean, this is, this
*  is actually really good news. And I'll add as sort of by way of Coda here, that it is not just
*  confirming these models that we have from other disciplines either. It's really providing novel
*  insight into how the brain is able to give rise to the intelligent behavior that's truly
*  representational and cognitive. Can you give a concrete example of that of a novel insight?
*  Yeah. So a lot of the recent research and publications that are coming out that have to
*  do with this kind of new Hopfieldian view where you're looking at neural populations and you're
*  looking at how the system traverses through that state space have provided insight into more complex
*  representations in the brain. And one of the main explanatory concepts is this notion of a manifold.
*  So that it's not like when you look at these population activity and you have thousands of
*  neurons, let's say they're being recorded, that the system occupies any point in this huge space
*  of possibilities. Instead, the system tends to occupy points that are on what's called a manifold,
*  sort of a restricted subset, a very restricted subset of the possible positions in that space.
*  And those subsets or manifolds that seem to carry these kinds of representational contents. And
*  there's nothing about any theories in psychology or cognitive science that say you have to use
*  manifolds or anything like this, but the brain does use manifolds. So I'd like to think of,
*  I like to conceptualize this kind of insight as a novel contribution. I'll add in addition that
*  there are ways of reading out where the system lies in these restricted subspaces on these
*  manifolds that is also providing a novel insight into cognition. So I love this one paper. It's a
*  beautiful paper from the Jazziery Lab at MIT. It's from Sohn et al. in the journal Neuron from 2019,
*  where they were investigating how the brain is able to keep track of and recreate intervals of
*  time. So the animals have to wait through an interval of time. And then when they're signaled
*  to recreate it, they kind of have to forego moving. They have to inhibit their movements until
*  they think an equal amount of time has elapsed at which time they respond. And in addition to
*  these kinds of manifolds that I was describing as representing the interval of time, the readout
*  of where the system is on that curve sort of low dimensional structure, that manifold,
*  actually seems to inform how the system recreates that interval. And it does it by determining how
*  fast the system traverses through another state space in the subsequent epoch where the animal
*  in the subsequent period of time where the animal has to indicate how long they thought
*  the interval of time was. And that they call this neural speed. Right. So label and but there's
*  again, there's no theories in psychology about time estimation or response times that appeal to
*  neural speed or speed of neural trajectories. So there you have an internal variable that seems
*  to explain this relatively sophisticated, maybe not fully representational in the sense that John
*  and I have been using, but more sophisticated than other types of tasks, cognitive function
*  that doesn't appeal that really does give us novel insight into what the brain is doing. So that's
*  sort of the example I like to use. And and we think that's the right step. This is the way
*  that we're going to need to explain more sophisticated, more complicated cognitive functions.
*  And also a number of things, you know, here I am at the scientific Institute, I mean, you know,
*  physicists have no problem whatsoever with the notion of emergence, neuroscientists,
*  stupidly, in my view, always assume that emergence means this spooky version, which no serious
*  physicist believes in. So in other words, this is just a need for education on the part of
*  neuroscientists. The point is that we've known there's a physicist actually here at the scientific
*  Institute says, you know, the 20th century biggest achievement was to realize that the physics of
*  individual objects and the physics of interaction between objects are different disciplines.
*  They are okay. And they may require very different frameworks to understand. And if you think,
*  therefore, that you get emergent properties from the interaction between neurons that are connected,
*  and that that and it's very interesting what David said when he said use that representation. In other
*  words, it's very important that the nervous system from the inside is using that simplified
*  subspace to do work. It's not just us epistemologically as scientists from the outside,
*  just simplifying things for our sake. And this is not a new concept. Computer scientists have
*  known this for a long time, that in a hierarchical system, you omit details so that you can do control
*  with a simple object, right? Not the computer scientists, and it's not the computer scientists,
*  the computer does that. Okay, so in other words, once you take this notion of emergence,
*  and interactions, which generate objects, which are the control objects for a hierarchical system,
*  and the physicists have known this and the computer science have known this for ages,
*  it's not that new a concept. Murdad, actually, you know, I agree completely with with David,
*  and I think it convinced me that there was a clue and intuition that could be given by looking at
*  these intervals in this state space. Murdad himself in one of his articles talks about the
*  fact that if you want to understand how a clock works, and you want to actually design a clock
*  so it works for itself, you need to have things like cogs and springs, these emergently shaped
*  objects that you construct a clock with. You don't talk about the atoms that make up the springs or
*  the cogs, that would be a very strange way to design a clock. So Murdad himself makes that point,
*  that these are not just epistemological objects to explain how a clock works to your friend,
*  this is the type of object that you need to construct a clock so that it works. And all
*  we're saying is that aggregate emergent properties lead to ontological objects, which the system
*  uses from the inside. And that is not something that is news to people outside of neuroscience.
*  So the so the low dimensional manifold type objects, the neurodynamical objects that you're
*  talking about. Another word, I don't think that you've used this word yet in talking about it,
*  is constraint, which is important in hierarchical systems as well. What I want to ask about is the
*  independence of these higher level representation dynamical objects versus lower level single
*  circuit more closely associated with reflexes and motor actions. And where that line is,
*  and the reason why I brought up constraint is I'm wondering if you see the lower dimensional
*  manifold type structures as a constraint with which to do computation within the rest of the
*  population of neurons, etc. I'll start with the constraint part of that question, because I think
*  that's absolutely correct. I think what's going on here is that these low dimensional manifolds
*  do constrain how the population evolves over time and and subsequent computations that are performed,
*  they are in one part of state of their state space, and they transform, they either move
*  somewhere else in that state space, or they get transformed into another state state space. But
*  it's it's in a way that's best explained by the constraints that are imposed by residing in these
*  low dimensional structures in the high dimensional space. So I think that that's entirely an accurate
*  description of how computation proceeds in the cognitive brain. Now, the first question had to
*  do with the relationship between the independence of like, so if we were is there a clean break
*  between the higher level representation, you know, and how the and then I'll just throw in,
*  how does the meaning get in there? How does the intention the aboutness, right?
*  As I say, the relation between the single units and let's say these population level structures
*  are these are these more sophisticated structures. Is that what you meant? I mean,
*  I had two questions there. One was, are you asking about the relationship between single neurons and
*  populations? Or were you asking about the the independence between cognitive representations
*  and sensory motor ones? Which one? Really, the independence between what I'm so I'm avoiding
*  the sharing Tonian and hopfield in labels, you may notice I don't don't find them useful. So I'm
*  avoiding them, because I find them to be more frictiony than anything else. But but that's what
*  I'm kind of wondering is like, where the where the you know, what is the nature of the independence
*  between these types of computing, let's say. So I think it's going to depend partly on what
*  you're trying to explain here. So if you are engaged in an understanding of the reflex,
*  it's entirely okay to restrict consideration to these kinds of sensory motor, yeah,
*  nodes and connections, sort of representations, I think there's great explanatory benefit.
*  As you sort of get deeper and deeper, so to speak into the cognitive, as you are considering more
*  sophisticated sorts of representations, then you're going to start needing to appeal to
*  these more sophisticated neural structures. Do we do we know where that line is?
*  I don't. So I have had this question posted to me before. I'm of the opinion, I'm not sure
*  what john's opinion is, but I'm of the opinion that it's not clear there really is a line. I
*  think there's going to be gradations of cognitive function that are going to sort of there's a
*  spectrum and some cognitive functions, imagination, narration, planning, they might require actually,
*  planning, it seems like maybe doesn't require such sophisticated things. I think it depends on the
*  type of planning. But now, but there are going to be these more sophisticated cognitive functions
*  that are going to require these more sophisticated types of explanation in terms of neural spaces,
*  of dynamical objects in the brain, and there will be less sophisticated instances of cognition.
*  But what you would you guys argue for a clean break, though, so that you can have these mental
*  thoughts that are separated from your more motor sensory systems. There, that's why I'm asking
*  about the independence, right? So what you just said is that there's a gradation, potentially.
*  But what you argue for in the paper, I believe is a clean break between them so that you can have
*  these higher level mental properties, I may totally be misunderstanding though.
*  I just want to be, you know, there are many things being slightly conveyed here. I absolutely do
*  think that there is, you know, and I think, you know, this has come up a lot in in linguistics,
*  you know, I think Tom Scott Phillips has written beautifully about this, which is that there is a
*  difference between language and communication, not a gradation, a difference. Okay. And a lot
*  of people get confused. In other words, the gradation argument can get us into a lot of trouble.
*  And that gradation argument comes from both evolution, you know, because you have to think
*  there's sort of modification in on a continuum. And it also comes from the fact that in the end,
*  it's all made out of the same stuff, right? In other words, prefrontal cortex and motor cortex
*  are made up of very similar elements. And therefore, how could it be that there's this
*  qualitative difference in what we think the representations are for cognition versus what
*  they are for motor. And yet in the end, whether you have an evolutionary argument or stuff argument,
*  there's a continuum. Again, no one in physics has any problem with this at all. Right? They
*  talk about phase transitions, they understand qualitative differences.
*  Yeah, but my point wasn't about gradation in the nature of representation. It was about gradation
*  in the nature of the cognitive functions and which properties your representations need to have are
*  going to be conditioned on relative to the cognitive function that you're describing.
*  But I do think there's a day, you know, there's wonderful, you know, I use this in the book I
*  wrote three years ago about what Sherrington, interestingly enough, noticed in his chimpanzee
*  that he gave a big sensory motor ablation to. And he beautifully describes in a paragraph in
*  that paper from 1917, the huge uncoupling between the cognition, the desires, the plans,
*  the intentionality of the chimpanzee, and its consistent surprise that it had all these intentions
*  and then its arm wouldn't move. Right? And he actually points out that you've completely
*  uncoupled this non-cognitive system from a cognitive system. And you see it all the time
*  in patients, right? Apraxia patients cannot imitate or use tools properly,
*  but their mistakes are perfectly executed. Yeah, so they're independent. I mean, the fact of the
*  matter is that they can be completely independent. If that's the question, then there's no question
*  that you can have ablation of sensory motor representations, but maintain your cognitive ones.
*  Absolutely. I know that behaviorally, they can be independent. What I'm wondering about is like
*  within these neurodynamical objects, right? Where does it start becoming useful to talk about
*  manifolds, right? To talk about lower dimensional representations as useful tools for thinking
*  about higher mental properties. Because in the end, I mean, the vision is right, that we can,
*  and correct me please, because I'm sure I'm wrong. The vision, what I gather from the paper,
*  the vision is to have little shapes, little trophy shapes that we can put up on a shelf
*  and point to and say, that's worrying that Timmy is going to fall down the well. That's what that
*  looks like, right? On a cloudy day or something. And then you have like all these different shapes,
*  and I'm sorry, this is a very simplified example, but I'm just trying to make it really concrete,
*  that then you can look and say, look, that's the way that that looks in manifold space.
*  Yeah. So I'll say that worrying that Timmy is going to fall down the well is going to look a
*  lot like worrying that Brenda is going to fall down the well. So you have this sort of swapping
*  out of representational content, but they're going to lie along these manifolds and you'll
*  just be in a different position along the same manifold. But it's going to be dramatically
*  different sort of neuro-functional space from hoping that it will rain tomorrow.
*  Hoping that Donald falls down the well. Let's say that.
*  Donald falls down the well.
*  You're going for a different orthogonal. Yeah, nevermind.
*  Yeah. I was going for something. Sure. But it's a different attitude, hoping it's going to involve
*  different computations over those representations. And so you'll have a different transformation.
*  You're going to have different manifolds and so forth. This idea of, so when is it useful
*  to talk about these Hopfellian spaces? I think that just depends on what you're studying. So
*  if you're studying, and let me be clear about this, when you're studying, hoping that it's
*  going to rain tomorrow, you're not thinking about things that are happening in your immediate
*  sensory motor environment. And so you are not going to get any explanatory purchase.
*  If that's your explanatory goal, that's the thing you're trying to explain is how I can hope for
*  future events. It doesn't help to pay attention to what's going on right around you. Your thoughts
*  are directed at, they're about things that haven't occurred. They're not in your immediate
*  environment. So there's some sort of decoupling that needs to occur between the neural systems
*  that support that kind of activity and what the activity is about, what the contents of the
*  activity are. And we maintain and argue that that is where the Hopfellian view is really going to
*  come to be useful. And I think that it's not just a theoretical claim, although we do make
*  some theoretical arguments, I also maintain that there's good empirical support that the kinds of
*  things that we're able to explain now and increasingly so, and the kinds of questions
*  that cognitive neuroscientists are tackling, especially in the past five or 10 years, are
*  yielding to these methods more than they were to these other types of methods, to looking at
*  sort of stimulus bound input output transformations by circuits in the brain. That's just not going to
*  give you that kind of purchase. Now, which cognitive functions do you, if I'm just studying reflexes,
*  okay, I'm sharing Tony, and if I'm studying imagination, okay, no question, I'm in the
*  camp of the Hopfield. Where in the spectrum of cognitive functions does that transition occur?
*  That depends, I mean, I'm not sure. I don't have a good answer. You know, I think some cognitive
*  functions have placed more and more, place more representational demands on the system and place
*  more sophisticated representational demands on the system than others. And so,
*  I'm just not sure there's going to be like a clean cutoff between those two.
*  I would just, I would actually be a bit more extreme for the sake of, you know, we're seeing
*  whether it's work on hippocampus, whether it's work on temporal lobe, whether it's motor cortex,
*  in other words, that's, you know, object recognition, which we don't call cognition,
*  motor cortex, that it seems as though when you get into cortex, you're in a slightly different
*  neural regime than you are in the brainstem or spinal cord. And it may well be that the aggregate
*  behaviour of lots and lots of interconnected cortical neurons exploited neural tissue in a
*  qualitatively different way that yields to these kinds of analyses that we're talking about.
*  Okay. And so, and again, it's just a bet that if we're going to get to the kind of representations
*  that we posit and important for cognition, just like we're getting real traction from motor cortex
*  and hippocampus using population level approaches, that's going to be what yields the special source
*  for cognition. It would be very odd to think that when you go from M1 to pre motor cortex,
*  to prefrontal cortex, you suddenly become Sheratonian again, right? It would be very
*  strange. And if you look at Mark's recent work on SMA versus motor cortex, it's actually very
*  interesting that he has to invoke representation for the SMA where he subjects it to the same kind
*  of analysis, because you actually have to represent the order that you're going through in action.
*  It is not important in motor cortex. So I would say that he's showing that this extra piece of
*  representation, the order of the upcoming sequence is present in SMA and is not present in M1.
*  And so you've got a lovely juncture between a representational population analysis in M1
*  and a non-representational analysis in M1 and a representational level analysis and some trajectories
*  that are very intuition building in SMA. So it's not that, you know, you take from 30,000 feet,
*  it's just saying that once you get into cortex, it seems like this approach is yielding a lot of
*  fruit that is not happening if you try and say neuron A is connected to neuron B is connected
*  to neuron C and kind of intuit the computations and representations by following the sequential
*  transmission of information through specific connections. It just doesn't work.
*  Not only does it not work, it gives us insight into why we even have cortex. Why don't we just
*  have these series of serial transformations? Why do we need these complex prefrontal cortical zoo
*  with all these, you know, bizarre menagerie of neural responses? And I think it's because the
*  functions that prefrontal cortex or cortex more generally serves are more sophisticated. They
*  require this kind of substrate that can support these neural functional objects, these hapliolian
*  type spaces and manifolds. So it gives us insight not just into what these areas are doing, but even
*  why these areas exist and because of the representational and functional demands that were placed on.
*  And I've mentioned before, you know, Yoshua Bengio and others have actually written a paper,
*  AI Needs a Prefrontal Cortex. And Bengio talks all the time about system two missing from AI.
*  It is right now. So in other words, isn't it interesting that the AI people are now talking
*  about the importance of the prefrontal cortex? They are also saying we don't, Bengio will say
*  we've got system one worked out. So in other words, there's this convergence of awareness
*  that there's something extra that can be done in these structures in cortex. We're having a clue
*  about how to analyze cortical data outside of prefrontal cortex. And now perhaps that same
*  train of thought is going to re-yield just like Mark, I think, is beginning to show as he
*  transitions from M1 to SMA. Then you have pre SMA, which is considered honorary prefrontal cortex,
*  and then into prefrontal cortex. It just seems to me a good bet that this approach is going to
*  give us intuitions. I can't see honestly, and this could just be my limitation, how it's going to be
*  otherwise. I don't think anyone would disagree with that. Or maybe you disagree. Well, hang on,
*  let me back up. We have like 10 minutes. So I want to make sure we talk a little bit more about AI,
*  if you guys have more thoughts about how this approach could benefit or what's missing in AI.
*  And maybe we should just focus on that, but just given the limitations of time,
*  unless there's not a lot to say about it. Because, you know, John, you just mentioned that
*  people, and by people you meant Benjio, and there are others talking about system two,
*  consciousness prior. Sorry, I can't help but kind of laugh when the word consciousness is just
*  thrown around in there. So what prescription do you think this approach can provide for AI
*  that might be missing right now? Is the Benjio approach it, or is there more to it?
*  So I think that AI may need to move away from a focus on nodes and connections. And you're
*  seeing this certainly in a lot of these analysis of deep neural networks, more towards understanding
*  their functionality in terms of state spaces and manifolds, and these kinds of hopfilling objects
*  and a greater concern placed on more complex and perhaps less discrete aspects of neural activity.
*  I mean, I would go so far as to say they may need to move away from thinking of nodes and weights as
*  all that needs to be included in so far as these networks want to be biologically inspired. So as
*  we say in the paper, we speculate that it might turn out that spikes and neural activation is
*  really epiphenomenal and that what's going on is we're just getting a readout of this hopfilling
*  and neurofunctional type object and that it might be implemented not just by neural activity, but
*  by all kinds of other types of electro activity in the brain by large biomolecules and so forth.
*  And maybe that's the kinds of signals that AI needs to start to incorporate. And I know that
*  there is an active research program that's trying to do that. I will say this, which might be more
*  surprising. AI is really operating, I think, with sort of fundamentally different material.
*  Obviously, it's in silico and it might be that given the nature of human manufactured computer
*  processors that you're able to do a lot more than you can with sort of our evolutionarily
*  constructed neural processors. And it might be that they're going to be able to do things.
*  In other words, they're going to be able to have cognitive or cognitive-like behaviors,
*  even if they do restrict themselves to a more nodes and connections type view,
*  just because the processes that they're working with are so fundamentally more powerful than the
*  ones that biology has endowed us with. So, you know, is this intelligence, is this real cognition?
*  It may not be. We might have to start to sort of brook other notions of intelligence besides the
*  biologically inspired one in order to understand the way that these systems operate. But that's
*  very speculative. You used the word decoupled earlier. And let's focus on that for a second,
*  because, you know, vaguely in my head, right, I can see in a deep learning network,
*  if you can somehow decouple these higher level representations from the underlying circuitry level
*  representations, that that, you know, I thought you might be going there.
*  Just to say something about that, I mean, I think what gets confusing here, and, you know,
*  is, you know, there are so many ironies here, right? Good old fashioned AI was very much
*  worried about these kind of issues, you know, symbols and common sense and reasoning,
*  literally reasoning, right? And then it moved away. And we had these deflationary projects,
*  there was connectionism, right, which was anti-representational reinforcement learning,
*  you could say some people an update of skin area and behavioralism, right? So in other words,
*  there was this very interesting move away from the original problems. And now it's coming full
*  circle, right? And there's this sort of need, whether it's Benjio talking about prefrontal
*  cortex, Paul Smolenski saying we have to sort of combine gophi and connectionism. And where
*  it comes down to is connectionism as eliminationism versus connectionism as implementational, right?
*  Now, obviously, at some point, second level explainers are going to be about connections
*  between neurons. No one's denying that we certainly aren't. But what we're saying is,
*  is there some emergent object that is a first level explainer. And as we argue in the paper,
*  and others like William Ramsey have that it's very difficult to get the representations you need for
*  cognition inside individual nodes and connections, right? And so there's going to have to be some
*  mapping between implementational connectionism and the kind of dynamical, you know,
*  neurofunctional object that actually can break free of those constraints and actually do work.
*  And lots of people are worrying about this. Paul is particularly eloquent about this.
*  But everyone is going to just have to admit that this is a problem. And not just think that we can
*  just deflate it by ever better attempts at the connectionist project.
*  I mean, this is why our view is an empirical bet, right? We're not making a first principles kind
*  of argument against a sharing tonian network, being able to do something cognitive. It's rather
*  that it's very difficult to get the kinds of transformations over representations that you
*  need to explain cognition merely by appeal to nodes and networks, especially when you have noisy
*  neurons in the brain. But, you know, when we've moved to in silico neurons and, you know,
*  in silico connections and the kinds of precision and so forth, then it's a, for me, it's an open
*  question about whether or not you can make that progress. I would still make the empirical bet,
*  just as John did, that you need AI to shift as well, that it just doesn't make sense. It's hard
*  to see how that kind of approach could yield success. But so I would make that empirical bet
*  for AI as well. What is the shift that needs to happen? Because you still have to build a
*  network. So you have to implement it in some architecture, right? Right. So I think one of
*  the, and actually, I think there are some analyses of neural networks, I can think of Robert Yang's
*  work, for example, that's really great, that analyze neural networks from a dynamical systems
*  perspective, the state space perspective, seeing how different areas of the state space have
*  different structures that can support different types of cognitive function. And I think that's
*  the shift you're going to need to use. And what you're going to see is that potentially a shift
*  away from, let me, you know, I don't work in AI, so I'm going to be very speculative right now,
*  but it could be a shift away from a consideration of error propagation through back towards, you
*  know, the different nodes as a result of, say, performance on a task that depends on what you're
*  optimizing, what your error function is. But you could imagine that instead of doing that,
*  we're going to try and propagate error on the basis of, I don't know, try to replicate a certain
*  kind of state space, let's say, or something like that. So that would be a real concrete difference
*  where your error function that's going to define the error that you propagate back is going to
*  differ, it's going to change from like a task optimization to, let's say, a dynamics optimization
*  or something like that. That would be, but I don't work in this field. So for all I know, I'm, you know,
*  that's happened. I don't know. I mean, they're worrying about this a lot. But you know,
*  you had Yuri Hassan on your program, right, Paul? Where he talked about, you know, this direct fit
*  approach. And, you know, he said, you know, you can do a lot of intelligent, as Daniel Dennett calls it,
*  competence without comprehension. You know, you can show intelligent behavior by basically just
*  training up these neural networks and you have such a big data sample that you can get by in life
*  just by interpolation, right? But he admitted in his paper and on your show that when it comes to
*  cognition, this flexibility, this extrapolation, he had no idea. He just admitted that this approach
*  would not get you there, right? So in other words, we're just at the same aporia, whether we're in
*  neuroscience or whether we're in AI, I think it's delicious that we're exactly at the same gap in
*  both professions. We don't know how to get this rich representation, either in silico or understand
*  it in neuro. And I don't think that's a coincidence. I think it's because we're up against the same
*  problem, right? And we're going and I don't know who's going to win the race. Is there going to be
*  some sort of evolutionary algorithm at open AI or deep mind where suddenly, oh my God, this thing is
*  thinking or there's going to be a more principled approach using the Hopfieldian approach where one
*  begins to see what's required to get thinking. I don't know. One thing I can tell you, whether it's
*  going to be the Hopfieldian approach in big cortical areas or AI, I think they have a much more,
*  they're much more likely to succeed than going down into an insect and being sharing tonian
*  and calling it cognition, finding some kind of circuit motif that you can call microcognitive
*  and then somehow imagine you can extrapolate from that. So the three projects, I think we would
*  argue that doing principled Hopfieldian neuroscience on primates, for example, or doing work in AI,
*  worrying about system two like Benji is, is more likely to yield answers to cognition of the kind
*  we are positing than being sharing tonian in a very small model system. So guys, this conversation
*  has been very rich. It has not scratched the surface of the paper. So I apologize. We haven't
*  gotten to so many other things with that, guys. I really appreciate it. Sorry, I know I've taken
*  you over, but carry on the good work and we'll catch up again. I'm so grateful for being on. And
*  yes, thanks for having us. And it's been, it's been awesome. Yeah, it's been a very fun conversation.
*  And thank you, Paul, for being, you know, so good, you know, in general with the two of us today
*  and basically being almost like a psychotherapist to my sketch. Very, very, very grateful. Okay.
