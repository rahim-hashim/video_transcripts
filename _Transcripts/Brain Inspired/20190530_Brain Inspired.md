# BI 036 Roshan Cools: Cognitive Control and Dopamine
**Brain Inspired:** [May 30, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XxSy5rcQ30)
*  One of the questions that is particularly pertinent is what limits cognitive control?
*  What makes us so limited?
*  Why do we fail so often to exert control?
*  So we've got dopamine soft, right?
*  Do we?
*  I mean, it's so horrendously complex, these systems.
*  It's unlikely that with thinking, we deplete some kind of metabolic resource in the brain
*  At least we haven't discovered what that metabolic resource will be.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hey, welcome everyone.
*  This is Paul Middlebrooks.
*  And today my guest is Roshan Kules.
*  So Roshan runs the Motivational and Cognitive Control Lab.
*  She's at the Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behavior.
*  She's also a professor of cognitive neuropsychiatry.
*  This is all at Radboud University in the Netherlands.
*  And in her lab, she largely studies how neurotransmitters or brain chemicals affect our higher cognitive
*  functions like motivation and cognitive control.
*  So on the show, she talks about cognitive control as a meta-control function, that is
*  controlling how we go about deciding whether and when to spend cognitive effort versus
*  going on a sort of autopilot.
*  Not just in our actions that involve motor responses, but also in our thoughts that involve
*  functions like working memory.
*  This can be thought of as a trade-off between stability and flexibility or maintaining a
*  state of focus versus allowing new information to enter when it's necessary, like when you're
*  changing the task that you're working on and so on.
*  And we talk about the story of dopamine, which is all the rage in the reinforcement learning
*  world, and a well-known part of that story in neuroscience.
*  So we discussed that well-known story of dopamine, but Roshan and others' work has
*  shown that dopamine is involved in cognitive control as well, and we discuss its involvement
*  therein.
*  Roshan is the second guest I've had who will be giving a keynote address at the Cognitive
*  Computational Neuroscience Conference in a few months, and you can learn more about that
*  at ccneuro.org.
*  It's going to be an awesome conference, so you should submit a paper and attend is my
*  suggestion.
*  We talk about what she'll talk about in her keynote address at CCN.
*  We also talk about how AI is just starting to pay attention to neuromodulators and their
*  function.
*  We'll speak a little bit about being a woman in science, and a lot more, of course.
*  And of course, you can find the show notes with links to whatever comes out of our mouths
*  during the show at braininspired.co.
*  slash podcast slash thirty six.
*  OK, thanks for listening.
*  This show continues to be a joyful challenge for me.
*  Getting to talk with people like Roshan just makes it so worth it to me.
*  And I hope it is joyfully challenging you.
*  And I'm wishing you the perfect balance of dopamine in your brains.
*  Please enjoy.
*  Roshan Cools.
*  Roshan, thank you for joining me on the show today.
*  Hi, Paul.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  I could go full on Dutch and go Roshan, Roshan.
*  But you've already corrected me and just told me to say Roshan.
*  So I will.
*  Very good.
*  So you run the Motivational and Cognitive Control Lab at the Donders Institute for Brain,
*  Cognition and Behavior and the Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging.
*  And this is it.
*  Rodpo University.
*  Speaking of where you work, I had Marcel van Gerven on the show.
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  Two months ago.
*  Do you and he cross paths often?
*  Oh, yeah, regularly.
*  We haven't collaborated yet, I would say.
*  But yeah, we share sessions and the Donders is kind of unique for its collaborative atmosphere.
*  So we see each other regularly.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, good.
*  He was fun to talk to you, actually.
*  So tell him I said hi.
*  OK.
*  There's someone else you should say hi to, my friend Bram Zandbelt, who works for you.
*  So I knew Bram.
*  We were postdocs together at Vanderbilt University.
*  And I know that Bram and his family are huge fans of Zwarte Piet or Black Pete, the crown
*  jewel of the Netherlands.
*  Right.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's a sensitive issue, you know.
*  I hear that's what I understand.
*  Well, tell us who Black Pete is or Zwarte Piet.
*  Oh, well, Zwarte Piet, although we're not really supposed to refer to him as Zwarte Piet now.
*  Oh, I'm sorry.
*  And in fact, they are often pink or yellow or white or any color.
*  But they are the helpers of St. Nicholas.
*  And St. Nicholas visits us every year on the 5th of December on his birthday from Spain.
*  And he comes with a boat full of little gifts for all the kids.
*  And the kids sing.
*  This is Sinterklaas.
*  Sinterklaas, yes.
*  That's right.
*  And his Black Pete, that's the story.
*  But yeah, there's a lot of uproar about that now in the Netherlands.
*  So sort of famously, there are a bunch of people that walk around in blackface dressed
*  up as Black Pete, right?
*  That's right.
*  And is that the controversy?
*  Yeah, that is the controversy.
*  And then half of the country is thinking that this is sort of a ridiculous worry because
*  clearly he's black because he has to go through the fireplace to get to the fireplace.
*  That's why he's black.
*  He's covered in soot.
*  Oh, my gosh.
*  I didn't know that.
*  OK.
*  But yeah, so and it's like a tradition.
*  So people are upset about this being now no longer allowed.
*  But the other half of the country or maybe the majority, I'm not sure about proportion,
*  is thinking that it's time to update this tradition and that we can no longer sort of
*  work with this old model where the helpers really represent slaves from Africa who would
*  help Sinterklaas to bring the gifts.
*  So well, I guess there is some sort of balance between tradition and progress.
*  And part of what we're going to talk today is about balance with dopamine in the system.
*  So maybe that's a good segue to move on here.
*  That's right.
*  So your main focus, Roshan, is on the major neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin
*  in the brain and how they affect our motivation and our cognitive control or willpower, if
*  you will, and what's happening when these neuromodulators aren't are non-optimal in
*  situations like Parkinson's disease and so on.
*  And lately, if I have this right, you've been focused on bringing two stories about dopamine
*  together.
*  One is the story about dopamine in a reward-based choice and the other story is the story of
*  dopamine in cognitive control.
*  And we'll talk about what all that means throughout the show here.
*  But would you like to add to what I just said about what you do?
*  No, I think that's pretty accurate.
*  So we have an interest quite broadly in these ascending neuromodulators and most of the
*  work is focused on dopamine, but there's also a parallel line of work on serotonin, which
*  might provide an interesting motivational opponent, some have argued, of dopamine.
*  And of course, our interest also kind of broadened out to the other systems such as noradrenaline,
*  but most of my empirical work and also my thinking is focused on dopamine.
*  So that's right.
*  So yeah, this is a world, you know, the chemicals in the brain is a world that I'm not well
*  versed in.
*  Can we just, before we really kind of get into things, can we just zoom way out and
*  think about neuromodulators for a second from an evolutionary perspective here?
*  So AI these days, like deep neural networks, really doesn't incorporate neuromodulators
*  into their work.
*  I mean, there's very, very, very little work being done on this.
*  And I'm sure I'm going to get backlash for saying that, but like deep learning nets,
*  you know, or neural networks or whatever, they start with neurons or neural units as
*  the basic unit of computation.
*  Now way back before there were multicellular organisms, you had these single-celled organisms,
*  you know, swimming around in this bath, you know, and they communicated via chemicals
*  that they would excrete or chemicals in the environment or that they would secrete.
*  Okay, and then so fast forward and the single-celled organisms become multicellular organisms and
*  chemicals are still the rule.
*  Within the organism, cells are still communicating via chemicals.
*  And now in nervous systems, chemicals are still the rule.
*  You know, even the action potentials are mediated via chemicals in the synapse.
*  So that's kind of a long introduction to ask, is it off base to think of neuromodulators
*  as communication signals between cells that have since been kind of co-opted to modulate
*  the activity of like a little population of cells, you know, like a population of neurons,
*  right?
*  Or what is the right way to think about this from an evolutionary perspective?
*  I think that's actually quite a good way of thinking about it.
*  So it's important to make a distinction between these classic neurotransmitters that transmit
*  these messages between neurons and these large ascending chemical neuromodulators, which
*  really serve as a mechanism of dynamics.
*  So these systems, these networks in themselves with their connections are fairly fixed.
*  Of course, both biological and artificial networks, they have to adapt to our environment.
*  So the way I think about these neuromodulators is that they allow us to adapt and they allow
*  the system to adapt flexibly to the constantly changing environment.
*  And they do that because of a variety of reasons.
*  They indeed provide a way for these neurons to communicate that I think we should start
*  thinking about in AI indeed.
*  And people have started, of course.
*  So this is a bit of a different show for me, you know, because we usually jump right into
*  the AI discussion, you know, so and hopefully we can talk a little bit about that.
*  But we're going to spend some time talking about your research and also talk about things
*  related to the Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Conference, where you'll be delivering a keynote
*  talk, many moons from now in September in Berlin.
*  So Roshan, you gave a great TED talk a few years ago about the need for society to trust
*  science and especially basic discovery based science, arguing that some of the greatest
*  advancements in science have resulted not by trying to advance a particular thing, you
*  know, like you're working on the problem to advance and then you advance it, but rather
*  that they emerge from the work being done out of curiosity about other things.
*  So I encourage people to check that out.
*  Of course, I'll link to it in the show notes.
*  But what I want to ask is what is it like giving a TED talk?
*  Is it just another talk or is it a completely different experience or what?
*  Well, it's a completely different experience, really.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, the whole preparation for, of course, it was a TEDx talk, right?
*  There's a difference between these TEDx talks and TED talks.
*  It's the same format, right?
*  That's right. And it involved the kind of serious preparation and training.
*  Yeah, there's lots of rules, right?
*  You have to stand on the circle and you're not supposed to move much.
*  And yeah, there's hardly any slides and there's an extensive, you know, review of the actual text.
*  Yeah, it's very controlled.
*  Oh, so you memorize the text and you really go.
*  I mean, you have to because you have to finish in time and the timing has to be right and all that jazz.
*  Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
*  Yeah. But even the way you have to stand is like regulated.
*  How do you have to stand? We'll just talk about that.
*  You can't move.
*  I think the rule is to stay still.
*  Yeah. And so there was a number of training sessions.
*  Go ahead. Talk about cognitive control.
*  In which I was told not to move my hands.
*  Yeah, exactly. Well, it's physical control as well as cognitive control.
*  Well, that's a good distinction that we'll get into here.
*  And also, and I'm trying to convince my wife of this still, I don't know why it's hard to convince her,
*  but at the beginning of TED talks, when you watch online, they put a clap track at the beginning.
*  As I said, everyone's giving you a standing ovation before you speak.
*  And so people aren't giving you a standing ovation before you speak, are they?
*  No, no.
*  So, OK, so you're going to give a keynote lecture here in a few months at the CCN.
*  I know it's really early to ask this, but do you have broadly some possible topics that you'll be talking about there?
*  Yeah, sure. I mean, the plan is to to talk about this observation that the human brain faces,
*  the number of these tradeoffs that I've talked about previously,
*  these computational tradeoffs such as the one between focus and flexibility,
*  make the observation that these large ascending neuromodulatory systems are particularly well suited to regulate these tradeoffs dynamically.
*  And I will make that point by illustrating a number of general principles of chemical neuromodulation,
*  like baseline dependency, opponents and regional specificity.
*  But that's a that's a very abstract summary, I guess.
*  More concretely, I'll present some of our recent work in which we've combined pharmacology and chemical PET,
*  in which we measure dopamine directly in the brain using these radio tracers in terms of uptake of tracers as well as fMRI,
*  using a number of cognitive tasks and and model based analyses.
*  So it's that combination of techniques that we apply to the overarching question,
*  which is really a cognitive one and which is what limits human cognition.
*  So that's really my ultimate interest.
*  Curiosity is about what makes us fail to exert cognitive control so so often,
*  what makes our ability to exert control so limited despite the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with that ability being so well developed.
*  Right. Right. So, I mean, at the conference,
*  your specialization really is, like you just said, coming from more of a cognitive neuroscience side.
*  And you'll be presenting at this conference where they're trying to bring together cognitive science, neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
*  Do you have a sense of how these three sort of disciplines can best work together?
*  Yeah. So that's a bit of an abstract question, right?
*  Sure.
*  From my perspective, we've we've been inspired and influenced a lot by people who've built more formal models of some of the ideas we have had,
*  but not worked out so specifically.
*  So in my interactions with modelers and people from AI,
*  I'm inspired and also encouraged to break down the problem in a way that I am not when I interact with other experts,
*  for example, psychiatrists or or psychologists or neuroscientists or a neuroanatomist or physiologist.
*  So I have several collaboration with people like Michael Frank or more locally here,
*  starting to interact with people from the AI department.
*  And I always feel that this is particularly productive once you actually engage in a direct collaboration on the work floor.
*  So where you really design the experiment, the empirical work together based on a formalized theory and where you actually run these model based design and run these model based analyses together.
*  But I'm not sure that's the answer to your question at the level of.
*  Well, so I mean, during those that kind of collaboration, I mean, collaboration is so important.
*  Do you feel like, for instance, with Michael Frank or whomever when you're working with a modeler, is the communication really freely two ways?
*  Do you guys inspire each other or is it more you're learning and they're implementing or how is the.
*  No, I think I think it is really two ways.
*  And the interaction with Michael is maybe quite a nice illustration of that and also our historical interaction.
*  So we actually first met on a conference when he presented the model of some of our empirical findings in Parkinson's disease,
*  where we showed that dopaminergic medication has these detrimental overdose effects on reversal learning on this type of flexibility,
*  which he then sort of. Yeah, I was inspired by to build this this model, which then was so successful.
*  His his work then inspired us to to follow up some specific questions in which we addressed using this combination of pharmacology and PET.
*  And we involved him and analyze some of the work with some RL models.
*  So it's really a two way interaction, I would say.
*  And even today, we're running these complex, highly complex pharmacological multimodal imaging projects.
*  And for example, we have a joint postdoc, excellent postdoc, Andrew Westbrook, who spent a year in our lab,
*  who's currently in at Brown in Michael's lab.
*  And we're on Skype every week, every month with the three of us.
*  Oh, cool. And it's a very.
*  Yeah, I would say it's a very mutual learning experience.
*  We have a different look on things.
*  Yeah, and Michael is not the only person I interact also with with other people.
*  Like we've done quite a bit of work with Quentin, who's and these are quite specific people where I do feel that
*  the the ability to lay some empirical foundations under of these theoretical ideas provide this mutual ground.
*  Yeah, it's like scaffolding to build your own ideas further.
*  It's a beautiful thing.
*  Yeah.
*  So is there something when you attend the CCN in particular,
*  is there something that that you feel like you might want to take away from that conference or are you looking forward to?
*  Well, I guess the question is probably answered in a very similar manner.
*  I mean, we what I hope is to get an overview of the current state and to be inspired by.
*  I haven't been previous years.
*  You know, thinking back to all the conferences that you've been to,
*  and I know you go to even more these days than you have in the past because you're speaking and being invited to them.
*  Can you think of like one of the best, quote unquote, moments that you that you've had at a conference?
*  People talk about scientific moments, right?
*  When you make a discovery and things like that.
*  Can you think of one of the best moments that you've had at a conference that's really inspired you or or led to something?
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, there is the there was a wonderful meeting.
*  I can give a specific example that maybe the general point first, of course,
*  if you go to a meeting with a particular aim or such as you have a vague a new interest,
*  that's sort of vague in a new topic, but you go with that topic in your mind.
*  And for example, SFN, a meeting like SFN is so large and that's the only way to get anything out.
*  I had that experience last year when I when I went there with a quite a specific novel interest in the back of my mind.
*  And I felt quite satisfied when I was able to kind of obtain lots of new input on that particular topic.
*  So so far, I've focused, as you know, mostly on on the costs and benefits of of cognitive control.
*  More recently, I've started to be interested in assessing whether we can begin to leverage commonalities or maybe
*  bridges between this cognitive control field and the cognitive mapping field that are known from spatial navigation and memory.
*  I just had Tim Behrens on. So this is OK.
*  Yeah, exactly. Tim's work has very much inspired me recently and might be surprised language.
*  So, oh, no, yeah.
*  So NAMI is is kind of well known for its extend, you know, large community of linguistic scientists or neurobiology of language.
*  And, you know, after being here for more than 10 years, I'm starting to be influenced.
*  Just being very, yeah.
*  And that with that sort of general aim in mind to see how to bridge these three fields of
*  cognitive control, decision making on the one hand, cognitive mapping on the other hand,
*  and the problem of inference in language really was sufficiently vague to be easily satisfied.
*  Yeah, yeah. But yeah, I can talk a bit more about that.
*  But maybe a much more concrete example of a very defining moment was a conference,
*  a little conference organized by Todd Braver and I can't remember now.
*  It was in Washington, St. Louis.
*  A wonderful meeting on the motivation of cognitive control in 2013.
*  And that now, if I look back, has influenced a lot of my work in the last few years.
*  So actually, Andrew Westbrook, who I just mentioned, who's doing this joint postdoc between Michael and myself,
*  was a PhD student at the time in Todd Braver's lab.
*  And Todd was presenting his interesting novel work on cognitive effort discounting.
*  In that case, I mean, that's a very specific type of conference.
*  But were you, so you were there focused, you know, sort of on your own field, really, right?
*  So did you have like a specific moment where you're like, oh, oh, I see, you know?
*  Yeah. No, I think that was a defining moment, that meeting where until then I had to work,
*  I had these parallel lines of work where on the one hand, I studied dopamine,
*  the prefrontal cortex, working memory, task switching, these kind of higher order cognitive processes
*  was influenced a lot by these attractor landscape models of prefrontal dopamine.
*  And on the other hand, this work on reinforcement learning and the basal ganglia.
*  And I think it was probably around that time that I thought, ah, maybe it's worth to think about
*  these two roles of dopamine in the striatum and the prefrontal cortex and to integrate them
*  and to consider that dopamine might well contribute to these higher order cognitive functions by
*  acting somewhat indirectly on the basal ganglia to alter the weight on the costs and benefits of
*  cognitive control. To some degree, that point had been made much earlier, of course, by Randy O'Reilly
*  and Thomas Hazy and Michael Frank in their gating models of working memory.
*  But to me, that importance of that point and the need to study it empirically became so clear at
*  that moment. Wow, that's great. Yeah. Well, man, I want to just start talking about that stuff,
*  but and we'll get there. But so CCN is a smaller conference and you're headed to, is it, are you
*  flying out today or tomorrow to go to Brown? Yeah, tomorrow. Tomorrow. You're flying out tomorrow
*  to go to an even smaller conference, I believe, specifically on cognitive control. And the moment
*  of inspiration you were just describing happened at a small conference. I mean, what, you know,
*  is there something special about like a smaller conference relative to something like Society
*  for Neuroscience where you have, you know, 20,000 neuroscientists there? Yeah. Yeah, of course, of
*  course, lots. The one thing is that it allows you to focus, I think. So, you know, at SFN, I tend to
*  want to observe everything that I can on all the topics. Yeah. Yeah. The opportunity cost is super
*  high. So it's impossible to focus. At these smaller meetings, you can have a conversation
*  and actually let it flow somewhat freely and not be stressed about all the things that you're
*  missing out on. Yeah. I think it's really about opportunity cost that's less salient in the
*  smaller meeting, that's lower. Yeah. You can focus a bit. I'm also really on the introvert scale and
*  I know there's a lot of ongoing research about introversion, extroversion, but in a situation
*  like Society for Neuroscience, I tend to just give up really quickly, you know, like you start
*  to sort of wander the posters and then from 20 feet back, you think, I don't want to engage in
*  that because that could, that's 30, it could be 30 minutes. Does that look like a 30 minute engagement
*  of my time? No, you wander on, you know, and then you just give up at a certain point. Yeah. That's
*  why it only works if you have this higher order goal in mind, which can sculpt your
*  selection. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's take a quick break. Relax your brain for a second.
*  Raunak, Alex, Adam, and NNMM or NN underscore MM. Thanks guys for deciding to support the show
*  through Patreon and continuing to keep me dedicated to figuring out what the hell we're all talking
*  about anyway, hopefully inspiring you in some way along your journey. All right. Time to flip
*  your cognitive control back into focused mode. Okay, cool. Well, Roshan, I want to know about how
*  to improve my cognitive control and I'm hoping that you can help me here today. So what is
*  cognitive control and how, I mean, I know you've contributed to changing its definition
*  over the years and recently and so what is it and how has its definition changed?
*  Yeah. Cognitive control is an ill-defined phenomenon, but generally refers to that
*  set of mental processes that enable us to obtain our goals by resisting distractions and temptations
*  and impulses. Your question, whether the construct has changed, yes and no. I think
*  one observation that we made is that control, exerting control can be both good and bad.
*  And so too much control is no good depending on the statistics of the environment. Too much focus,
*  too much stability, if you will, is inappropriate if the environment is very volatile,
*  if there's lots of new input that needs to be processed that require adaptation of behavior.
*  So at that level, too much cognitive control, if we define it in terms of focus, is inadequate.
*  Of course, we could argue that what we need is a form of meta-level cognitive control.
*  If we define cognitive control at that higher order level, you could argue that too much control
*  is never inappropriate. By meta, you mean a controller for the cognitive control.
*  Is that right? That's right. I mean, if we define our goal in terms of
*  optimal adaptation to a changing environment, then we can't have too much cognitive control.
*  So I'm interested actually to hear, Paul, what makes you think that I've contributed
*  changing the definition. So you've written about how in the past, cognitive control has all been
*  about implementing the control aspect. And what you've done, from what I understand,
*  has you've broadened it to include the flexibility aspect and brought that sort of within the
*  definition of cognitive control. And you can correct me if I'm wrong on that. But you've taken it from
*  where it's cognitive control, where we're all Dutch and all we want is just focus, focus, focus,
*  right? And you brought it out of the Dutch realm. So I've heard you talk about how much
*  control you like and how much control Europeans tend to like and how important focus and productivity
*  and things like that are culturally. But really, the other half of control is being able to
*  relinquish that control and bring in the new information. So yeah, so that's at a higher
*  level, I would say, then the type of control that we classically measure, I would say in the lab,
*  for example, with classic cognitive control tasks of Stroop or, or AgriStorm Flanker,
*  what this is gotten really illustrates is the need to be much more precise in the use of our
*  terms, right? Yeah, well, that's always the case. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's Yeah, I guess it's always
*  the case. But here, this illustrates quite nicely, I think, the use of this formal modeling approach
*  to some of these issues. Yes, we could specify cognitive control in terms of its meta level
*  requirement as being aimed at the higher order goal of adapting to a changing environment.
*  And it is true that our kind of insights that what we need is an ability to dynamically
*  regulate whether we are focused or whether we're flexible, that might have contributed to this
*  redefinition of cognitive control. What do you think the most critical or one of the most critical
*  open questions is about cognitive control? And or this this meta? What do we call it? Meta cognitive
*  Meta control? Yeah. Meta control. Meta decision making, meta control. I would say that one of the
*  questions that is particularly pertinent is what limits cognitive control? What makes us so limited?
*  Why do we fail so often to exert control? And it's not it's not a trivial question, as I said earlier,
*  I believe we consider control, cognitive control as a hallmark of the human brain. It's associated
*  with this kind of very well developed part of the brain. So why don't we use it all the time?
*  The other point to make here is that in contrast to effortful physical control,
*  effortful mental control, cognitive control is unlikely to be easily accounted for by depletion
*  of some kind of metabolic resource. At least, you know, the increase in bold signal with when people
*  perform complex cognitive tasks in the scanner is equivalent to the increase in bold signal
*  in the default mode network when we are addressed, for example, or when we conduct a complex
*  conduct, a simple visual task that in itself is not experienced accompanied by an experience of
*  of mental effort. So what makes us fatigued? What's the origin of mental fatigue? And
*  what is the cost of cognitive control is really related and related question to what
*  what limits cognitive control. And I think that's a tough question. And I think the answer to that
*  question might lie in a better understanding of these chemical neuromodulatory systems.
*  This is a fascinating, I mean, I think every every topic we talk about, I'm going to I'm
*  going to want to jump off and say, you know, how this could relate to AI systems, you know, and then
*  yeah, because it's sort of fascinating how it to think of how computer systems would compare,
*  you know, how how model AI systems would compare. But but but to address this, you know, this
*  limitation, why why we get fatigue? You know, what do we need? What do you think we need more of or
*  better of? You know, is it is it the technology? Do we need better technology? Do we need more data,
*  better models, you know, theories or something else? I mean, I know we need all of it. But if you had to
*  push for one, yeah, I would say so as I as I pointed out, I think the these these chemical
*  neuromodulatory systems are likely to play a key role and to provide an answer in part to this
*  question. But many of these ideas out there are fairly unspecified, underspecified. So I think the
*  first thing that's really needed here is more formal theories, formal models, that then generate
*  predictions that we can test with new techniques. PET is the only way to measure these systems in
*  the human brain and specced, but their spatial and temporal resolution is just horrifyingly low.
*  Of course, people are starting to to measure signals at a higher temporal scale with
*  voltammetry, for example, read Montague's published some really interesting work
*  on that, where measuring chemical signals from from patients with Parkinson's disease.
*  If we start to be able to do that more broadly, I think that has promise and to manipulate it. But
*  that's of course a far future. But if you ask me what's needed, then I think it's a combination of
*  investment in this formal modeling of these ideas plus advances in measurement and
*  manipulation techniques of these neurochemical systems. Because both pharmacology and PET are so
*  coarse. We really suffer from that. Is it so interesting to talk about these amazing
*  technologies and how terrible they are? Yeah. If I had to freeze you, right, if you were going to be
*  cryogenically frozen for a certain amount of time, and then you'd wake up,
*  how long would you want to be frozen for? That's a great question. And you can say a day, I suppose.
*  But given what you just said, I imagine it's more than a day. Yeah, in terms of scientific
*  advance. Yeah, I mean, well, you mean, well, I wouldn't want to be frozen at all.
*  Perspective of my kids. Yeah, your kids. Let's say, yeah, controlling for your children.
*  Yeah, I would say probably 10 years or so. Oh, wow, that's optimistic. Okay.
*  Yeah. But as I say, I mean, there are people already measuring these temporally very precise
*  signals, not directly in a model based manner. There's some inference involved there.
*  We're going fast, I think, manipulating those systems at that skill. That's a whole different
*  issue. Yeah. But some very interesting new stimulation techniques out there, which might
*  be promising. Well, in humans, especially, which is your specialization. So cognitive control,
*  like we mentioned a few minutes ago, or I mentioned, I suppose, used to be all about
*  implementing control and maintaining focus, you know, and the more the better.
*  And your work has shown that there's a balance needed between that stability of maintaining the
*  stability of maintaining focus in your working memory and in your attention when you're doing
*  these cognitively demanding tasks and instability, or, you know, what we can call flexibility.
*  What is the right balance between stability and flexibility?
*  Yeah, well, there's no sort of answer, straightforward answer to that. That depends
*  on the statistics of the environment. So if we're in a world with very many rewarding
*  alternative opportunities, then it's not adaptive, probably. It's not optimal to constantly focus on
*  one task. If the world is very volatile, then also we need to be more flexible than if the
*  world around us is quite stable. So the degree to which we need to invest in one versus the other
*  strategy really depends on all these meta parameters. So volatility, controllability,
*  I would say average reward rate, there's all kinds of aspects of the environment that determine
*  whether one state is better than the other. But you wouldn't want to be okay, so I mean,
*  we can talk more about this. And and we'll talk about prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia,
*  the striatum and how they interact to potentially provide these mechanisms.
*  You wouldn't want to be switching, you know, you don't want to be switching every tasks every 30
*  seconds, for instance. That's unhealthy, right? What I guess what I'm wondering at, and maybe I
*  can wait to ask this is, so you're focused on a task, right? And even if you're in an environment
*  where the statistics are such that you should be really flexible. So the mechanism of switching,
*  of flexibility shouldn't come online and like stay online, right? It should kind of come online,
*  and then you should switch tasks and focus. And then and that should be like the prolonged
*  state. Does that make any sense? That's actually a question.
*  So I'm not quite sure I'm following exactly what you're saying. But, but I think what you're saying
*  is that we should be to some degree flexible and stable at the same time. Well, so the flexibility
*  aspect is good for switching, right? It's bringing in new information, but then you want to bring in
*  that new information and then clamp down. And you don't want to be bringing in new information for
*  three days, right before you clamp down. So I'm envisioning a system where you're focused on
*  something and then, oh, it's time to bring in new information and potentially switch tasks or
*  whatever. And then you sort of open up the ability to be flexible, but briefly, then again, focus.
*  And that seems like the right balance to me, but am I off base there?
*  No, absolutely not. I think that's absolutely true, that we would want to continue to keep
*  certain representations online and then occasionally sort of gate new information in.
*  Yeah, that's the gating work that you were talking about earlier.
*  Okay, well, maybe let's move on and we'll come back to this. So many of my listeners
*  likely hear the word dopamine and they think, ah, that's the reinforcement learning chemical,
*  related to when we get an unexpected reward or we think we're going to get an award,
*  but we don't. The old prediction error. But I imagine few of my listeners have heard it in
*  relation to cognitive control. Could you, for us all, just give the quick and dirty overview
*  of dopamine in reinforcement learning, sort of like the quote unquote classic now story of
*  dopamine, and then talk about its role in cognitive control?
*  Yeah, so actually, like years ago, maybe in the 50s, 40s, we didn't consider dopamine to have a
*  cognitive role at all. This was changed in part by the seminal work of Patricia Goldman-Rekits
*  and Brzezawski showing that the completion of the prefrontal cortex leads to a deficit on delayed
*  response, like classic delayed response task, classic task of working memory, to almost the
*  same degree as those seen after complete ablations of the prefrontal cortex. Those were the first
*  pieces of evidence suggesting that dopamine does something else than being involved in motor control.
*  That was long before the RL story of dopamine, although there was the soon, not that long after
*  the pleasure story. That's the happy drug. The self-administration work. Of course, the success
*  of all of the dopamine RL story is very much grounded in the theoretical work by Peter Dayan
*  and Reed Montague, who kind of observed that the signals that were so famously recorded by
*  Wolfram Schultz from these dopamine neurons, which were active at the time of an unexpected reward
*  and which were depressed at the time of the omission of an expected reward, were so similar
*  or basically resembled that reward prediction error that played such an important role in these
*  learning theories. They made that observation that dopamine might carry this learning signal and
*  therefore be important in reinforcing behavior rather than simply serving as a pleasure signal.
*  I would say in the vast, vast majority of when dopamine comes up related to AI networks and
*  deep learning networks, it is in this context of the early reinforcement learning theories and work.
*  We've got dopamine solved, right?
*  Do we? It's so horrendously complex, these systems. We have this interesting RL signal
*  that we can detect from neurons. I think that probably is accepted now by everyone, although,
*  of course, there's also a lot of heterogeneity even at the level of the midbrain.
*  You mean among individuals?
*  Between individuals, but also within individuals. There's neurons that show this reward
*  prediction error signal, but there's also neurons who show a rather different signal.
*  There's still ongoing debate about the degree to which there is some structure in that heterogeneity.
*  You think 10 years. You think 10 years is when you'd want to wake up, huh?
*  Yeah, because I think there's lots of interesting movement going on right now.
*  Sure, you wouldn't be doing it otherwise.
*  I don't want to miss that. The point is that that signal that is well known at the level of the
*  midbrain projects to all these different regions. These different regions have different ways of
*  subsequently metabolizing the dopamine. In the prefrontal cortex, for example,
*  metabolism is really slow, so there's no way of that temporally precise
*  signal, prediction error signal, to be conserved. It's very hard for that temporal precision
*  to be translated at the level of the prefrontal cortex.
*  Dopamine is metabolized by comms rather than the dopamine transporter, which is
*  much more abundant in the striatum. That already shows that the effects
*  really depend on the target region.
*  This might be the right time to bring in the prefrontal cortex and the striatum story and
*  how it relates to what we know about what you know about dopamine and its role in cognitive
*  control. I know this is an ongoing story, but what is the prefrontal cortex and striatum
*  story with respect to dopamine and cognitive control?
*  Yeah, so really the observation that we made and others as well is that
*  people have thought about dopamine's contributions to working memory and cognitive control
*  in two relatively segregated sort of communities. There's this group of people who've thought about
*  dopamine's contributes to working memory in terms of a modulation of an energy landscape,
*  if you will, or the gain in an attractor landscape, changing the depth of the
*  of these energy wells by increasing dopamine and also noragenin. By the way, we changed
*  the signal to noise ratio of these working memory representations of these network of these prefrontal
*  memory networks as a result of which the kind of relevant or the most active representation becomes
*  becomes potentiated and amplified in the context of suppression of
*  kind of irrelevant working memory representations.
*  So is it suppression of the noise or is it amplification of the gain or both?
*  So the way that people have thought about this is an increase, if you will, of the
*  depth of the well of these energy as a result of which it is more difficult to
*  change this representation given new input. So it's less likely that new input will impact
*  prefrontal networks. This is work by Dershowitz and Siemens. And then in parallel that there's
*  this kind of alternative class of models which has talked about
*  dopamine's contributions to working memory and has thought about these contributions in terms of
*  a modulation of a gate, if you will. So it's altering the selection of new input or new
*  representations or the suppression of old representations rather than altering the
*  memory of existing representations.
*  And a lot of like what you have proposed and what you're working on is how, well, for instance,
*  if you take a healthy individual and let's say they have low dopamine in the basal ganglia,
*  like a baseline low level of dopamine in the basal ganglia, but they have normal levels of
*  dopamine in the prefrontal cortex for whatever reason, let's say this is a healthy individual,
*  and then you just give them dopamine, it's going to affect them differently than if they had
*  low levels of dopamine in prefrontal cortex but high levels in basal ganglia and so on and so
*  forth. So what is that story of how dopamine and the different levels in different areas of our
*  brain can affect our cognitive control?
*  Yes, there's two general observations that we've made. The first is that
*  a dopaminergic drug that increases receptor stimulation will have quite different effects
*  depending on the baseline state. So if the baseline state is low, it will improve the
*  function of that region. If it is high, it might overdose the function of that region.
*  Now, the other observation and we've touched on that just before is that the effect will
*  depend very much on where in the brain it acts. So if we have a system with high levels in
*  prefrontal cortex and low levels in the basal ganglia, we might increase the function of the
*  basal ganglia but detrimentally overdose the function of the prefrontal cortex.
*  And sort of the reverse story might apply to a system with low levels of prefrontal cortex but
*  high levels of the basal ganglia. So this has been a kind of an oversimplified way of thinking about,
*  for example, Parkinson's disease where dopamine levels are severely depleted in the striatum early
*  on but actually are relatively intact in the prefrontal cortex. If you increase dopamine,
*  we might see an increase in cognitive flexibility by increases in dopamine in the striatum in the
*  basal ganglia. But at the same time, that same drug might detrimentally overdose the prefrontal
*  cortex, which was relatively intact to begin with, and thereby interfere with a key role for
*  dopamine in that prefrontal cortex, which is the stabilization of working memory representations.
*  And this is at least what we see empirically is that dopaminergic drugs make people more flexible.
*  They can switch between tasks more readily. And we've seen that that kind of effect is associated
*  with modulation of the basal ganglia. But at the same time, you see that that same medication
*  can make people actually more distractable on working memory tasks. So one possibility is that
*  this represents a normalization, remediation of dopamine levels in the striatum, but simultaneously
*  an overdosing of dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. And this was interesting because it is
*  an effect that's in some sense diametrically opposite to the effects of say,
*  kind of analogous drugs like Ritalin, methylphenidate in ADHD, where what we think,
*  this is a little bit unclear, but what many people think is that ADHD is accompanied by
*  deficient catecholamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. So that methylphenidate might act primarily
*  to remediate dopamine or adrenaline deficiency in the prefrontal cortex, thereby rendering
*  representations more rather than less resistant to distraction.
*  And then we can do better on a test or studying.
*  Exactly. Then we can focus better, be less distractable. And in some sense,
*  that's directly opposite to what we see with dopamine enhancing drugs in Parkinson's disease.
*  So one way to account for these paradoxical effects of these dopaminergic drugs across different
*  people is by taking into account first baseline dependency, the fact that the effect depends on
*  where you start off and second on where in the brain that is the case.
*  Yeah. So if I just took a bunch of dopamine in hopes to perform better on something,
*  I might end up cheating on my wife more or going to the gambling boats or jumping off bridges
*  because I'm so flexible. Well, I guess that's what you see in Parkinson's disease, right?
*  That an proportion of people, they start to gamble as a function of these dopamine agents.
*  I've got to ask my grandma about this. She really just wants me to take her to the gambling boats
*  these days. So maybe we'll have to ask her about this.
*  Although, yeah, the degree to which you want to associate that kind of compulsive gambling
*  behavior with a sense of flexibility is a whole different issue.
*  Right. Right.
*  Yeah. We've actually recently, it's not published yet, but
*  obtained some really interesting preliminary data demonstrating that gamblers do exhibit
*  increased dopamine levels in the striatum. That's published.
*  Okay. They also exhibit compulsive
*  behavior on a reversal learning task of behavioral flexibility. So they're inflexible,
*  but paradoxically, somewhat paradoxically, the relationship between that increased
*  level of dopamine and compulsivity was negative. So that indeed increases in striatal dopamine,
*  which we think might be associated with increased inflexibility,
*  but actually protect against compulsivity. I'm glad you're working on all this and not me.
*  Yeah. It's so confusing.
*  Yeah, exactly. So you're saying the story is done and many people think the story is done,
*  dopamine does RL, does have it formation. It's not like that.
*  So Nora, do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?
*  Not at all.
*  Hard questions, okay.
*  Just a little bit hard.
*  Okay. Why do you think that my podcast is so boring?
*  Because it doesn't have like songs and stuff.
*  Well, that was going to be my next question is how to make it less boring.
*  Do you think just songs?
*  Yeah.
*  Like the Frozen soundtrack or Smallfoot?
*  Classic.
*  So much of like the theory about neuromodulation, and this is switching gears just a little bit,
*  seems to revolve around dictating what to allocate our resources to,
*  you know, because we got to do it before we become infertile and die, you know,
*  so we've got to like figure out, you know, we have this time on the planet,
*  we're made of meat and liquids and we're going to die.
*  I mean, it seems like, you know, as much or more of our energy is devoted to figuring out just what
*  to think about, what to spend our resources on, then is spent on the actual thinking about the
*  thing that we're deciding to think about, right?
*  You know, once it's decided.
*  And computers don't have this problem, right?
*  Except for in the time domain, you want a computer to go faster and faster,
*  but a computer is not going to die, you know.
*  We don't have infinite energy to feed a computer,
*  and I'm thinking about AI models now, right?
*  But for all practical purposes, we do, they don't need to copulate,
*  they don't need to, you know, they don't need to decide what to think about in order to make
*  themselves more fit and attractive evolutionarily, for instance.
*  I'm digging myself in a hole here.
*  But anyway, I'm good at doing that.
*  So it's getting better and better.
*  So the energy demands and, you know, consumption and limitations in brains
*  related to this stability and flexibility, I'm kind of trying to pit that against the potentially
*  limitless energy consumption by machines.
*  And I kind of want to just open that up for you to comment on, because I, do you have thoughts about that?
*  And maybe this will bring us into the broader questions about AI and how all this is related.
*  This is a very interesting observation.
*  I mean, and it triggers all kinds of thoughts.
*  And the first is that, the first point I want to make is one that I actually made earlier,
*  which is that it's unlikely that with thinking,
*  we deplete some kind of metabolic resource in the brain.
*  At least we haven't discovered what that metabolic resource will be.
*  So some people believe that that must be the case, and we haven't discovered which resource is depleted.
*  That we could then replenish, right?
*  That we could then replenish, exactly.
*  So that rather the cost of thinking is serving as a motivational signal, as a solution,
*  as an optimal solution to tradeoffs like the flexibility stability tradeoff.
*  This is an idea that's made, that's formalized actually by Sebastian Müslik and John Koehn
*  in some recent work conference proceedings, I believe.
*  In my own words, the cost of control might serve as a motivational signal to open our mind.
*  And that cost of thinking might have everything to do with these neurochemical signals,
*  which contribute to weighting these costs differently, or might compute these costs,
*  to some degree, regulate these costs.
*  The fact that this is missing in AI systems, I mean, those all AI,
*  also artificial systems face this tradeoff, right?
*  They face this all kinds of tradeoffs.
*  Give an example, like in terms of like what to work on at a given time,
*  like what problem to solve at a given time.
*  It's hard for these systems to be stable and flexible at the same time.
*  If a representation is maintained, it's hard to update it.
*  But it's interesting, just a side point for a second.
*  There's this kind of large initiative program here of the physics department,
*  interested in neuromorphic computing.
*  And their motivation is, in fact, the observation that the brain uses
*  so little energy compared with computers.
*  Well, that was part of my point.
*  We're going to have to worry about that in the future.
*  We are from an environmental perspective, right?
*  So hardware is just using up so much energy.
*  But it seems like so much of our evolutionary resources,
*  so much of what is programmed into us,
*  is concerned with energy consumption because it's so finite for us.
*  But theoretically, if we don't give a damn about the environment,
*  et cetera, about energy consumption, there's no reason why we would necessarily have to build in
*  a concern for energy consumption.
*  Let's say we…
*  Yeah, but so that's interesting, different way of thinking about the problem, right?
*  So this is assuming that the brain functions the way it functions
*  in order to conserve energy for, I don't know, reproduction or something.
*  But that's kind of starting from the assumption that the primary
*  purpose of the brain is survival, which is interesting, which is actually not likely.
*  But another way of thinking about some of these…
*  The origin of the computational characteristics of the brain is
*  because it allows us to adapt to its changing environment.
*  And that's how these AI systems and the biological systems differ.
*  So the observation that we can change our state adaptively,
*  sometimes be flexible, sometimes be stable,
*  also comes with deficits, right?
*  Well, so this is like a trade-off.
*  So you can think of narrow AI and very specialized systems that can do one thing
*  extremely well, like let's say a self-driving car or something that processes visual input
*  or something and detects stop signs or something like that, right?
*  I know that's not a great example.
*  But what we're talking about here with the neuromodulation and being able to
*  switch between tasks and be flexible when necessary is very much a property of our
*  general intelligence and probably is more important when we're talking about
*  artificial general intelligence, which is really what we're all
*  eventually talking about as being the more interesting case in building artificial intelligence.
*  So, I mean, yeah, the idea that there is this deficit, like you say,
*  that is just built in inherently.
*  It's an opportunity cost in itself to have to trade off, for instance.
*  And I don't know if you want to comment more about that.
*  And we're kind of going off the rails, which is great.
*  Yeah, but it's pretty fundamental.
*  So it's fun.
*  What I'm thinking about a lot these days is that it's about the purpose of these limits.
*  Our brains are limited because they solve the problem of adapting to this changing
*  environment.
*  You're coming from it from a slightly different angle and saying that
*  the computation, the meta computation itself is costly.
*  This is what it seems to me.
*  It's a necessary part of our existence.
*  And when we spend energy on it, our mitochondria spend a lot of energy on it.
*  Yeah, I think this relates to some of these ideas about the opportunity cost representing
*  this average reward rate of the environment, which can be accumulated
*  in a computationally rather efficient manner.
*  These ideas by Yael Niv and Nathaniel.
*  I'll be talking to Yael soon.
*  Yeah, although she won't probably be prefer to talk about that as much.
*  I wish you didn't have children.
*  I wish you had more time to talk today.
*  Well, this is my general problem.
*  What is that?
*  Is this is this constant competition between wanting to think more and stop and work out a
*  problem and achieve clarity and then just the pragmatic challenges of having more than 10
*  minutes at a time to think about something.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes, I have children.
*  I know.
*  I know what you're going through.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a constant sense of frustration.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But it's a beautiful, beautiful thing, right?
*  Right, Rashad?
*  Well, you know, when I just before in the year, just before I had my first son, I was so bored.
*  It was horrible.
*  I got allergic.
*  Actually, it's work.
*  So one thing that keeps me interested is the diversity.
*  Well, it certainly is diverse.
*  Yeah.
*  So, I mean, you have a seven-year-old now, right?
*  You just had a birthday.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  I mean, how much of a struggle has it been to you to give up some of your own control?
*  Well, they provide the kids, they provide the perfect training ground, right?
*  For letting go of control.
*  You cannot do anything else but let go.
*  We're scaring everyone at home, but yeah.
*  Are we?
*  We must be.
*  No, I think the kids have helped me probably to let go more regularly to switch tasks.
*  It's relaxed.
*  It doesn't mean that I'm always happy to let go of control.
*  You know, sometimes I prefer to continue to think about a problem for much longer.
*  But I know I can get stuck.
*  And as I said before, I had children.
*  I would continue to think even though it was no longer productive.
*  Sometimes it's good to let go, come back to it the next day.
*  The work, the representation stays active.
*  Yes, but my whole thing is that I need more than three minutes at a time to think about a problem.
*  And I mean, you know, if you're with your kids, you're not going to be working on problems.
*  So it's pretty fruitless to even let your mind go there
*  because then you're just going to be interrupted and frustrated.
*  I know what you mean.
*  Yeah.
*  Pretty soon, I'm going to be talking more in depth about ongoing challenges of being a woman in
*  science.
*  Do you have like a particular experience or any experiences that you'd be willing to talk about
*  that reflect the, you know, being that where being a woman has been a factor in your career?
*  Yeah, this is always a sensitive issue.
*  This I must say that I've not thought about the gender issue very much.
*  That's great.
*  That's great.
*  That's a great thing.
*  Yeah, I've not had to think about that.
*  Even though I've been one of the few women in many of the organizations that I've been also
*  now on various, you know, here at the donors, but also at other advisory councils.
*  And it's only most recently that it's starting to sometimes strike me the difference and
*  becoming a little bit more difficult or salient somehow.
*  Yeah, so far I haven't spent too much energy on the diversity, gender diversity issue, apart from
*  just being me.
*  And I noticed it has an enormous impact.
*  So most of my lab is female and I don't think there's anything specific about the topic that
*  would attract particularly women.
*  But so I do think people attract people like them.
*  So and because there are more men than in science, then that attracts more men, you think?
*  Is that the rule you're...
*  I don't know.
*  I do think that people apply to work with me, maybe unconsciously, because I'm a woman.
*  Of course, that means that you're a lesser PI because you're a woman, right?
*  You can't lead people and you're actually you're probably not as smart either, right?
*  Right.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You know, I've never I've never been too sensitive about this.
*  You know, I've benefited to some degree from we had a quota here for professorships and I was
*  appointed as part of this quota and I'm not embarrassed about that.
*  I'm also not.
*  Oh, like a yeah, that's like a, you know, quota.
*  It's like, yeah, like an affirmative action sort of thing.
*  It's an affirmative action.
*  Sorry.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  So our dean decided that, you know, we now it was high time at our medical faculty,
*  I'm appointed as psychiatry to appoint women.
*  And so I was part of that.
*  And I think that's good.
*  I noticed how it's a vicious circle.
*  You know, if you don't have women in top positions, people won't consider it even possible.
*  Other women won't consider it possible.
*  When I didn't have kids, I had my PhD student tell me they didn't want to stay in academia
*  because they didn't want to have no kids like me.
*  Oh, my gosh.
*  That's not a good note to end on.
*  Okay, let me ask you one more science question and then I'll let you go because I know you
*  do have kids and you have to get along.
*  What is something that you used to believe?
*  And this can be about cognitive control or, you know, your field or science in general
*  that you consider naive now?
*  Many things.
*  I'm here all day.
*  I can do this all day.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, in relation to what we've talked about, I think
*  there was a time that I thought that smart drugs, so-called smart drugs like methylphenidate,
*  could not possibly act like true smart drugs because they necessarily bias the system to
*  one state at the expense of another.
*  Because it's a zero-sum game, right, in the brain.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But actually, right now, I think that that was naive and that that observation is precisely
*  the reason why they act like smart drugs.
*  Can you elaborate?
*  Yeah.
*  It's a bit of an abstract point, yeah, but take an environment that's extremely volatile,
*  that has high opportunity costs, lots of rewarding alternative opportunities.
*  According to one hypothesis, that state is associated with high baseline levels of dopamine.
*  If you now administer a drug, you might overdose a system.
*  It's important for cognitive stability.
*  That's exactly what you want in an environment that's extremely volatile,
*  that has high opportunity costs.
*  You don't want to focus too long on one task.
*  It's a mechanism to adapt to an environment that has certain demands.
*  So you envision a time when we can do this at will, huh?
*  Well, I don't know if that's what I would conclude.
*  I think the system might be organized in such a way that it self-regulates itself
*  so that it's adaptive to our environment and that some of these drugs act in a way
*  that's dependent on a number of factors that allow it to optimize that adaptation.
*  Well, Sean, I say this all the time, that I always run out of time,
*  but in this case, I have so much more stuff to talk with you about,
*  and I don't know how I let it slip away.
*  So I apologize, and hopefully I'm going to badger you and see if I can get you back on
*  the show again in the future.
*  For now, I will let you go.
*  People can find you at roshancools.com or on Twitter at CoolsControl,
*  which is a great Twitter handle, by the way.
*  Anyway, get along now, but thank you very much for being on the show,
*  and hopefully I'll see you in Berlin in a few months.
*  Thank you, Paul, for the opportunity.
