# BI 084 György Buzsáki and David Poeppel
**Brain Inspired:** [September 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGff5wOcGl4)
*  Every science in the history, physics, chemistry, genetics, computer science, they came up with
*  their own defined vocabulary.
*  Neuroscience hasn't.
*  Neuroscience is just take it for granted that we are already given a vocabulary and we have
*  a roadmap.
*  All we have to do is take those words and identify their mechanisms.
*  I'm a naive realist.
*  I believe the world is as it is and we can figure it out.
*  I would like to put our best foot forward.
*  I think the slightly too casual dismissal of the contribution of the psychological sciences
*  comes at a cost that I don't want to incur.
*  David, let me push you in a corner now.
*  Okay, please.
*  Here is a quote from you.
*  The things to be explained are human cognitive faculties.
*  So here are my questions.
*  It's important, I think, that people realize that we can be friends, colleagues, and actually
*  appreciate the work and just try to understand these very difficult problems and debate.
*  There's just nothing wrong with that.
*  That hopefully makes better science, makes our arguments deeper.
*  We're working on extremely difficult problems.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  What's more important for understanding brain and mental functions, psychology or neuroscience?
*  That's the super short version of the question for today's episode, which is about the balance
*  between the functional level terms and descriptions of psychology and the mechanism level terms
*  and descriptions of neuroscience and how we should proceed to explain and understand
*  not only the relation between brains and minds, but how to conceptualize what it is we're
*  even trying to explain and understand.
*  Hey, everyone.
*  I'm Paul.
*  Welcome to the show.
*  I'm really grateful to bring you today, Yuri Buzaki and David Popol to discuss this.
*  So Yuri and David are both neuroscientists at NYU.
*  It's been on the podcast before back on episode 46.
*  And the reason they're both on is because of a recent exchange of commentaries they
*  had in the journal eNeuro about these topics.
*  Yuri has recently written the book The Brain From Inside Out, which summarizes years and
*  years of his thoughts and much neuroscience work from his own lab and from other labs.
*  It is a fantastic book, and we refer to it a lot throughout the conversation.
*  So you'll learn more about it.
*  But the exchange he and David had recently stems from Yuri deciding to try to publish
*  something that he wrote 20 years ago, which got rejected 20 years ago.
*  But that 20-year-old manuscript contains the seeds and some core ideas that later developed
*  into his book, The Brain From Inside Out.
*  So Yuri resubmitted that original commentary manuscript, and you'll hear him tell the
*  story.
*  But the end product is a series of commentaries between the editor, Christophe Bernard, and
*  Yuri and David.
*  So the short version is that Yuri believes we've suffered too long at the hands of psychologists
*  who tend to give a name to something that they deem a mental function, like attention,
*  and then leave it up to neuroscientists to then find attention in the brain.
*  He thinks, rather, that we should use what we observe about brains to better develop
*  the concepts and terms in psychology.
*  David, who, by the way, recently released the latest edition of the definitive Cognitive
*  Neurosciences textbook, David believes it's a mistake to give brain mechanisms primacy
*  over mental functions when it comes to understanding the emergent properties of brain function
*  and our minds, that rather they should be given equal footing, and that neuroscientists,
*  whether they admit it or not, are always operating under some assumptions about the mental functions
*  their brain experiments refer to.
*  All right, so those are just the starting points.
*  We cover a lot of terrain from there.
*  And for fun, I asked two previous guests on the show, Paul Chisek and John Krakauer, to
*  each record a question for Yuri and David.
*  So I play those questions and Yuri and David respond.
*  And there's even a guest appearance by a little family of black bears for a little intermission.
*  All right, so I link to all of the many things I just discussed, including the commentaries
*  and Yuri's book and David's book in the show notes at braininspired.co.
*  slash podcast slash 84.
*  Man.

*  the episodes and occasional separate bonus episodes, you can do that for next to nothing
*  through Patreon.

*  All right, again, I just feel very grateful to bring you these wonderful minds, and I
*  feel lucky for being able to host them.
*  And I hope you feel lucky for getting to listen to them.
*  Enjoy.
*  Yuri, your recent book, The Brain from Inside Out, which I love, and I also loved Rhythms
*  of the Brain.
*  They're both written really, really well.
*  And it's just something for authors to aspire to.
*  One of the wonderful features in both those books are the summaries that you give at the
*  end.
*  The little chapter summaries, they're so good.
*  When I was in graduate school, after I read Rhythms of the Brain, I took the book, which
*  the library had, to the copier, which also had a scanner.
*  And at the time, this seemed pretty fancy to me.
*  And I scanned in all of the summaries.
*  And I still have it on my computer.
*  So it's made it through a few different computers now.
*  And just recently, I just pulled it out, actually, to make sure I still had it.
*  So nice job on both books.
*  But The Brain from Inside Out is also filled with a bunch of quotes.
*  So I'm going to start with what I think is a relevant quote for today and see if you
*  guys can guess who it's from.
*  Quote, I am convinced that an important stage of human thought will have been reached when
*  the physiological and the psychological, the objective and the subjective, are actually
*  united, when the tormenting conflicts or contradictions between my consciousness and my body will have
*  been factually resolved or discarded.
*  Can you guys guess who that is?
*  No, but I would have said Descartes.
*  Oh, Descartes, pretty good guess.
*  Yuri, any guess?
*  Somebody like Descartes could say that.
*  Well, Pavlov would be, I think he would take that as a compliment.
*  He should.
*  That he was guessed as Descartes.
*  There is nothing new under the sun.
*  There is nothing new under the sun.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah, really.
*  And Descartes, it could very well have been Descartes.
*  So people can be very opinionated about this topic, so I'm confident today that we will
*  resolve it, I'm sure.
*  Okay, here's another quote before we really get the ball rolling.
*  Quote, I analyzed how an undefined and an agreed upon terminology, which we inherited
*  from our pre-neuroscience ancestors and never questioned, has become a roadblock to progress.
*  Yuri, any guesses?
*  Could be Case-Vander-Wolf.
*  Descartes, perhaps?
*  I would have said, I would have guessed.
*  Yuri, that's Yuri.
*  There you go, yeah.
*  That's Yuri.
*  That's a tweet that Yuri wrote, for sure.
*  That's a tweet, yeah.
*  But I can come up with several people, of course, who, again, thoughts mature very slowly
*  and they get embedded into the right environment.
*  And that process is very slow.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, okay, guys.
*  I'm going to ask you both to summarize two minutes, whatever it really takes, not more
*  than 45 minutes.
*  Just briefly summarize your positions, your perspectives on these issues, and then we'll
*  move on from there.
*  And Yuri, let's just start with you, because the way that the articles worked is you posted
*  your 20-year-old article, which David then got to respond to.
*  And then after you guys summarize, then we'll come back and I'll let Yuri also respond
*  to David's response.
*  So Yuri, take it away.
*  Well, historically, research on the brain has been working its way in from the outside
*  world, hoping that such systematic exploration will take us someday to the middle and on
*  through the middle to the output.
*  Ever since the time of Aristotle, philosophers and scientists assumed that the brain, or
*  more precisely, back then, the mind, is initially a blank slate filled up gradually with experience
*  in an outside-in manner.
*  An alternative, a brain-centric view, the one I'm proposing is that self-organized
*  brain networks induce a vast repertoire of preformed neural patterns.
*  While interacting with the world, some of these initially nonsensical patterns require
*  behavioral significance, or you can call them meaning.
*  Thus experience is a process of matching pre-existing neural dynamics to events of the world.
*  The perpetually active internal dynamic is the source of cognition, a neural operation
*  disengaged from immediate senses.
*  Accordingly, in my book that you kindly mentioned, The Brain from Inside Out, I discuss three
*  major topics.
*  First, how we got to our presently dominant framework in neuroscience.
*  The second part argues in favor of the idea that all sources of knowledge, including our
*  perceptions, memories, and plans, derives from actions.
*  In the third part, I illustrate the advantages of self-organized, pre-configured brain and
*  present it as an alternative to the blank slate framework.
*  Now, thinking about part of the book began 20 years ago when I wrote that review, a manifesto,
*  if you want, about the origin of our scientific terminology, which is the main topic of the
*  book's introduction.
*  In this old review, I summarize how neuroscientists began to study the brain, buying into a system
*  created by philosophers and psychologists for understanding the soul and the mind without
*  ever asking how those terms, whose brain function neuroscientists are trying to understand,
*  such as consciousness, attention, and so on, were brought into our thinking in the first
*  place.
*  I argued that this outside-in framework may not be the best strategy to understand the
*  brain.
*  Although back then I didn't have enough ammunition to offer an alternative, the arguments laid
*  down in that unpublished manuscript have become more popular over the years.
*  So to test the waters, I resubmitted the paper and got four good reviews.
*  Now published this text with its 20-year-old references and thinking is a good target for
*  contemporary cognitive scientists like David Poppel, who can rip it apart and offer better
*  substitutes.
*  All right.
*  That's a good introduction.
*  David, do you want to just take it from there?
*  Sure.
*  So there's a few things for context I want to start with.
*  First of all, like you said, Paul, and for me as well, Yuri's book, Rhythms of the Brain,
*  is absolutely foundational and super important and required reading in my lab.
*  It's an absolutely kind of masterpiece.
*  And I have to say very kindly, I once saw Yuri at a lecture I gave, I think it was a
*  Rutgers and he signed the book.
*  I had the book with me and he signed it saying, all intelligent people think about timing,
*  which I thought was very good.
*  Thanks for that, Yuri.
*  And then of course, I veraciously read his recent book.
*  Now there's a kind of larger point I want to start with before we debate all kinds of
*  nitty-gritty argumentation.
*  That is, I want to make clear to listeners and particular students and post-docs or trainees
*  how useful it is to be able to have debates even among friends and colleagues.
*  So a few years ago, I was teaching a class at Cold Spring Harbor.
*  And in that context, I got into a really intensive debate with one of my very close friends and
*  we really had it out for an hour or so.
*  And the students came back and felt uncomfortable about this level of back and forth, which
*  I found really disturbing because it has nothing to do with our regard for each other, with
*  our respect for each other's work and so on.
*  We were disagreeing on some points and we really went after each other.
*  And the trainees didn't like that.
*  And I found that not good actually.
*  And it really, I found it bewildering and disturbing.
*  And one of the things I really appreciate about being able to sort of bounce back and
*  forth ideas with Yuri and having a discussion today is that it's important, I think, that
*  people realize that we can be friends, colleagues and actually appreciate the work and just
*  try to understand these very difficult problems and debate.
*  There's just nothing wrong with that.
*  That hopefully makes better science, makes our arguments deeper.
*  And we're working on extremely difficult problems.
*  And so don't begrudge us that we can like each other and still debate points because
*  we're trying to move the thing forward.
*  I found that a really odd reaction a few years ago and it really kind of moved me.
*  I'm very happy that we can do something about the topics.
*  So I had exactly the same memory and experience as your students many years ago when my mentor
*  Andrew Graszczan invited Walter Freeman, our Walter Freeman, to give a talk in Hungary.
*  And then during his talk, Graszczan attacked him.
*  And it was strange to me why he invites a person from far away lands to attack him.
*  And at lunch, Walter Freeman said, Oh, I never had such a good time for a long time.
*  But it made you uncomfortable, Yuri, at the time?
*  Yeah, well, it was just like like David's students.
*  But I think David's students also realize in time that, you know, discussion is the
*  way how to move forward.
*  Exactly.
*  If you don't play out your cards, how do you know what's in the cards?
*  Well, I was going to ask David before you told that story, whether he thought that it
*  was a generational thing or whether it was a developmental aspect that happens every
*  generation.
*  I really don't know.
*  Is it snowflakes or is it a normal developmental trajectory?
*  I must say, I don't know.
*  So the paper that I wrote just in reaction to Yuri's paper that, you know, Christoph
*  Bernard kindly invited us to comment on is a graduate student.
*  He's a young Federico Adolfi.
*  He's a young scientist who works on computational topics and psychophysics.
*  He just has a big appetite for these topics and knowledge and likes to read.
*  So it can't be purely generational.
*  I do remember in graduate school, growing up in a context where debate was vigorous,
*  maybe sometimes too vigorous and valued.
*  And I think that's not always the case so much.
*  I think it's a risk that we take to be too...
*  I mean, these are not things that are ad hominem.
*  We can say, I just think you're wrong about this argument.
*  We try to move the needle and I think people should accept that as part of a positive part
*  of the scientific process, actually.
*  Is that why you...
*  So in your article, and I'm sorry, this is already a digression, which is totally fine
*  because that's what we should do.
*  But is that why you are so complimentary throughout the article of Yuri's work just to
*  ward off the potential blowback?
*  I think it's important to be clear because this is not about...
*  So, for instance, take the last part of...
*  I think it's the last part of Yuri's book where there's tons of places where, of course,
*  I agree.
*  Those are very fundamental points, in particular, the last part.
*  That's not good for the show, David.
*  That's not good for the show.
*  No, don't worry.
*  I'll disagree soon.
*  So there's a part of the book, for instance, the notion of pre-formed, self-organized dynamics
*  that form the basis.
*  I'm absolutely on board with that.
*  I think that's actually where I think it would be fun to work together on how to move that
*  forwards.
*  I completely agree.
*  But the point is one can agree on certain things, on data, on how to do experiments,
*  and disagree about the foundations of how we move this forward.
*  And that is where I disagree.
*  And that's the things I tried to highlight in our reaction to Yuri's piece.
*  Yeah.
*  You want to summarize what the...
*  So I'll summarize quickly.
*  So maybe the easiest way to summarize it is that we stand in defense of the outside in view
*  rather than the clear inside out view that Yuri outlines because we think that it happens anyway.
*  So that the inside out, the kind of stringently, strikingly inside out view that Yuri argues for
*  in the book is not really what happens.
*  You have implicit hypotheses.
*  You're an implicit philosopher.
*  You make assumptions that sort of underpin what you're trying to explain.
*  Then you do the very detailed, implementational work.
*  And then you go back and sort of revise and try to make it very explicit.
*  So we have a sort of slightly cheeky phrase called the implementation sandwich.
*  You can't just start with the wetware or the brain.
*  You actually make some assumptions about what you're trying to explain.
*  Then you do the implementation level work and then you refine the kind of psychology
*  or cognitive science.
*  But you sandwich the implementation work.
*  You don't just go from a characterization of the hardware to a putative function.
*  That's where I think we probably disagree.
*  Okay.
*  So Yuri, I want to give you a chance to respond here to David's perspective.
*  First of all, is that an accurate portrayal of your view?
*  Or would you say that maybe he mischaracterized some of your goals?
*  Is there a straw man that David is addressing that isn't your objective?
*  Well, first of all, I'd like to thank David and Federico for taking their time.
*  Reading by review and parts of my book and writing a beautiful piece.
*  Expressing differences of opinion.
*  I think this is what we expected.
*  I'm talking about neuroscience and the brain.
*  I think David is representing the psychology and the mind.
*  He claims that the object of neuroscience is the hardware, wetware itself.
*  This is what he has written.
*  But in reality, no self-respecting neuroscientist would agree with such correspondence.
*  The focus of neuroscience is how behavior and cognition are generated by the brain,
*  including by its interaction with its niche, which is the body it supports
*  and other brains it communicates with.
*  I agree with David that it may be premature to abandon the traditional outside strategy
*  in some areas of cognitive neuroscience because currently there may be no substitute.
*  But my argument is that the time is right for neuroscience
*  because the outside in framework has reached an asymptote in many areas.
*  And that process began perhaps 20 years ago.
*  I claim that the inevitable consequence of the outside in framework
*  is viewing the brain as a blank slate.
*  Nobody believes in it.
*  But in practice, this idea just does not go away.
*  AI is talking about brain inspired algorithms.
*  But as a result of taking the current state of neuroscience,
*  virtually all AI is based on the tabula rasa philosophy.
*  Now, David and Federico are trying to push me in a corner of a boxing ring
*  so they can have advantage for it to make their statements.
*  In the tradition of classic cognitive science, they first come up with labels
*  which in their view characterize my work, such as epistemological primacy of the hardware.
*  I like that.
*  The radical implementationist.
*  I like that too.
*  But when I, these terms I explained in detail in the paper, David, I feel that these attacks
*  actually are directed towards Henry Markram's original human brain project
*  which recommends to build up a brain from bottom up.
*  But I do not belong to that camp at all.
*  And the inside out view is very different from the bottom up reductionist formulation.
*  In fact, a good part of my book is trying to explain why such program have limitations
*  using similar arguments to David and Federico.
*  Again, the inside out framework has little to do with the bottom up implementationism.
*  It suggests that the debate between the cognitive terms
*  which are made up by our predecessors and brain mechanisms,
*  brain mechanisms should be the arbitrators, not the other way around.
*  That's all I wanted to say in response for now.
*  All right, good.
*  Can I just since we're, just on this particular issue because it's important,
*  I think that yeah, the question is how brain mechanisms, brain mechanisms are the arbitrators
*  of what, right?
*  So how will, so in the end, our real disagreement is about the utility of the concepts from the
*  psychological and cognitive sciences and how neural data on its own could adjudicate between
*  alternatives that are posed that way.
*  So I'm more optimistic on the side that cognitive science and computation and some amalgam
*  actually have as an equal status in terms of evidence as neuroscience.
*  I think that's where we may disagree actually.
*  That's why we call it epistemological primacy or whatever the phrase was we used to say.
*  Actually, in the end, the most serious arbitration comes from the neurobiological data,
*  not from the cognitive science or psychological data.
*  Yeah, so you ask, you know, what do the brain mechanisms will refer to?
*  Well, what they refer to is already to our preconceived ideas, but they help us to
*  systematize, to abandon some assumptions and reinforce others.
*  I never ever thought seriously, but I'm, I realized that perhaps it's easy to
*  misunderstand what I said.
*  I don't suggest that we go into the brain.
*  We do a lot of things there and voila, the cognitive terms will come out.
*  No, we go into anything, into anything, any thought has a background.
*  It has a context.
*  So we always go with something in it.
*  And I say it very clearly in the last two chapters that the brain always guesses.
*  There is nothing new in the world for the brain.
*  Everything is everything is familiar and then the familiar becomes with time
*  different if the organism has problems with understanding that.
*  So I understand that part of my brain centered obsession can be viewed as a
*  radical implementation.
*  Naive view how to, yes, how to you go here and from elements you build up the brain,
*  but no, I doubt that's possible.
*  And I think this is a platform that we more agree than disagree.
*  There are other areas we will discuss later where there is a disagreement,
*  but I think this is a, this is perhaps my mistake to not clarify it enough.
*  And I think the main problem is that indeed that target article probably had the flavor
*  of this, not necessarily the book, but the article was written 20 years ago.
*  It's not a good excuse, but.
*  David, you were going to respond.
*  Do you want to briefly respond?
*  Yeah.
*  So I think there's a, you raise an important point, which is I think where we, they,
*  I want to make a distinction between implementation driven versus sort of
*  radical reductionism.
*  Those seem to me a little different.
*  So what I want to impute to Yuri is that he is an implementationalist
*  in the sense of anti-MAR or something like that.
*  Although it's not quite, that's not correct about MAR.
*  We'll get to that later.
*  But the, and that is the, there is really a higher status of the evidence
*  of the implementation level.
*  That doesn't have to be reductionist in the sense of going to, you know,
*  synaptic mechanisms or quantum mechanics.
*  Some level of description that is the level of the implementation of the
*  putative mechanism is higher ranked in terms of what it is as evidence
*  than some other evidence.
*  And I don't think, I guess evidence is just evidence, right?
*  And there's no sort of, this is the best evidence, the second best, the third best.
*  I just don't see that.
*  So I absolutely agree with Yuri that some of the more trenchant critique is
*  directed at the research program that kind of Henry Markram pushed,
*  which I also see as not even coherent, actually.
*  It's not even clear how that could go anywhere at all.
*  So I have no sympathy for that and I wouldn't take the time to write a paper about it.
*  It's just, it's incoherent.
*  Okay. All right.
*  So this is a great beginning here and I'm just going to, right off the bat,
*  we're going to get into questions from my little surprise guests here.
*  And you guys didn't know who these were and they didn't know,
*  they knew who each other were, but they didn't know what each other's question was.
*  Okay. So the first question is from John Krakauer and this question will be directed
*  more toward Yuri, but we can, you know, you can both discuss the second.
*  And then before you actually react to that, I'm going to go and play the second question.
*  And that is from Paul Chisak and that will be directed more toward David.
*  And then, and then I'll play the two questions and then we can move on.
*  So here, if you guys are ready, here's John Krakauer.
*  Hi, Yuri. This is John.
*  Sorry that I can't be asking this question in person.
*  I very much look back fondly on our debate at Columbia several years ago.
*  So here's my question.
*  On page 225 of your wonderful new book, you say this about tools.
*  They had to be imagined before their maker could start working.
*  Artifacts are externalized versions of a thought, a reflection of contemplation.
*  Artifacts are semantic entities.
*  So given that you want to get rid of philosophical and psychological language,
*  I challenge you to restate that sentence with only neural implementational language.
*  So no psychological terms allowed, remove the words imagination, reflection,
*  thought, contemplation, and semantics, and say it all in terms of neurons and circuits.
*  I would contend you won't be able to do it.
*  And please note, you use those psychological terms to hypothesize yourself about externalization.
*  So they're doing work for you conceptually.
*  You may answer that we need to find a new language based on
*  implementational level details, but that's never going to happen in my view.
*  You're always going to have compressed psychological concepts to express
*  ideas about cognition and neural data will simply be confirmatory.
*  So my question is, do you really think that you're going to be able to forego
*  the very language that you yourself use throughout your book to conceptualize with?
*  Cheers.
*  Okay. So that's John's. Can you hold that in mind and we'll play Paul's
*  just because they're of a similar nature, but directed in different directions.
*  Okay. So here is Paul.
*  So my question is for Dr. Popol.
*  In principle, I agree that neuroscience needs behavior and that what we should seek is alignment
*  between theories about low-level neural mechanisms and high-level psychological concepts.
*  However, the need for having high-level concepts does not imply that the particular
*  high-level concepts we currently have are necessarily the right ones.
*  And here I agree with Dr. Buzaki that many of the current concepts of mainstream cognitive
*  neuroscience are inherited from folk psychology and from largely outdated
*  pre-scientific ideas about the human mind. In fact, Russ Poldrack has pointed out that
*  about 80% of psychological terms in use today were already around in the year 1800,
*  which is long before psychology was actually a science.
*  So despite all we've learned about neural mechanisms and all that time,
*  we still use many of the same old high-level conceptual categories to describe behavior.
*  We've subdivided them into smaller categories, but the general taxonomy has resisted change.
*  So my question is this. Do you believe that the high-level concepts have resisted change
*  because they are so good, or is it because they are the words we use to talk to each other about
*  behavior and thus they have a kind of stranglehold on our scientific conversation? If the latter,
*  then what can we do to break that stranglehold? Should we continue to subdivide and modify the
*  same concepts or, as I would argue, and I think Dr. Buzaki would argue, should we instead seek a
*  different set of high-level concepts that are better informed by all that we've learned about
*  neural mechanisms and real animal behavior? Okay, so Yura, you want to respond to David's
*  challenge? John's challenge. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sorry. I've spoken to too many crack...
*  There's a David crack hour too, right? I know. I've spoken to too many of them recently.
*  So yeah, yeah, to John's challenge. Yes, John, thank you very much for the question.
*  My response is very similar to what I just gave to David that I'd like to apologize if you thought
*  that somehow I naively think that we should have opened up the skull, you know, 2000 years ago and
*  instead of going to the forum and the Agora in Athens and discuss these things and just look
*  something, some kind of mechanism in the brain and build from there, from the details of
*  physiological observations, then I agree with you that would be a naive thing. I fully agree with you
*  in general as well as with the beautiful paper that you have written with David and several others
*  that behavior is a fundamental thing. In fact, you may remember and David probably remembers
*  that in the good old days when you did any kind of psychological experiment with evoke responses,
*  for example, it was mandatory to record the heart rate, respiration, the galvanic skin reflexes,
*  and so on, because there are so many hidden variables that my full the investigator that
*  the bold signal change is not a cognitive correlate, but just a change in respiration.
*  So I'm fully with you. And I agree that whenever we go into doing an experiment,
*  we already have our preconceived ideas. And these preconceived ideas are coming from other brains.
*  That's what this is why I said and David picked up this sentence that it's impossible to find
*  nothing in the brain. Yes, it's impossible to find nothing because we have already tons and tons of
*  alternatives, which we can exclude. This is what I call the null hypothesis that we go in, we do
*  something, and then we can reduce the realm of possibilities, we can abandon one at a time.
*  And this is what's called scientific progress. So I don't want to be put into the in the bottom up
*  build build it up from elements camp, because I know it is impossible to break apart a complex
*  system and put it together from its ingredients without understanding the higher rules that
*  keep together a complex system. And we can just jump from there,
*  David, you want to answer Paul's question? Yes. Thank you, Paul, for that extremely
*  interesting point. And of course, very much related to the points that Yuri makes in his
*  original paper, and of course, in the recent book Bring From Inside Out, and also actually a point
*  that the editor of the special issue Christophe Bernard makes about naming things and giving them
*  kind of medieval nominalism, giving it, you know, reifying concepts by giving them a name.
*  I think that I am much more optimistic than you and your question and Yuri in his book
*  about the progress that the psychological and cognitive sciences can make and have made.
*  And I think it's very important to make a distinction between the casual everyday use
*  of terminology that has turned out to be quite useful for talking to each other and the scientific
*  decomposition. The standard, there's a philosophical tradition, Wilfrid Sellers,
*  the philosopher makes this very clearly called the manifest image and the scientific image in
*  that particular line of philosophy of science, which is we use certain terminology just in our,
*  let's say, daily locution because it works. So Yuri actually gives the example of the concept greed
*  because it's something we understand, it's very easy, and we explain behavior quite effectively
*  to each other. It doesn't follow from that, that a very systematic decomposition cannot
*  yield new taxonomies or new structures of these concepts. So I think we just, you know,
*  like neuroscience, cognitive science or psychology are not that old and we need to give the field a
*  little bit of credit. I mean, I'm a pretty nasty critic generally of my own field, or at least I'm
*  on record as being pretty nasty to my own field. But I also want to defend that the cognitive
*  sciences in particular, as they're becoming more and more computationally explicit,
*  have made serious progress in decomposing things. We don't just use a concept like
*  imagination or we use a concept like, well, maybe part of imagination draws on memory mechanisms,
*  which themselves are complicated and internal forward models and predictive coding and ensembles
*  in it. So I think we have to be, you have to give a little bit more credit to the conceptual analysis
*  that the cognitive sciences and philosophy are offering right now and be optimistic.
*  Because there's really, we're not just working with terminology, like my personal favorites from
*  the time of Gaal, things like relationship to your parents was a conceptual primitive.
*  You're talking about phrenology time.
*  Yeah. So you think now retrospectively, we make fun of that. But in the context of Gaal's,
*  what was going on in the history of how minds were explained, that's a totally reasonable concept,
*  right? The notion that you would have a special attachment to your caregivers. That's not crazy.
*  But now we have, of course, much more richly structured and fine grained and pulled apart
*  conceptual analysis. And I think, so I'm actually optimistic. The question that you raise at the end
*  of your question is whether an approach that's different and maybe more endorsed by Uri would
*  yield a different taxonomy. That's a totally reasonable question and an empirical question,
*  right? So as we decompose these things more, find successful linking hypothesis to neurobiological
*  mechanisms, we might end up with a slightly different parts list of the mind, which would be,
*  I think everyone is actually open to. That doesn't mean I shouldn't use words like greed anymore
*  or imagination or will. Those are words that we use. They actually do a lot of work for us.
*  I suggest the work of the philosopher Jerry Fodor explains very well how simple concepts like that,
*  they work for daily life, but they don't work for scientific analysis. And as long as we keep
*  that separate, I think we're on safe ground. So it does seem like a lot of this is,
*  first of all, thanks for answering these surprise questions.
*  Thank you for having surprise questions. It's a very good idea. Very, very nice idea.
*  And from good people.
*  Yes.
*  People I really respect.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  They're okay. Yeah.
*  They're okay.
*  So it just seems like so much of this is wrapped up in the language that we use.
*  Uri, one of the things that you state that you would, I believe you explicitly stated,
*  is that you would like to develop from neuroscience, sort of a new language to
*  describe the principles and patterns found in circuits and activity dynamics of neurons.
*  First of all, is that correct? And if so, how's the new dictionary coming along?
*  It's a nice question. And this is what everybody asks, how we make progress.
*  Well, David mentioned and, you know, we ridiculed Gold. And it's easy because
*  we are a little bit smarter, collectively speaking, as a group. But he was probably
*  smarter than any of us back then. Now, I can say the same thing about-
*  I absolutely agree. I'm officially on record as agreeing.
*  Indeed, you know, I think recently we discussed it with Jim McGraw, is that, you know,
*  how easy it is to ridicule somebody. And he was, he's very strongly in defense of
*  Franz Gold. Now, the same can be said about the giant of psychology, you know, William James.
*  And the reason why I pick on him is not because I don't like him, but because he's the best.
*  And indeed, his is what I call the James List is something that looked like the top of the top
*  back then in 1890. But today, many of those things look a little funny. And so how do you know,
*  or how do we know that those things that we take seriously today, let me pick on this term,
*  decision making, a very popular one. You know, we'll not be ridiculed 10 years from now or 50
*  years from now. So how do I imagine this progress? Let me just give you two examples. The first one
*  is that memory, planning, and imagination, these are so different concepts. There are different
*  chapters dedicated to understand and explain it to students in textbooks. There are different
*  people who are doing this research separately. People who are doing imagination, they don't talk
*  or don't necessarily have much to do with memory or planning. But over the past decade or so,
*  starting perhaps with cognitive scientists or starting with us, neurophysiologists, we realized
*  that, you know, one thing can be called prediction, the other one can be called postdiction.
*  And one belongs to the past, the other one belongs to the future, related to the current presence.
*  But now when we look at it, for example, through hippocampal theta oscillations,
*  or hippocampal sharp wave ripples, then the past, the present, and the future just confluences into
*  one entity, then all of a sudden you may wonder whether these separations are justifiable. And
*  then Schachter and then many others who started looking at the imaging of the brain, they were
*  all of a sudden surprised that the same structures, and I could add perhaps the same exact mechanisms
*  that are mobilized when you are traveling back to the past, are the same as when you are thinking
*  about the future or making plans. So based on neural mechanism, I can imagine, maybe premature,
*  but these three words, in fact, will be pulled together just like in relativism of physics,
*  that they are not separate, they are the same. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.
*  Now there is another interesting concept that I attacked several years ago, and then there is a
*  actually I think Paul Cisak was also one of them. It's about attention. And, you know,
*  attention is such a vague, horrible, terrible concept, but it is so useful. And if you look at
*  it slightly differently from the brain mechanism's point of view, and you say, aha, it's nothing else
*  but gain. And then David Anderson and Richard Anderson and several other people have produced
*  beautiful results that indeed is a game mechanism that we can now explain with a little bit of
*  acetylcholine and inhibition. Or another concept, or another territory is running speed. What does
*  running speed have to do with attention? I claim that they are the same thing. The attention is
*  internalized running speed. Running speed is a game mechanism, and the animal goes faster than
*  it produces a game through perhaps acetylcholine and through the same inter neurons that the brain
*  internalizes this initially environment dependent or body dependent function and releases the same
*  acetylcholine to use or produce the same thing, such as a game modulation. And that's what the
*  psychologists call attention. So this is another example. I think when we can make inroads taking
*  a lumping together ideas, and perhaps you can come up with a different formulation. This is
*  what happened in physics. Atom is not dividable, but we still call it atom, but with the new
*  understanding because now atom is better defined. But you mentioned needing new words. Do we need
*  new words? I mean, does it a reckoning of psychological terms that we need or a
*  discarding of them? You know, either way it worked in the history, you know, genetics, you know, we
*  are still talking about the same genes that the words haven't been different, but the meaning,
*  the definition have changed. Every science, every science in the history, physics, chemistry,
*  genetics, computer science, they came up with their own defined vocabulary.
*  Neuroscience hasn't. Neuroscience is just take it for granted that we are already given a
*  vocabulary and we have a roadmap. All we have to do is take those words and identify their
*  mechanisms. When I go to give a talk somewhere and I ask and I show James List, then everybody
*  in the audience without an exception can identify with one of himself or herself with one of those
*  terms that yeah, I'm going to dedicate my entire life to figure out attention or I'm going to work
*  on memory. I'm going to work on emotion and so on. As if those entities are really the ones that
*  you will identify when you are starting poking the brain. But let me ask you, can you or can
*  I ask you? So, but I mean that amplifies my concern about being, you know, carefully
*  decomposing concepts into their constituent parts, just like you raise the issue of atom, right? We
*  take it as a primitive, but really as their smaller primitives inside there. But in the case of
*  neuroscience, where we do, of course, neuroscience does have the vocabulary for the neurobiological
*  parts list. Do you think we have that correctly identified? So, I mean, you criticize
*  often rightly that the cognitive sciences and psychology are kind of lame or using old
*  vocabulary, but that makes a sort of implicit presupposition that neuroscience has its parts
*  list correctly identified and I'm not so sure that that's true. Things like action potential.
*  Yeah, take that. I mean, so we make assumption that let's say, you know, the neuron doctrine,
*  very successful idea, is that really the representational or computational primitive in
*  a brain, maybe it's going to turn out in 10 years that it's some weird ensemble that we don't yet
*  know. Maybe it's seven neurons wired up a certain way. So, we have a vocabulary for neurobiology,
*  but should we assume that it is actually more successful? I'm not so sure that I'm willing to
*  buy that. You're right that, you know, this argument can go from every level down to a deeper and deeper
*  level. But it's always the case that in order to understand one level, you have to understand
*  something about the interaction of an upper and a lower level. I'm not saying, and you know, you
*  try to put me in a corner and say that I'm trying to say, I'm not saying that you need quantum physics
*  to explain the knee jerk reflex. The knee jerk reflex can be explained the way how I explain it
*  to my mother-in-law. But we have to ground our observations with other observations which seem
*  to be independent, because otherwise we would be double dipping. So, when you say we decompose,
*  and you know, you know, science made enormous progress and you cite your own area, which I
*  I really respect and I will come back to that, you know, by decomposing the, you know, you just
*  cannot go and say, oh, I'm going to the brain to figure out language. No, you have to decompose
*  those things. It's just like attention. These are complicated concepts with internal structure.
*  But then it reminds me a little bit of the program of Hubel and Wiesel, because Hubel and Wiesel said,
*  you know, vision is a complicated thing. Let's break it down to a simple ingredients. Let's
*  just study the impact of horizontal and vertical lines or neurons, and then edges, and then contours,
*  and maybe little color. And someday from these elementary things that we identified, we'll put
*  together the composition. And of course, it didn't work. And it, you know, I always wondered, you
*  know, how many more monkeys, cats, and how many neuroscientists are needed, and how many more
*  experiments to move forward. And the answer is that if the entire world in the eye of
*  60,000 neuroscientists in the world will do nothing just the same kind of experiment in the same
*  outside in framework, then we wouldn't get much smarter. So I wonder if that decomposition
*  that is done without grounding is more than just an exercise. And my answer is,
*  yes, it's just an exercise. And your answer is that what I recommend is going to the
*  deeper is also an exercise. And this is what science is, you know, it's an exercise. And we'll go to
*  the sandwich problem a little bit later. But this is exactly what we do. We are trying to ground
*  a unknown or less familiar things with a more familiar thing.
*  But I mean, look, so I respectfully disagree that the decomposition is just ad hoc. I think the
*  point of it is that you take some idea, you know, whatever it is, attention, language, pick your
*  favorite psychological domain, we pick it apart, you know, like peel the onion, because the assumption
*  is that one of those sub things is a more plausible way to link to the neurobiological thing. Right,
*  if you say, what's the brain basis of language? I have no idea. That's made up out of dozens and
*  dozens of subroutines. But if I can make it into something that could be realistically probed at
*  the level of a cell, a circuit, an ensemble, a column, God knows what, don't you think that
*  that would actually then be at the granularity of linking hypotheses between the neurobiological
*  infrastructure and some part of the concept that we're trying to get? Right. So it's not an ad
*  hoc decomposition. It's a decomposition with a motivation to find to identify a linking hypothesis
*  to the neurobiology. I mean, I think that's the premise of the research program.
*  Well, I think what the inside out framework suggests is that it's on a safer ground
*  where we compare these decomposed ideas and comfort them against brain mechanisms than without brain
*  mechanisms. And I can ask the question from you that your composition or decomposition
*  help you to ground your things by relating them to brain rhythms.
*  No, that's exactly it. But let me remind you that we went out and figured out and tried to work on
*  the system of brain rhythms and their cross-frequency coupling without language in mind.
*  So, you know, we have observed that these are regularities that are there probably to serve
*  something important. And we can talk about later if you want to know why they are important and
*  general principles. And it happened to be a fertile ground for language.
*  Right. This is a perfect example. So this is the-
*  David, can you just actually just summarize like that linkage before
*  the phoneme, like syllabic?
*  So there's an aspect of language comprehension is a complicated problem.
*  It's complicated from a point of view because you have a more or less continuous signal. And so as
*  we're having a conversation, there's a physical waveform. It comes to you. And in the end, the
*  remarkable thing of communication is that I send you a physical signal to your ear and it ends up
*  as an idea in your mind, which is cool. And the fact that we can have a conversation is actually
*  unbelievably impressive from a brain's eye view, from a mind's eye view. One of the problems you
*  have to do is you have to actually- it has been known for a long time, certainly, for probably
*  100 years it's been discussed, certainly since the late 40s. How do you actually chunk the
*  information that's coming continuously into usable bits of information that you can then work with?
*  This has been a pain in the ass of a problem for a long, long time. And some years ago,
*  there were now here functionally driven questions, right? Questions about how do you- about this,
*  how would you do this? And a few people, a community of us thought, well, here's a really
*  cool way to do it. So there's this interesting thing of excitability cycles or oscillations in
*  the brain. What would be if you actually found a link between what they're doing and that particular
*  problem, because it gives you a potential mechanism for chunking things at different
*  timescales? And that's a hypothesis that you can chunk things at different levels of sizes,
*  let's say at the syllabic level or smaller levels. And then you can do experiments. Is it real?
*  Some people think it's totally epiphenomenal. I think they're wrong. I think it's real and
*  important. You can begin to really try to parse apart the problem. So there's a case where there's
*  a neurobiological phenomenon, which turns out to be immensely useful for querying a functional aspect
*  of language comprehension. But note that it's because we knew the particular problem that had
*  to be solved, namely the problem of segmenting a continuous stream into smaller chunks of different
*  temporal sizes. And that's a case. So the reason I like that line of research is because it's to me
*  a really interesting linking hypothesis between a part of language comprehension
*  and a part of neurobiology, both of which are very well motivated. And then you can try to figure out
*  how does it work? How do you manipulate it? How do you actually cash it out? So that's sort of the...
*  And I think that's an area about the area and I probably very much agree about that particular
*  issue. That's not... So David, what other arguments you think you could use to
*  convince your colleagues that your segmentation that you have done is right if you don't go
*  and link it to brain atoms? There are many... That's what I call grounding. Because once you
*  start that argument, then you are on safer grounds. I mean, it's a form of evidence that I happen to
*  find compelling. But of course, let's say you're somebody who works just on automatic speech
*  recognition or some natural language processing. There are psychophysical data that might be as
*  compelling for you. So for instance, take experiments, psychophysical experiments that
*  my colleague Odette Gitzha has done at BU. If you take a speech stream and you remove the cues
*  that allow you to have some kind of trunking, then your intelligibility goes away. And if you
*  put in signposts that gives back some kind of rhythmicity in the signal, you get intelligibility
*  back. So those are purely psychophysical data that are consistent with this. We happen to believe
*  that we want to go to neuroscience because we're interested in neuroscience. But psychophysical
*  and computational data are, of course, in my mind, of equal status. You're right that the biological
*  data gives you extra reason to ground it. But these independent forms of data are also legitimate
*  and epistemologically at the same status, I would argue. David, let me push you in a corner now.
*  Okay, please. So here's a quote from you. The things to be explained are human cognitive faculties.
*  So here are my questions. Do we know them? Do we know how many things we need to explain?
*  What authority made up these terms? Isn't that a bit of arrogance by claiming that we know what we
*  are looking for? These days, you probably have noticed also that many papers introduce a
*  problem by saying that in order to solve problem X, the brain must have this or that function.
*  Where does this confidence come from? Brain evolution didn't start out generate a program
*  where the end product should be the human level cognitive faculties. Instead, brains evolved to
*  use actions to learn the consequences of those actions as afforded by a particular environment.
*  The brain is not interested in the true nature of the world. Instead, its main occupation is
*  help its host to survive and prosper in its niche. Do we know at all whether attention, motivation,
*  and so on? These are entities. So when you look at the brain problem from a
*  wider perspective, then these issues inevitably come up. And then we start moving away from the
*  historical aspect of brain research. We started out with the problem of how the mind works. And
*  this is what we have to figure out. And we work our way from the top to the bottom. I think Paul
*  Cizek beautifully also explains why evolutionary concepts are so important as frameworks to
*  understand that a very complex function cannot be unbroken into simple pieces, but it can be
*  put into an evolutionary context. Three bears just ran right by my window.
*  Oh my, black bears. They're running right by my house. Oh, here comes the honk.
*  You're paying attention here. Holy smokes.
*  Black bears?
*  Well, there's no concept of attention according to Yuri, so I can't see them.
*  But that is a game mechanism.
*  I'm going to appeal to my game that I saw these. They're right next to my garage. It's incredible.
*  Three cubs that are big and a big mom. Holy cow. Okay. Sorry. That was very distracting
*  my visual periphery. Sorry about that. Okay. I don't feel pushed in the corner at all by that
*  because I think it's a fair point. And it's exactly the point that I want to push back on
*  you, which is why are you confident in your biological primitives? I think that the concepts
*  we use in the cognitive sciences are hypotheses. I don't think that there's particular arrogance
*  to them. I think that there are hypotheses about the parts list of the mind, just as the Franz
*  Josef Gull list was a hypothesis about the parts list of the mind, except that he made some weird
*  extra assumptions about phrenology, although his organology, I think, is quite fascinating and good.
*  But those are hypotheses that people, I think, are willing, very likely to abandon when we think
*  about the scientific approach. It's unlikely that people are willing to abandon when we use
*  this terminology just to explain at the superficial level human behavior because,
*  I'm hungry, I'm going to meet my wife for lunch, and I'm very greedy, so I'm going to invest in
*  Apple or whatever. But the parts list of the mind is a negotiable. And what is the right granularity
*  of analysis of that parts list is negotiable. I think those are empirical hypotheses. They can be
*  tested neurobiologically, which is what we all want to do, computationally, psychophysically,
*  theoretically. So there's, I think, a rich reason. So just like I'm claiming that you can't be sure
*  that maybe the neuron is the right level of analysis, likewise, you're correct. I can't
*  be sure that attention or language or word recognition is the right level of analysis.
*  And I think those are all up for debate. I think that everything is up for debate.
*  I'm just wanting to point out that a kind of a decomposition of these concepts to the level of
*  things that could be a linking hypothesis is what we're trying to seek to make progress there.
*  Right? So at the level of, let's say, neurodynamics, self-organized systems,
*  the kind of stuff that we can measure and test and so on.
*  So how would the decomposition would work in other areas of cognitive sciences without grounding to
*  the brain? And what comes to my mind is a large other area, which is not cognitive science,
*  but psychiatry. You know, DSM-5, which is the popular and hated big book of my wife,
*  who is a psychiatrist, and many other psychiatrists, is that it's full with terms.
*  And these terms were made in good faith by intelligent people and for a good purpose.
*  So what is the strategy for decomposition unless we go back to the brain and from the brain
*  perspective, we will say, you know, this two or three or four diseases, in fact, has the same
*  mechanism and perhaps the same substrate because they respond to the same treatment.
*  For example, about 20 years ago, people started to, or psychiatrists started to use the drugs that
*  have been used in epilepsy and took a long time to figure out or learn that, oh, the reason why
*  it happens is because many of those psychiatric problems are due to a hyper excitability that if
*  you had a recording from the right part of the brain would be classified by an epileptologist's
*  seizure. So that's one example. So without going into the brain as a classifier and a final
*  arbitrator, I don't know whether we can make progress, of course. But in 2020, I think,
*  you know, you are a prime example that you want to tie your work and research as much as possible
*  to the brain rather than doing decomposition independent of the brain.
*  Again, in the second, okay, no, Paul, go ahead. You had a...
*  Well, no, I don't want to break the flow. Just on a personal note, I recently had Steve Grossberg
*  on the show. And one of the things that we talked about was his sort of cyclic method of developing
*  his theories and his models. And it struck me as I've had it all wrong, you know, thus far,
*  you know, I'm slowly correcting myself as everything's a slow developmental process.
*  But, you know, I have thought, well, you know, like, Yuri, I don't know that you think this way,
*  but like, I think, okay, we have all these brain mechanisms, like, what could they do?
*  And that's sort of a bottom up approach. And then I've also like sort of swam in the like,
*  well, attention, you know, what, how could that relate to consciousness? And how could these
*  psychological terms relate? And then how could they relate to brain? But Steve professes to,
*  and I believe him, because he's done it for a long time, he's been very productive,
*  he begins with the behavior, and he actually seeks out paradoxical behavioral findings,
*  and assimilates and synthesizes a large body of behavioral work from psychological experiments
*  and psychophysics experiments. And then from there spends about five years, he says, thinking.
*  And that leads to design principles that then he can implement in models, and then start thinking
*  about the mechanistic implementation of these things. And because he starts with behavior,
*  it doesn't matter what the terms are for the psychological processes. Likewise, it really
*  doesn't matter what the mechanisms are neuronally, because his claim is that he does it,
*  lets it stew for a long time and thinks about what sort of design principles could implement
*  something like that. And in fact, that he originally started doing that before he knew
*  anything about neuroscience, and I presume about psychology.
*  HOFFMAN I mean, I'm sympathetic to that, right? So just to respond to specific to Steve Grossberg's
*  program with this particular part of his research. And in fact, that is sort of the core part of the
*  paper that John Krakauer, Asif Ghazal, Farah Alex, Gomez-Marin and Malcolm MacGyver and I wrote,
*  that is to say, there is a sort of core of identifying well characterized behaviors,
*  hopefully behaviors that are really interesting to a creature, not like weird animal, not weird
*  lab things that are just highly artificial, but really trying to identify, reviving the ideas of
*  ethology. And so not forgetting the incredibly important contributions from, you know,
*  the von Holst, von Frisch, Tinberg and Lawrence, who really were extremely careful at describing
*  what might be going on, being inspired by that and turning that into experiments in neuroscience.
*  And so we are on record as saying, look, that aspect of extremely thoughtful characterization
*  of behavior should take an equal ground in neuroscience. It should be revived as having
*  this important role for stimulating research. So I think I would be in favor of that kind of view.
*  HOFFMAN So it's a very interesting thing. You know, you just brought up ethology. I started
*  out as an ethologist. I produced ethograms in cats and rats. And because that was the big thing
*  at the time when the Nobel Prize was given to Tinberg and Frisch and Lawrence, who was by the
*  way, a Heideggerberg mentor. And the question in my mind is always that why did it die? Why did
*  ethology die? And the reason is simple because it never tied its systematic exploration to the
*  brain. So here's one example. I spent enormous amount of time as a graduate student, arguing back
*  and forth with others, whether Pavlovian conditioning is a stimulus substitution or it's an epistemological
*  behavior. Is the dog or cat or a rat is approaching the loudspeaker because it is so stupid that it
*  thinks it's food or as the stimulus substitution predicts, or it is because it became a new goal
*  as a result of the contingencies. And this was the time when a term was introduced called
*  auto shaping. Maybe you don't even remember what it is, but basically what it is, is that
*  you put an animal into a box and you present a lever, for example, and all the animal has to do
*  is whenever the lever is presented, it just gets the food automatically. Doesn't have to behave,
*  except the lick. But animals can't help. Rats start pressing the lever. They shape themselves
*  to do what skinner shaped them to do. Pigeons pack on the light source and so on because they
*  can't help. This is how they are put together. Their brain is put together. That without behavior,
*  without action, they learn they never ever get anything. They have to behave in order to receive
*  something. So the debate went on and on and on whether one is the packing behavior or pressing
*  behavior or approaching the loudspeaker is a consumatory behavior or a preparative behavior.
*  And this was unending. I put an electrode in the hippocampus and in an hour the answer was clear
*  because hippocampal theta oscillations are classifying all behaviors into two major
*  categories, preparatory or consumatory. And there was always theta behavior. That was the end of
*  the debate. So I realized in order to make progress, instead of doing ethograms, I should
*  start poking the brain. It's an interesting story. I think you're right. It's interesting
*  that why did ethology and neuroethology not just flourish suddenly and maybe it was this
*  focus on behavior. Although the- Wasn't it? Yeah. Behaviorism
*  intervened and destroyed everything. But not really because behaviorism was prior to that.
*  Behaviorism was killed off in the- This was the 1970s.
*  Behaviorism was effectively killed forever in 1959.
*  Exactly. 1959 was over. There was a- Well, is it because we thought we needed much higher
*  control over the experiments and so everything came into the lab and ethology was discarded
*  because of that? Maybe it's a good- So it does raise interesting problem that we have currently
*  in much of our research, which is this tension between experimental control and naturalism.
*  So on the one hand, the things we would like to understand are the natural class of behaviors
*  that organisms have. And then we bring people into the lab and have them press a button for
*  a Gabor patch tilted to the right, which is- But it's hard to do experiments and naturalistic
*  preps. Well, what killed behaviorism for me or skin areaism is two things. One is the students
*  of Skinner, Breland and Breland, who worked in Hawaii, have published a nice book called
*  Misbehavior of Organism as a response to behavior of organism, which showed that in many, many cases,
*  animals just cannot be trained no matter how many trials you are trying to do. And that is less to
*  Seligman's prepared, contraprepared and unprepared categories that there are certain rigidity
*  in the brain or in evolution that doesn't allow you to train animals, for example, a rat to rear
*  on its hind legs to avoid a shock. This is just naturally incompatible behavior. So the animal's
*  brain is unprepared for that. And then later on learned helplessness and all the others
*  came about. So this totality or globality of ask me any behavior and I can shape it,
*  or I give the brain two different stimuli and the brain can associate anything you want was just not
*  true. And it was very clear. So then the turn went back or the cycle turned back to the idea that you
*  have to look at the brain. What are the constraints of the brain that allow things to happen and what
*  things in the brain does not allow other things to happen?
*  Yeah. I mean, from the perspective of the psychological science and the cognitive sciences,
*  the, you know, Skinner's 1957 book, Verbal Behavior was sort of supposed to be the apex
*  of explaining, you know, complex human function. And in 1959, Chomsky wrote a review of verbal
*  behavior that was effectively a kind of just on logical grounds and examination of could this
*  work in principle on logical grounds. And it was a very, it's the ultimate reviewer number three,
*  if you ever want to read something, career ending read Chomsky 1959. It's very neutral. It's very
*  cold clinical and it also ended behaviorism and psychology that was a one event for the
*  psychological for the cognitive sciences there. So that part didn't work. Interestingly, of course,
*  with respect to AI, that's coming back, right? The notion of, you know, that that you already
*  criticized is that I also relentlessly dislike of this kind of tabula rasa approach
*  is deeply ingrained in the AI approach to these problems. And I find that's going away. Very
*  surprising. It's going away a little bit, but it's sort of still. Well, it's going away to
*  bring his sleep as an offline helper and so on, but it's basically a blank slate.
*  No, but just, but there are priors in the form of the operations performed, you know,
*  so the classic example now is a convolutional neural network, right? Well, it's still randomly
*  initialized. Exactly. It's still that the weights are, but, but there's structure to the,
*  there's structure built into the network. I mean, I'm not saying it's there yet that AI is building
*  in all of the things that, you know, it could, but it's moving in that direction. So for the sake of
*  argument, let's suppose for a moment that the idea that the brain's most important occupation
*  or preoccupation is maintaining its own dynamic and everything comes secondary to that.
*  If you take that, I would say important message of my book, then where is the AI that starts out
*  with that model where you say, Oh, the first thing we have to do is to have a model that can have all
*  the possibilities. It generates a realm of possibilities, what this system can absorb
*  and can code for rather than the other way around. And I don't see it yet.
*  No, but we don't, but neuroscience doesn't know the, the right way, how to construct a realm of
*  possibilities. So it'd be hard for AI to code it in, correct? Well, it's not, I would say we don't
*  know. Yes, but we are making some progress at least. So for example, my ex postdoc Ken Harris
*  showed that the spontaneous patterns in the auditory cortex give you the realm of possibilities.
*  So when you present signals of natural signals, artificial signals, they all fall into this
*  realm of possibilities. There's no boundary violation. You cannot produce anything in the
*  normal brain or in the human brain that is already not there as a dynamic. The most important
*  thing for the brain is to keep that dynamic together. You know, there are so many things
*  that the brain has to, the brain networks have to deal with and they are competing with each other
*  such as stability and reliance and, and perturbational sensitivity and so on. So the only way it can put
*  together is to have this extraordinary diverse conglomeration of dynamic. And the moment
*  you change it, then you have a disease. But learning, no matter how much we learn,
*  the dynamic is not changing. So it is fundamentally different from the tabula rasa approach
*  where, or the AI approach where the complexity of the network scales with the amount of experience.
*  My brain does not, your brain does not. The AI, you know, the shame or the problem is this bug
*  called catastrophic interference. And there are various ways of dealing with it. Now sleep as a
*  saver is perhaps there, but catastrophic interference comes there because of the
*  blank slate model. The brain solved that. And that's why I'm saying that I'd like to see
*  somebody think about to start building a simple thing that can absorb only 500 items, but at least
*  start out with the thousand possibilities rather than start out with zero.
*  That's interesting. That harkens back to the original symbolic AI days where we
*  were going to build in all the expert systems, where you build in all the knowledge. I know
*  it's very different, but it does remind me of that. Since we're on AI, because this is a topic
*  that I wanted to talk about anyway. And Yuri, you just sort of made the case for the inside out
*  approach to building AI. And my question was going to be whether any of this matters for AI.
*  David, do you have a counter to that inside out approach to building AI?
*  I know I'm actually, you and I have talked about this before. I'm actually very sympathetic to
*  Yuri's position on this. I think that's an AI that actually, a kind of neo AI that takes this
*  position into account and evolution for that matter. It would be a very interesting new space.
*  I'm super impressed by what AI systems can do. I think they're amazing and I think they're about
*  engineering. I'm very moved. I'm impressed. I don't think they have anything to do with how minds and
*  brains are organized. I enjoy reading about yet another network and yet another layer of
*  convolutions and pooling. And I have the vaguest idea what it has to do with anything other than
*  it solves an engineering question, but not a question about how biology works or about how
*  minds work. Is it intriguing to you though that, for instance, convolutional neural networks, and
*  I don't mean to harp on this, it's just that that's where the state of the art is.
*  What's what your podcast is about, so you have to actually be...
*  Well, I meant CNNs in particular, but that sort of structure explains a lot of the neurophysiological
*  data seen in the ventral stream. What do you mean with explains? It explains, so let's say the work
*  of Danny Ammons and Jim DiCarlo is an amazingly elegant way to show that you can get at some layer
*  discrimination between visual images. I just don't think that that's what vision is about.
*  No, but when you look at the activity of the units, it matches fairly well with the activity
*  of neurons. And so there's not a complete disconnect there. I mean, there's...
*  No, no. So up to a certain level, no, I think so this is actually an interesting conceptual
*  point is up to a certain level of analysis, those seem like potentially descriptively adequate
*  systems. The question is, are they explanatorily adequate? So they capture good distinctions that
*  some layer of the inferior temporal cortex, you can make discriminations between things.
*  And yes, when you probe at some layer down, some layer of convolution, it looks a little bit like
*  a receptive field. You can even make these cool super stimuli by exploiting the properties of
*  these DNNs. I'll wait for the movie. I'll wait for the movie, but at the moment, I actually
*  rather am in favor of the approach there that Yuri is arguing for, which is let's take it into
*  a very different direction, into a much more pre-formationist direction. As we do know about
*  intrinsic dynamics that are just there. And it would be extremely interesting to see what space
*  that provides and what kind of AI. And yeah, I'm not a big fan of learning. I'm probably way more
*  nativist than you guys, but I'm impressed by what evolution and what genes carry and that they
*  provide an operating system that's so rich that it provides you very clear boundary conditions of
*  which, like the work of Ken Harris that Yuri mentioned, it was extremely interesting. You
*  can't go outside of your coordinate system. And why would you? It would be very weird. I mean,
*  you have a really amazing operating system in the brain, Microsoft brain or whatever it's going to
*  So that is going to be the thing within which you work. You don't give a trillion learning
*  trials of some arbitrary and biology is not the mother of all regressions. That's the daughter
*  of evolution. Okay. So before we go on, because there are some specific claims that maybe we can
*  go through here in a minute, but I want to ask what's at stake in this because does this issue,
*  I'm stepping outside of AI and back to our psychology, high level implementation level
*  psychology brain inside out, outside in discussion. Does this matter issue in the long run? Because
*  science, won't science self-correct either way and progress and work it out regardless of our
*  opinions of how to proceed or, or is this conversation more about speeding up that
*  progress so that we can see it in our lifetimes? So, you know, one level is practical. I can say
*  that we have tried the outside in for a long time and we got to a point where we said the progress
*  is slowing down. And so we can say, why don't you try something else? And the inside out perhaps is
*  an alternative that will induce new data, new ways of thinking and so on. And maybe it will
*  run into the same problem sooner or later. It's hard to predict. So whatever the reason, it is,
*  I think the time is right for now. There are deeper issues. The deeper issues is that the
*  outside in inevitably produces concepts that are difficult to digest. In other words, in order to
*  go from the perception of the world to action, you need some funny thing in the middle that you can
*  call, you know, homunculus or consciousness or decision maker or anything. And that is very
*  difficult to bypass. And as I try to illustrate it in my book, that the way how the outside in
*  approach works is that you put the experimenter in a privileged situation because he's the one,
*  or she's the one, who is presenting the world at the same time recording and interpreting the
*  signals from the brain. So she or he has access to both, but the brain does not. The neurons that
*  you are recording from have no clue what happens out there. That has to be grounded. And grounding
*  is the action. So you need a reader, you need a disciplined way of figuring out whether the
*  correlation that you find is actually utilized by the brain. So in the lab, the not necessarily the
*  mandatory attitude, but at least is the desire is that when we find a correlation, and we have to
*  show that those patterns that we link to behavior actually are read by downstream readers. Now,
*  this brings me back a little bit to AI and especially robotics, or the brain machine interface.
*  Paradoxically or not, the brain machine interface literature or the people who are working on it
*  subconsciously realize how important this is, because they had a reader, the damn cursor,
*  the cursor have to move up or down or somewhere. So there's no negotiation what you have to do,
*  because every single thing that you feed in from the brain has to accomplish a goal. It has to be
*  interpreted by the reader. And so this is the kind of attitude that said if you go and start doing
*  building up the system from the point of readers, then you are much better off than starting from
*  outside and from a higher level and see how the brain responds and trying to interpret you as the
*  experiment of those responses without having a grounding mechanism. So it's not the psychological
*  process you're trying to that's not the object that you're trying to build up a mechanism for,
*  it is the action. Exactly. So I think so your question was, what are the stakes? Does this matter
*  or is this, and there's two answers. One is with Yuri, I agree there are practical concerns.
*  What are the next steps to advance our agenda and asking one of the hardest questions in science?
*  I think the stakes are unbelievably high. The stakes are what is the parts list of the mind
*  and brain? Yeah, back to, yeah. That is what could be a more important list. I want to know,
*  just like physicists want to know what are the elementary particles of how the universe is
*  organized. I want to know what are the elementary particles of how minds and brains are organized.
*  But do you think there's risk that we won't get there or just that we'll get there much,
*  much more slowly if we do it the wrong way? Well, I'm not a, let's say, is there a field called,
*  there's a field called history of science. I don't know if there's a futurism of science.
*  I'm not a science futurist. I'm an optimist. I think that there is a fact of the matter. I'm
*  a naive realist. I believe the world is as it is and we can figure it out. I would like to use the
*  best, put our best foot forward. I think the slightly too casual dismissal of the contribution
*  of the psychological sciences comes at a cost that I don't want to incur. That is the main argument
*  of the paper that Federico and I wrote in response to Yuri's paper and book. That is, it's too
*  quickly dismissing the conceptual architecture of cognition because of course, absolutely true,
*  there's a lot of lame and shitty work. That's legitimate and it's annoying. But there's also
*  progress and good work and we shouldn't, as we said, don't throw the baby out with the
*  bad science bathwater. That is, these are realistic, well-substantiated hypotheses about
*  the elementary particles of the mind and brain and they should have the same kind of status as our
*  hypotheses about whether the neuron doctrine is right or whether everything should be situated at
*  the level of dendritic spine or whether we should be looking in genes. Let me make one more reason.
*  I think the stakes are really high and really exciting and important. We want to know how the
*  basics work in this most fascinating field. One thing I want to disagree with or partially
*  disagree with with Yuri is that the arbiter of everything is action. I think that's certainly
*  part of it but I would submit that one intermediate step and maybe a prior step to that is actually
*  storage. That's one of the remarkable things we have in this sort of pre-configured or pre-formed
*  nervous system, operating system, is the ability to store stuff. Some of it is already there and
*  some of it we have to put in and that forms the basis for many things sometimes including action.
*  I think one of the deepest questions that we owe in the neurosciences and the cognitive sciences is
*  how does storage actually work? It's extremely difficult and I think that the answers we have
*  at the moment strike me as very unsatisfying. It's the pattern of synaptic forms or something like
*  that. That's maybe or maybe not but it seems not. I think that's one of the things for the future
*  to dig in deep because it's going to lie at the basis of the links between how brains work and
*  how minds work which I take to be more or less the same thing. They're different coins of the inquiry.
*  Well, we work on memory but memory and storage is totally useless without action. There's no need.
*  If something in the brain is not implemented and the implementation can happen only through action
*  then it doesn't exist. But is action for you a larger, just a word that also includes thought?
*  Thought is what I call is a deferred action. I was going to ask if memory is a deferred action.
*  Memory is a deferred action too. What is the larger stake? The larger agenda to me,
*  with the inside out versus outside in, that if we build our logical system
*  from the inside out maybe the middle will disappear and those problems that are a large baggage of the
*  outside in such as the little man, such as decision making and all these very difficult concepts
*  will be addressed in a totally different light. Do you have an example how that would work? Well,
*  the example is the way how I view the whole thing differently. So in chapter three I discussed at
*  length corollary discharge, the difference between perception action and action perception.
*  So this asymmetry occurs because every single time the brain sends an output to the actuators
*  or a thought it always signals back to what we call sensory path. And this is the key moment
*  because once the brain figures out and learns how to disengage from the muscles, the same mechanisms
*  can be used for signaling about what if scenarios, what would happen if I would have made this action
*  without actually doing that. And this is called thinking. So starting from the action and going
*  back way. But what are the elements of that? I mean I'm all on board with corollary discharge and in
*  fact it's very close although not identical cousin that you have you know internal forward models
*  that have not just corollary discharge but... Well the internal forward model is a variation of the
*  corollary discharge is a down to earth mechanism. But what are the elements of that? So when that
*  becomes thought I mean those are... So what are the conceptual or representational primitives of that
*  corollary discharge? So we can start with evolution and look how this works in the cricket and then we
*  see how this basic mechanism is getting larger and larger and larger. And I give separate examples
*  in my book is that even emotions are explainable by corollary discharge. I have a chapter that you
*  not a chapter but a paragraph at least there that you didn't criticize that language
*  is probably based on corollary discharge and the thought itself the thought process is based on
*  corollary discharge or this mechanism or something like that mechanism. Yeah I mean the reason I
*  didn't criticize that particular so I'm actually very much in a huge well it's not a notion of
*  fandom. I think that there's something extremely useful about that concept because I myself have
*  done a series of experiments actually on how corollary discharge plays a key role in speech
*  production. And the question whether it scales up and there I know what the primitives are. The
*  question is whether it scales up or scales sideways to other aspects of thought right and that's a more
*  difficult problem. Yeah I agree with that but this is what I try to scale up as an existing mechanism
*  as something that inherited from phylogeny and that can be used and exploited in multiple ways.
*  Yeah no that's an example of where I think there's a really cool mechanism I think for the first time
*  perhaps I've seen in the work of Ernst Mach the physicist talking about that because of eye
*  movement control right so you have to have a copy sent into the future in a quite explicit
*  paragraph in the 1880s or something like that. And then later in the work of von Holst for instance.
*  Right I just want to take a time out and make sure because we're coming to time I suppose
*  just I just want to make sure there's not something that you want to make sure that we get to.
*  But I want to find there's well you were so something intelligent I want to find I have
*  I want to find a quote to really nail him to the.
*  He's pulling out the book. I took some notes here to really you know.
*  Did you want to respond to that Juring? Well I'd like to I plan to say something and I'd like to
*  say no you that it's an interesting thing that we have this debate and about the origin of these
*  words and you would you may wonder why this is so natural that we have this tendency or its urge
*  to come up with words and terms and they the way I try to formulate this is something like this that
*  in every animal semantic information is derived from personal experiences from episodic memories.
*  The first time you see a dog is an episode it's your personal experience but when you see when
*  you come across many dogs the spatial temporal conditions of those specific episodes are stripped
*  off and what is left is a semantic entity of the dog. So learning semantic knowledge typically
*  develops from ego specific ego specific individual interactions this applies to all animals.
*  However and this is a funny part in humans this process is cut short we have
*  externalized not we evolution externalize a great deal of brain functions through artifacts and
*  especially through language so now we can learn explicit semantic knowledge by absorption not by
*  individual episodic memory that is learning from others who name things for us. We learn about
*  giraffes tigers also about angels centa-claws and things like covid the nasdaq index and galaxies
*  and and you can go on now where does this lead to us this is a tremendous advantage
*  but it comes with a cost that we accept their existence the existence of these terms without
*  ever experiencing or questioning them when these terms are used especially by authorities they
*  become real but you may wonder are they really real it is so easy to say that the reason we
*  understand something is because the brain processes information or we can say we sense time and space
*  because we have place cells and time cells in the hippocampus. So these are the statements I have
*  problem with and I illustrate it in various ways and I have a cartoon at the beginning I think in
*  chapter two that the prefrontal cortex has already at least 200 terms that have been associated one
*  way or another with some terms so the reason why we tend to name things is because we have this urge
*  because we think that once we have a word for it that explains so the crux of the problem is that
*  we use words and the terms to explain things that have to be explained this is what I call the
*  mixing of the exponent and exponents and this is I think something that David picked on also and
*  there is I think a fundamental agreement that the two aspects shouldn't be used interchangeably
*  but how we get away from it is the big issue. But isn't part of your agenda to create new
*  vocabulary based on neural principles? New grounded vocabulary I don't necessarily need new words
*  if for whatever reason a new word will clarify things better let's go for it but you know I'm
*  happy to work with the word interneuron that was created a long time ago even though now we know
*  that many garbage neurons have long projection but then we refer to interneurons we already
*  define it we know exactly what we are talking about. I'm no language expert but I mean you get
*  well we do have at least one language expert among us the way that new words are created is not
*  someone doesn't decide to create a new word and then it becomes a new word it's someone it gets
*  it gets used and then something sticks yeah but I think I mean what Yuri is saying I think is
*  we don't need to invent new words we can but we it's the scope of the concepts that a word
*  you know it's the reference or the you know what is the particular meaning of a word that's at stake
*  when we use it in the scientific context. I mean so I think with respect to the explanation question
*  so I want to just narrowly focus on the question of the relationship between you know cognition
*  and the brain. If that is the focus and one of the core parts of neuroscience then I guess
*  you know Yuri points out very early in his book which I have underlined right here
*  the thing to be explained should be the activities of the brain not the invented terms
*  and that's where in I think we that's where that's the implementation and chauvinism
*  that is I think what is to be explained is as importantly is actually the invented terms
*  on the view that the invented terms are just as carefully submitted to scientific analysis
*  research empirical verification that is the terms that we try to understand even something as
*  offensive as attention and can be extremely you know can be subjected to the same level
*  of scientific scrutiny and empirical scrutiny as biology and they are ultimately if we're trying
*  to understand aspects of mental function then those are the things that are the explananda as well
*  not just the activities of the brain and that is I think where we so I would submit that you
*  you must still have some of I don't know if we should call it outside in but that the that level
*  of description needs to be sustained just as the level of description of the neuroscience needs to
*  be sustained and I think that and that the arrow of information cannot just flow from the characterization
*  of the activity of the brain in one direction of the activity of you know psychology or cognition
*  that that that I would feel strongly about. So Yuri mentioned that his hope and he's optimistic
*  that the middle will disappear. Yeah. Maybe you both I don't know if you both want to comment but
*  is there a middle and you know if so will it disappear or will we will it disappear and if
*  there's not a middle I suppose that means you know that the emergent properties that are implied
*  and described when we use psychological terms will forever be separate from the emergent properties
*  that we describe when we use implementation level terms. So is there is there a middle or will it
*  disappear? I'm not sure I understand what the middle is at the moment actually so well so
*  what's the notion of the middle? The notion of the middle is that you know to go from
*  the outside in and to translate what the world is telling the brain to action that has to be
*  the logic goes like this brains are created to learn about the world there are things out there
*  that are good or bad you have to evaluate and you have to choose good and once you make the decision
*  you can act. So this is this serial process which you can call perception decision making
*  and action cycle. I put it the other way around I said there is a action perception cycle there is
*  no perception without action that's a big claim and I try to make it clear why I made it. So the
*  middle is there because it has names question is whether those names really refer to something
*  or not and is the decision making process is a vague idea and that is present and omnipotent
*  in a single neuron because an action potential you can conceive it as a decision and if you make
*  it so ubiquitous then it's no longer capturing those things that philosophers and maybe
*  neuroscientists were talking about. So this is what I'm saying that with that kind of thing
*  it may go away and I hope that if we approach the brain from inside out we may build up a
*  different conceptual system perhaps with different words and different problems to attack
*  than the traditional outside it. I mean I guess what you owe then is a sort of I mean this is a
*  way to answer John Krakauer's question right I mean what you would owe is to say I have a new
*  conceptualization maybe with new or modulated vocabulary that actually can be an account
*  of some mentalist phenomenon. That's John Krakauer's challenge right I mean how would you
*  in the using the infrastructure or conceptual structure or vocabulary of the neuroscientists
*  then account for the psychological phenomenon so you could tell a story that way but you still need
*  to sort of figure out what is that chain of argumentation in that case. I have a feeling
*  that John Krakauer would even if that were to occur he would maintain that the term the
*  psychological processes are on a different level and the vocabulary used are describing different
*  properties of the phenomenon. Again are we talking about the scientific use of the terminology or
*  the informal use of the vocabulary. We will not go away from that right because they are
*  psychologically useful concepts like imagination greed will self are useful that's how we attribute
*  that's sort of the modern computational theory of mind that is your belief system
*  right or knowledge system is that kind of terminology and if you get rid of that
*  what will you put in its place to have a conversation about how we're you know about how we interact
*  and exactly we cannot have a conversation without words. You don't want to get rid of it right?
*  You don't want to get rid of it. We need two things one is to realize that these are conversational
*  pieces the second one is to try to justify them the problem David tried to criticize has been
*  criticized even more so by my psychiatrist wife that one how do you derive from your
*  sodium channels and spines ever depression or even tinnitus. I had a wonderful experience
*  a couple of years ago a rich person from Monte Carlo invited a group of tinnitus experts
*  and neuroscientists who had no knowledge whatsoever about tinnitus and we were imprisoned
*  together for a week and we had to talk about how to solve this problem and you know when you
*  confront yourself with something like this or depression or schizophrenia and said well
*  how many years of my approach at this elementary level would take to get an answer and of course
*  you know I can I have to tell my wife that you know we keep conversation about the words and
*  and modify it as these symptoms and so I allowed them don't wait for neuroscience because then you
*  have to wait for a long period of time but it doesn't mean that's hopeless we are working very
*  hard we are making inroads in various issues and perhaps we can build up someday a vocabulary or a
*  symptomatology or a a drug discovery programs based on brain rhythms every single psychiatric
*  disease is associated with a different constellation of problems of rhythms so what if I can find
*  a drug that will work on a drug that works on the thalamocorico alpha or another one that
*  affects sleep spindles in certain segments of the brain these are neuroscience questions and all of
*  a sudden that kind of drug treatment based on the treatment of the rhythms will fix let's say
*  uh one disease or several diseases simultaneously so this is the kind of far-reaching consequences
*  of the inside out program is it really inside out I just don't see that I just don't I disagree
*  with you on that I mean because you started this with the very interesting point that you know
*  well inside out in a way that you take the brain as your primary target and say oh let's use the
*  the neural mechanism as a testbed to invent a new drug right but you're you're finding I mean what
*  you're saying is you know the really the alluring possibility is that you find a a taxonomy of for
*  instance in this case let's say psychiatric disorders that have shared underlying things
*  let's say because of rhythm changes in brain rhythms or dysrhythmias or arrhythmia but that's
*  because of the presupposition that there would be underlyingly conceptually similarities in the
*  things ultimately underlying the pathology I mean that's a very strong theoretical position
*  that you're bringing to that task I mean that's as outside in as it gets I mean you have a clear
*  theory no the outside it gives you dsm5 dsm5 is full with with a lot of things what I'm saying
*  is that that dsm5 could be grounded by brain mechanisms and maybe simplified uh much more
*  effectively than uh than putting 500 psychologists above the table and negotiate
*  that that must be true on on many reaper many reasons I mean just one just to push your button
*  on one more thing just because you know I was looking through some of my notes and that that
*  came to my mind so there's in your a chapter that for me was very important was just and the paper
*  the chapter on space and time I think it's very you know near and dear to concerns I have
*  you say somewhere I think it's very important because it's also germane to my own
*  particular research interests where I was paying close attention you you say the hippocampal system
*  may be responsible for constructing sequences of information chunks while chunk content is encoded
*  and retrieved from the neocortex and that seems to me a very reasonable hypothesis and worth you
*  know digging deep into the critical question for me is the word content what is the chunk content
*  and how would you actually ask that question and go about it from so I have a clear way of how I
*  would go about it from the putative outside in way but I want to know how you would go about it
*  because it's a little bit mystifying to me well the content is a short list of things that could
*  be simplified in our world by the animal running through a maze and item one is corridor one or
*  the beginning of corridor one and the second one is somewhere else and so on and these segments are
*  concatenated into a sequential order of firing of the neurons so when I have a sequential activity
*  the question is whether those neurons actually represent space or they are pointers to the
*  neocortex where the world is represented or is is mapped and the hippocampal sequence just helps
*  to link together these contents into an episode so this is an example where I would say it's
*  experimentally relatively easy to put your finger on what is the potential contact because that
*  could be measured in centimeters or it could be measured or exemplified with corridors I understand
*  what you're asking is when it comes to a more complicated issue then you would like to know
*  how to break down the content and my answer is always that you know you have to have a
*  simple situation such as an animal running through corridors and then we can go from there
*  yeah I mean I so I certainly see you have a way of operationalizing the question
*  for a very clear experiment in this case of sort of an animal prep and I guess the kind of you're
*  right to point out I would be interested in what content means in a more in a way of what I have
*  actually as stored content right so I have a I have a mental representation of the episode of
*  this discussion and I know that you know you were here and Paul's here and I am here and these are
*  chunks of information presumably neocortical and I want to know well how are those things done and
*  I can then you have a story for how to actually connect those through hippocampal mechanisms into
*  sequences we start talked about this we talked about that we talked about the other thing
*  but for me the the causes connects us the crucial thing is actually the
*  original instantiation of the primitives of this thing like that I have so this is what that's
*  very very difficult to raise in in the I forget which paper you had this review paper that you
*  wrote alone about the problem of alignment and mapping yes that's right and indeed this is an
*  interesting thing because mapping of course is the big preoccupation in the hippocampal research
*  and the hippocampal map assumes that somehow space is mapped onto a hippocampal structure
*  and its mechanisms to serve to represent space the problem with this approach is that space cannot
*  exert any effect any effect on anything because space is a concept only things can affect with
*  physics we have no space sensors in our bodies or in the brain no matter how attractive it is to
*  explain hippocampal function in terms of space in reality we are examining relationships between
*  things and objects and for convenience we refer to them as space but things are not in space
*  space is the things themselves now this is something that we debate among ourselves but
*  I think it somehow relates to what you are saying about the relationship between the
*  primitives and the big concepts of language it's because the big concepts are making up language
*  the language is not this but it is the primitives themselves in a particular constellation and so
*  when you are taking it apart and filling it with new content and tying it to brain mechanism this
*  is what you call alignment and it resonates with me as well and I think we already clarified that
*  I don't think that you have to you know you go blindly in a physiological experiment and then
*  automatically something will come out but you go in with a lot of disciplined or naive
*  primitives and this is what you are trying to find whether it matches to brain mechanisms or not
*  yeah I mean this is sort of what Federico and I would what we're saying well ultimately the
*  day-to-day practice of these experiments is an abductive process that is you have some kind of
*  intuitive notion of what I'm looking for then you really go into the nitty-gritty then you refine
*  the concepts because you sort of you don't do it purely inductively because that has just never
*  worked so this is what I said that there are two major parts of the brain's organization one is
*  what I call the good enough brain and the good enough brain is there for us to do what you just
*  said that under all conditions we have an answer there is always a preconception there is all the
*  brain always knows the answer I cannot show you anything in this world that you would say it
*  doesn't exist because you will automatically say oh this is something like your brain immediately
*  generalizes it interprets it the brain always interprets and this interpretation process is
*  of course what goes into the everyday business when we go into the lab and do experiments that
*  we interpret it and then it requires a particular eye who sees it differently than others that uh-huh
*  this is a little bit different than what we are used to and and you know this is not a hero but
*  the uh no Feynman would say the most important moment in the scientist's life and says it's funny
*  I thought that was Asimov was that Feynman I thought it was Feynman from from the book of
*  professor you are joking or something he might have been quoting Asimov I don't know
*  I don't have a stake in it but the I think I agree with the principle that indeed that's what we
*  do because that's the discovery process that all of a sudden our preconceptions are confronted with
*  something and and this is I think the what mainstream neuroscience should do now is taking
*  those concepts that we inherited and confront them and see if we get some surprises here and there
*  I mean if you didn't have a preconception going and you would never have the surprise moment
*  it's because you approach it with a preconception you say huh I wonder what that's all about right
*  otherwise it would be just description description description stamp collecting
*  it would just be stamp that also goes in in neuroscience these days yes yeah I wanted to
*  spend more time on abduction because I think I really enjoyed that that later piece in your
*  article David but we got to go and this is always the the risk you run when you have a couple people
*  who are almost as smart as france joseph gall but not quite you know we could clear
*  we could just go on and anyway but I hope that we move the needle and at least gave people food
*  for thought and you know of course I'll point people to both your papers that that series of
*  articles and the introductory article and and your your book which is again wonderfully done
*  so thank you for the book and thanks for the I mean I do think you know like I said at the very
*  beginning I think it's I hope you can say something but the just it's really just
*  unbelievably useful to have debates go back and forth right I mean even this is because you know
*  both you already had the experience I've had the experience with with students and trainees who
*  just they are uncomfortable about debate now and we and it's exactly the opposite that you should
*  have right to serve say well I just I'm just not understanding I need to look at it from different
*  and that's kind of fun it's engaging and it's I think it's part of our sort of professorial
*  responsibility say that we we get joy from that but people debate in a different way these days
*  it seems like more name calling and definitive statements rather than I think this therefore
*  that it is you are this because that you know it's so it's a well that's yeah okay but that's kind
*  of lame it's lame but it's I think that that might be a reason why people are less I don't know I
*  don't really know the other thing I think is the lack of time you know discussing a paper
*  for me and for my group 30 years ago it took a day now we are we are discussing two papers
*  in a in a lab meeting yes so here is a deal David we will pick a paper of yours
*  and we will invite you to present it yes that's a good idea my group is a little more vicious than
*  the average group and they will but they're probably like they will take your part they're
*  probably like my group my lab my lab meetings get very vigorous it's fun no that's exactly I
*  would love to think so anyway guys I'm sorry we ran out of time thank you so much for the
*  fascinating conversation and you know hopefully maybe we can do it again sometime who knows
*  thank you so much for organizing this and thankfully the outside comments and thank
*  you David for your effort and your kindness and your criticism thanks thanks Yuri for
*  tolerating me thanks Paul for organizing it and I look forward always to more it's great fun and
*  it's important
