# BI 068 Rodrigo Quian Quiroga: NeuroScience Fiction
**Brain Inspired:** [April 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXBPGUTFi30)
*  There has to be something that is radically different between what our neurons do and
*  what the chimpanzee neurons do.
*  How we encode information and how chimpanzees encode information.
*  I will argue that maybe these concept cells have something to do with that.
*  Because concept cells encode information in a completely different way compared to place
*  cells in rats.
*  There's an underlying question that is all over the book, which is basically what makes
*  us human.
*  If you want to put it like in one sentence, what is it?
*  What makes me different from HAL 9000, from a supercomputer?
*  And what makes me different from other animals?
*  What is it?
*  What is it in our brain that makes that?
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hey everyone, this is Paul Middlebrooks.
*  Welcome to Brain Inspired.
*  Today my guest is neuroscientist Rodrigo Kean Kioroga, who's the director at the Center
*  for Systems Neuroscience at the University of Leicester in the UK.
*  Rodrigo is known best in neuroscience for his discovery of concept cells, or Jennifer
*  Aniston neurons, as they're known in the media.
*  But he's also the author of multiple popular science books.
*  And today we talk about his most recent book, Neuroscience Fiction.
*  I won't read the super long subtitle, but it's a really fun book.
*  He uses popular sci-fi movies like 2001, A Space Odyssey, The Matrix, Minority Report,
*  and a bunch of others.
*  He uses these as introductions into deep topics like free will, identity, mind reading, immortality,
*  consciousness, all the good stuff.
*  And for each of these topics, he takes the reader through their history and philosophy
*  and what modern science and neuroscience has to say about them.
*  So our conversation is wide ranging and we touch on a handful of the topics from the
*  book.
*  But we start with concept cells and their role in intelligence and how they're related
*  to other cell types described in the hippocampus, like the well-known place cells and grid cells
*  studied in navigation tasks.
*  And as we talk about his book, concept cells keep coming up as a key to what makes us human
*  and perhaps a key to our general intelligence and awareness.
*  I link to the book and relevant papers in the show notes at braininspired.co.
*  If you'd like to recommend a guest for the show, as many listeners have, send an email
*  to paul at braininspired.co or I'm on Twitter at pgmid, P-G-M-I-D.
*  Okay, enjoy Rodrigo.
*  Rodrigo, welcome and thanks for talking with me today.
*  Pleasure.
*  So you seem happy.
*  So you wrote this book, neuroscience fiction, and I've read your previous works as well.
*  My judgment is that you're a happy person.
*  Am I right?
*  That's great.
*  I mean, it's great to hear that.
*  If I give you this impression, that sounds very good.
*  Okay.
*  Well, yeah.
*  So you wrote this book, neuroscience fiction.
*  I love the book, by the way.
*  It's actually, it's interesting.
*  I found myself sort of rooting for you because it's, you really weave in so much and sort
*  of effortlessly, it's impressive how you weave in and out of current science, of course,
*  but also historical literature and the philosophy and you revisit and cycle throughout the entire
*  book.
*  And I found myself rooting for you because there's just so many examples of, classic
*  examples of scientific discoveries and stories.
*  As I'm reading about, for instance, a particular movie and I'm thinking, oh, what experiments
*  is he going to bring up here?
*  And then sometimes you did and I thought, ah, I got it right.
*  And then other times you'd bring up many others.
*  So anyway, congratulations on the book.
*  Thanks.
*  And maybe that's the reason why I look happy because it's really like a privilege, I think,
*  to be able to do what we like.
*  And I really enjoy that.
*  Writing a book for me was not just to get the book out, it was also that I enjoy every
*  single bit of all this time that I spent writing it because I was digging into things that
*  really interest me and I was trying, as you said, to interweave them.
*  And I don't see why scientists, we have to stick to the scientific facts.
*  We cannot get out, reach out to arts and literature and philosophy to try to get a deeper knowledge.
*  And I really enjoy that.
*  It's really difficult to string four or five words together and make sense.
*  So to put, to weave all these things together, it's a lot of work.
*  So it's really impressive.
*  I guess you are known for concept cells.
*  Would I, would that be accurate?
*  Yep.
*  Also known as Jennifer Aniston neurons.
*  So I'm known as the Jennifer Aniston neuron guy.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you, how do you like being known as the Jennifer Aniston neuron guy?
*  It's okay.
*  It's fine.
*  I mean, it's, I can't complain.
*  I mean, this somehow made up my career, no?
*  I mean, after finding this, I don't know, I started talking to the big pops in neuroscience.
*  They were interested in my stuff.
*  I got a good job.
*  I got promoted.
*  I got grants.
*  I got very good papers out.
*  So I cannot, I cannot regret it.
*  I mean, on the contrary, I'm very happy that this happened and I'm very lucky, I think,
*  to have found something that people find interesting.
*  Should we talk about concept cells and get them out of the way?
*  Are you sick of talking about them after all these years?
*  No, no, I love talking about that.
*  I mean, no, no, no.
*  I mean, I love it.
*  I, what I don't like sometimes is where people will just stick to Jennifer Aniston and they
*  only want to know about the Jennifer Aniston neuron.
*  And because it's so flashy or it was so flashy, at least for some time, that it really, I
*  mean, it took me a lot of effort when I was giving talks to get people out of that and
*  go into a really deeper connotations of the finding because people were interested in,
*  oh yeah, but the neuron did not fire to Brad Pitt.
*  How cool and this and that.
*  And they say, well, forget about that.
*  I mean, that's funny.
*  That's interesting.
*  We can have a laugh about that, but think about it.
*  I mean, these neurons are really telling us a lot.
*  Forget about Jennifer Aniston and all these actors, Luke Skywalker, and take a minute
*  to really think about what this really means.
*  And then it gets really interesting.
*  And I will never get tired to discuss that.
*  On the contrary.
*  Well, you know, I wasn't even going to mention the name Jennifer Aniston.
*  You brought it up, but, but, but you can't help it because that's what people go to.
*  I wasn't going to mention it because I think ideas are more interesting and I think a lot
*  of people think people are more interesting.
*  And you know, we have this celebrity geared culture and it's, I don't know, it's disgusting
*  to me, but, but, but the reason why it is actually I look for that.
*  I mean, I cannot say, oh, I found this by chance.
*  No, I really look for that because people were doing experiments before.
*  I mean, I should start by explaining the setting.
*  So these are patients that, I mean, they have their candidates for an epilepsy surgery,
*  which means like a resection of the epileptic focus.
*  These are epileptic patients.
*  They cannot be treated with medication and the surgeon and the team of clinicians to
*  try to, to localize where the seizures come from and then evaluate the possibility of
*  a surgical resection.
*  They will put electrodes inside the brain, intracranial electrodes.
*  And I mean, due to several technical details, we can record single neurons from them.
*  And the first thing I saw is I interacted a lot with the patients.
*  I talked to them and they're normal people.
*  They're not just patients as like people coming from another world.
*  They're very normal people and they're not scientists.
*  So they don't care about maybe scientific facts.
*  They care about celebrities and they watch the time.
*  This person watched friends and she knew Jennifer Aniston, she knew Brad Pitt, she knew Oprah
*  Winfrey and I said, well, if they're thinking about this more than Albert Einstein or Heisenberg
*  and so on, well, this is the type of things I should use because these are the things
*  that are familiar to them.
*  And the chance of getting neurons fired into these people is much higher.
*  And this is exactly what happened.
*  Now the interesting twist of these concept cells, so Jennifer Aniston neurons is they
*  fire two concepts.
*  And what do I mean with that?
*  The interesting part of the Jennifer Aniston neuron as the Luke Skywalker neuron and many
*  others, the Oprah Winfrey neuron is that it will fire say to Jennifer Aniston no matter
*  which picture I show of her.
*  So I showed seven different pictures of her from seven different views, seven different
*  haircuts and so on.
*  And the neuron fired to all the pictures of her and to no other picture.
*  And that's very interesting because you say, well, why would I have a neuron firing to
*  her no matter how I show her?
*  And this is something that nobody could find in monkeys and people have been trying that
*  for decades.
*  And nobody could find a neuron that fires to a particular person no matter what.
*  And then that was the first interesting puzzle.
*  And that's when things start getting very interesting for me because why would I have
*  neurons firing to specific concepts in an area that is known to be involved in memory?
*  Because these neurons are mainly in the hippocampus, which we know since decades that is critical
*  for memory.
*  And that's when the discussion got very interesting.
*  And that's what somehow sparked or trigger, I would say, my whole scientific career since
*  I mean in the last 15 years.
*  I'm just curious, where were you pointed before that?
*  Oh, I was, I changed a lot.
*  So I studied physics in Argentina.
*  That's my country.
*  And then I did a PhD in applied math in Germany.
*  And then I did a postdoc in dynamical systems.
*  So I was working with chaotic system and modeling and so on.
*  And I was doing well.
*  I mean, it was it was I think was good stuff.
*  But then I had the chance to get a Sloan Fellowship, which was particularly targeting people from
*  hard sciences to switch to neuroscience.
*  And I kind of like draw a line and I say, well, all the stuff that I did in physics
*  and applied math, that's it.
*  And I really want to get into brain.
*  And I confess, at the time I started in Caltech, I was already like a senior postdoc.
*  I really didn't know what a neuron was or how a neuron.
*  But I knew what neurons are, but I didn't know anything.
*  I didn't know anything about the physiology of neurons, action potential and so on.
*  So I started learning from scratch and I really enjoyed it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a lot of people seem to come from the physics background and point of view.
*  But I mean, neuroscience is so young, everyone comes from somewhere.
*  So hardly anyone started in neuroscience, you know, because it's almost like neuroscience
*  isn't even a thing, but it's becoming a thing, I suppose.
*  I agree.
*  OK.
*  So we're going to talk about concept cells a little bit.
*  And I don't know, maybe we should, should we talk about hippocampus in the hierarchy
*  of brain areas, regional hierarchy of visual processing and processing in general?
*  Yeah.
*  So, I mean, if this classic, I mean, neuroscientists will know exactly what I mean when I mentioned
*  the word van Essen.
*  So there's a classic diagram from van Essen and colleagues where you see like all these
*  hierarchies of brain areas starting in the retina, hierarchies for visual processing,
*  for processing of visual information.
*  When you start in the retina, then you go to the lateral geniculate nucleus, then you
*  go to primary visual cortex and areas B1, B2, B4, inferior temporal cortex and so on.
*  And what is striking, sometimes I like to show this diagram just to show, look, the
*  hippocampus is at the very, very top.
*  So there are dozens of areas and hippocampus is at the very end.
*  I think this is a bit misleading because the information processing doesn't end in hippocampus.
*  It's just kind of like a half and then it goes back.
*  You have feedback and you can go to prefrontal cortex and you have many other connections.
*  So it's not ending there.
*  It's not like an homunculus reading all what the other area says.
*  But the key point that I like to make when I show this plot is that, look, I mean, there's
*  nothing magical about hippocampus suddenly having these concept cells.
*  It's just that hippocampus is reading information that has been processed by dozens of areas
*  before it.
*  So you can expect that the coding in this area is something or could be something quite
*  refined because these areas are reading out the inputs from other areas, which in turn
*  are reading out the inputs from other areas and so on.
*  So the information has through several stages before reaching hippocampus.
*  And therefore, we do find in hippocampus, you will not that respond to concept.
*  That will respond to Jennifer Aniston no matter what or Oprah Winfrey.
*  And even if I say the name of the person or if I write the name, so I have a new one falling
*  to Oprah Winfrey will fire to any picture of her.
*  And even if I will write the name Oprah, then you know will fire or if I will say the name,
*  then you know will fire.
*  So it's very, very high level abstract representation of the particular concept.
*  There's been a lot that's been found in hippocampus.
*  Like you said, it's very well known that memory is very important function of the hippocampus.
*  And I guess in the last, well, I don't know how many years it's been now, but everyone
*  studying place cells and grid cells in the hippocampus and spatial cognition.
*  So since 1971.
*  Well, yeah, that's when that's when it started.
*  But it seems like it's just now sort of really exploded because of the Nobel Prize.
*  Yeah, I think.
*  So how do you think of concept cells in relation to place cells and grid cells?
*  And I haven't even said what those are.
*  So it might be helpful to say what those are as well.
*  So I mean, what you say is a very interesting question.
*  That's something that really interests me a lot.
*  So there were like two fields that until recently, recently, maybe a few years,
*  except some people that were visionaries like the late Howard Eichenbaum, they developed in parallel.
*  So from patient HM in the 1950s, studied by Brenda Miller and Sue Corkin and other people following them.
*  We know that hippocampus in humans, at least, is a symbolic memory.
*  If you don't have the hippocampus for a lesion or something, you just cannot form your memories.
*  You end up like the guy in memento.
*  Now, on the other hand, since the 1970s, we know for a fact that hippocampus is involved in spatial navigation.
*  And these are experiments that have been done in rats and in mouse later on and since more recently in bats.
*  So we know that hippocampus kind of has that kind of like the GPS of the brain.
*  So in order to be oriented, to know where you are and how to navigate, for example,
*  to go to the shop or to something, you do need hippocampus.
*  But then like then it's this big puzzle.
*  I mean, you have one field of people studying human hippocampus and hippocampus is involved in memory.
*  And then you have the other group of people saying hippocampus is involved in spatial navigation.
*  It's the same area and it's not that different.
*  So if you see the rat hippocampus and the human hippocampus, the kind of overall structure is very similar.
*  Now, my point is my starting point is because I think we will discuss a lot about that.
*  My starting point is, OK, in the rat hippocampus, you do have neurons that fire to specific locations of the environment,
*  to particular places. And this is what we call place cells.
*  Then later on, and most are discovered what we call grid cells, which is kind of like a distribution of places,
*  like with a grid type of shape that they tile the whole environment and so on.
*  And my point is that a special location in an environment that is very familiar to the rat, it is a concept.
*  So, for example, in my office, the place where my sofa is located, it is a concept.
*  And I will remember doing things in my sofa, I mean, sitting in my sofa that I didn't do sitting in front of my computer,
*  which is another place and it's another concept.
*  And for rats, knowing exactly where they are is crucial because they have to know if they are close to like a runaway place
*  or if they are in danger or where food is and so on.
*  So the location for a rat is crucial. And also, rats do not see like us.
*  So we can see at the distance. So we we don't need to know to have a map, I mean,
*  to go to a particular place close by because we can see it.
*  But a rat cannot see a distance. So therefore it has to have a representation to go from one place to the other.
*  But the point is we both have somehow a representation of concepts.
*  For a rat, it's more a representation of places because this is more important for them.
*  And for a human, it's a representation of specific people or places or salient things because we tend to form memories about these things.
*  But you tend to. So place cells are concept cells.
*  So there's a worry that everything will be collapsed into a concept every single idea.
*  No, but this I guess we'll talk about this later. We can talk about it now.
*  There's a huge difference. They're very, very different.
*  So a few years ago, I would say, yeah, they are similar.
*  Now we say, no, they're completely different. Place cells and concept cells.
*  Yes, place cells, they respond to concepts.
*  But the way place cells encode concepts is exactly the opposite to how concept cells in humans encode concepts.
*  So they both encode. I mean, if you see a place as a concept, they both encode concepts in a way, either places or particular people.
*  But the way they do encode these concepts is radically different.
*  And I think this is leading to, I mean, some research that I'm more interested now, which is where my research is going these days,
*  which is trying to find out what are the specific neural principles that are the basics of human memories and human intelligence.
*  And I think it's very different in rats than in humans and even than in monkeys.
*  Are abstract ideas encoded in the same way as invariant person representations, let's say, in concept cells?
*  If I attract ideas, you mean like abstract concepts, like, for example, I don't know,
*  happiness or gravity and these things.
*  I think these concepts are more encoded in cortex, in neocortex, not in hippocampus.
*  I think hippocampus is critical for episodic memory, memory of our lifetime, of our experiences.
*  Whereas neocortex in different areas of neocortex, you have more semantic memory, memories of fact.
*  So knowing that Paris is the capital of France, which is a classic example, is something that is not dependent on hippocampus.
*  I can remove hippocampus of one person and the patient or the person will still know that Paris is the capital of France.
*  But now if I repub the hippocampus of one person and I say, what did you do yesterday?
*  The person would not know. I mean, because these memories are hippocampal dependent.
*  So I think abstract concepts are encoded in neocortex, not in hippocampus.
*  And the coding in neocortex tends to be more distributed.
*  I think hippocampus is more, I mean, it's more technical, but it's more sparse.
*  So you have you tend to have more specific neurons dedicated to the concepts, whereas in hippocampus,
*  you will have a big bunch of neurons with a distributed representation that are encoded, these abstract semantic concepts.
*  But the representation is very different.
*  And the reason is because in hippocampus, you tend to form these memories that you can form on the fly.
*  And for that, it's known from modeling studies that the best you can have is a sparse representation to have specific neurons dedicated to them.
*  Why? Because then you can create associations between different concepts on the fly in one go.
*  But now, if you have a representation that is distributed across many neurons and each neuron will go different details in different ways of the particular concept,
*  then making an association between two concepts takes time.
*  You cannot do it on the go. You cannot do it on the fly because then everything collapses.
*  And I think that's why we have different coding principles for these abstract concepts in cortex, like happiness and so on or gravity,
*  and a different type of representation for specific people or places and so on that you can create quickly associations,
*  which are the basics of our episodic memories.
*  And is this where the complementary learning system ties in as well?
*  Exactly. Exactly. I see this as exactly as the complementary learning system.
*  Which basically is like a quick, veritable memory happening in hippocampus.
*  And then things get consolidated and detailed, oriented in the cortex, essentially.
*  Exactly.
*  Which came first, language or concept cells?
*  And how do you see them relating? Because language is...
*  Well, so you've mentioned that only humans have these concept cells that we know of anyway.
*  So far, yeah.
*  Maybe snails do, who knows?
*  And only humans have language.
*  Yeah. I mean, I think these two things, it's not a coincidence.
*  And that's why I like, I mean, going back to the start of our conversation, that's why I like digging into other fields.
*  And I got this through a very famous writer from Argentina called Jorge Luis Borges.
*  Yeah.
*  And Borges has a few stories, short stories.
*  He always wrote short stories where he made very clearly how language impacts our thinking.
*  And for example, imagine a world called Tron, Tron.
*  Sorry, I said again, Tron, in a short story called Tron, Udvar or Vistertius.
*  And this is a world where there are no nouns.
*  And everything is said as a superposition of adjectives.
*  And then Borges concluded that in this world, it was not possible to think or science.
*  He says science was not possible, not even thought, thinking.
*  And why? Because he argued that every noun is an aberration on itself,
*  that to pronounce a noun means to get rid of silliness of details and to focus on the essential.
*  So if I say horse, I don't mean a particular horse of a particular color,
*  a race horse or a horse to pull it, I mean, to pull a chart or so on.
*  I just mean the concept horse.
*  So the fact that I'm using nouns, that I'm using language,
*  it's kind of like reinforcing the ability to think in terms of abstractions.
*  And then that's the part I enjoy a lot.
*  I started reading a lot about evolutionary biology.
*  I mean, how comes that suddenly we have language and then how come that we suddenly have concept cells?
*  And I mean, it is not very clear, but maybe language evolved since 100,000 years or so with homo sapiens.
*  And I think we do have concept cells and so far we cannot find them in other species or monkeys
*  because we have evolved with the use of language since tens of thousands or maybe even 100,000 years.
*  And the fact that we have evolved with the use of language created concept cells.
*  And the fact we have concept cells reinforce the use of language.
*  I think both things, they co-evolve in parallel.
*  So maybe we can use language because we have concept representations and concept cells,
*  which at the same time can be created because we use language.
*  So I think both things evolve in parallel.
*  Well, you need the concept of an abstract entity for language.
*  You need nouns, I suppose, for language to really be effective because you need these concepts to associate with other concepts.
*  And so, yeah, it's a chicken or egg problem, which came first concept cells for language.
*  Yeah, I see them.
*  I mean, I don't think like at some point in time we started speaking English or Germanic or whatever language we spoke in the past.
*  Maybe at first we started naming some things, maybe with some sounds or something.
*  And then particular sounds mean specific concepts, like in Asian times.
*  And due to our vocal cavity, we have the ability to speak, which a monkey doesn't have or a chimpanzee doesn't have.
*  They can do sounds, they can do different type of screens, but they cannot properly speak.
*  And the fact that we can speak give us a huge repertoire of different sounds or words, if you like,
*  that we can pronounce and we can refer to different things.
*  So maybe at first we started naming things, but without having a refined language.
*  And these started creating a different representation in these memory areas.
*  And the fact that we have this representation reinforce creating a more sophisticated language and so on.
*  So I think it was a virtuous loop that somehow created this phase transition that differentiated us from other species.
*  Well, it did allow you to write this book.
*  Let's talk about neuroscience fiction.
*  So the concept of the book, concept, I got to stop saying concept.
*  The idea in the book is you run through every chapter is sort of framed around a sci-fi film.
*  And are you a big sci-fi fan, it seems like?
*  Yeah.
*  And you use the film really just as a starting point to then dive into various concepts in our intelligence and in our minds and brains.
*  So just to list off a few, there's Blade Runner, there's Planet of the Apes, there's The Matrix,
*  there's Until the End of the World, which I've never seen, but I had the soundtrack.
*  I think a lot of people had that.
*  It was a really good soundtrack in that movie.
*  So and on and on, Minority Report.
*  You know, first of all, I'm just curious, like, how did you choose these?
*  You know, what's the what's the movie that you left out that you wish you could have included?
*  Oh, there are a few. I mean, I basically chose my favorite movies.
*  I mean, Until the End of the World is not it's not that known, but it's one of my favorite.
*  It's one of my overall favorite movies, not just science fiction movies, movies of all the movies I have seen.
*  I love I love this movie because I love the soundtrack.
*  And I think Bim Benders, the director, did an amazing job of putting together this
*  the soundtrack with some beautiful shots.
*  And I love it. And on top of that, there's a very nice scientific story going on,
*  which actually gave me an idea for an experiment that I published 10 years ago.
*  So but I chose movies that I love.
*  I mean, I chose movie that I would like to investigate deeper.
*  I mean, further that I would like to write about.
*  There are some exceptions. There are some movies I do not like that much, but they are there
*  for some reasons, which I can come through in a minute.
*  And there's some movies that are left out.
*  I mean, like, I would have liked to have a chapter on Terminator.
*  But I found out I found out that to make the philosophical point I wanted to make,
*  which is very deep, I instead of Terminator, I needed Robocop.
*  And I love Terminator. I don't like that much Robocop.
*  I think Robocop is it's OK.
*  I mean, it's not horrible, but it's not one of my favorite movies by far.
*  But Robocop makes very, very clearly the point of what determines identity.
*  Is it our body or is it our brain?
*  Or if you want with the brain, our memories.
*  Whereas in Terminator, this point is not there because Terminator is a robot.
*  I mean, you wouldn't define identity of a robot.
*  I mean, you would define identity of a person.
*  So if suddenly you change all my body parts
*  and you replace them by some cybernetic robotic parts, will I still be myself?
*  What is it that makes the difference?
*  And I really wanted to get into this discussion.
*  I really love this philosophical discussion.
*  And Robocop was leading me straight into the discussion,
*  whereas I couldn't I couldn't really interweave Terminator in this discussion,
*  as I would have liked to.
*  You roll your eyes. Oh, I've got to use Robocop.
*  Yeah. But there's a point in the movie that I love, which is
*  in the remake of Robocop.
*  I mean, there's a point where Robocop sees what is left of his body and the guy freaks out.
*  And it's a very, very dramatic scene.
*  The guy freaks out. What am I?
*  I mean, what happened to me? What happened to me?
*  And it's very clear because the guy says the guy really, I mean,
*  clearly makes a point that I am my body.
*  And this is a huge philosophical discussion.
*  Are we our body or are we our brain?
*  And I think that's that's a misleading dichotomy because the brain is also part of the body.
*  But am I my body if you want or am I my memories, my experiences?
*  So, yeah, that's why I have to choose Robocop.
*  Yeah. I mean, you tie in just speaking of historical ideas and literature,
*  you tie directly into that the idea of rebuilding.
*  I believe it's directly into that rebuilding a ship out at sea board by board.
*  And then is it the same ship afterward?
*  I don't remember what what source that's called.
*  That's the paradox of the seers.
*  So it's a beautiful story because it's a very ancient Greek story.
*  So the King Minos used to get 20 young,
*  I mean, 10 young men and 10 young women to go to the to the island of Delos.
*  I'm trying to remember because I haven't read this for a while.
*  There's so much in the book. It's.
*  Yeah, it's hard to remember.
*  But basically, legend says that King Minos used to get 20 young guys and girls
*  from Athens into the island of Delos to go into a labyrinth where they will be
*  caught and eaten by the Minotaur, half bull, half person.
*  And then Teseus, one time was an Athenian hero,
*  will go with these young guys and girls and will kill the Minotaur.
*  And then he will come back and then he will come back triumphant in his ship.
*  And therefore, for hundreds of years, people from Athens, they will remember
*  this big thing that Teseus did and then they will play the sea to the ship
*  and they will they will sail it to the island of Delos to remember this big thing.
*  Now, the paradox of the sailor ship is that after hundreds of years,
*  of course, the ship started deteriorating.
*  And then they say, well, I mean, let's replace some planks which are getting
*  rotten by new ones. And then the question is, well, is it the same ship or is it
*  a different ship because you are replacing part of it?
*  And that's a nice twist.
*  And I think it was Thomas Hobbes that did a nice twist and said, well, not only that,
*  there was a very clever guy that was getting every plank from the old ship,
*  was bringing it to another harbor and was rebuilding the original ship.
*  Right. Right. And then the question is, so which one is the ship of Teseus,
*  the one that they got rebuilt with the original planks or the one that is going
*  every year to the island of Delos? And it's exactly the same discussion.
*  Is it the material component, is the material part what makes identity or is it
*  the function? Same as body and memory, body and function.
*  Well, Rodrigo, I mean, there is just so much from the book, it's impossible to know
*  where to start. So I kind of want to ask you, and then we can just use this as a
*  jumping off point, you know, what was, which chapter was the most fun for you to
*  write and why?
*  I don't know if they said chapter that was the most fun.
*  There are parts of chapters that I really enjoyed.
*  There were parts of chapters that were difficult for different reasons.
*  Well, it's not like they're independent because that's all weaved together.
*  So it's not like. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So, for example, I mean, if you ask me, I love writing about until the end of the
*  world. And actually, I was I will mention him because I was having I have a very
*  good friend and colleague in Barcelona and I was visiting him.
*  And I remember we were having lunch looking at the sea.
*  I would both like this movie.
*  And then we were remembering another movie from Bender School, the Himmlerue Berlin,
*  Wings of Desire. And if you watch the German original movie, it's beautiful.
*  If you watch the Hollywood remake, it's not that nice.
*  But and we're remembering that and then we say, oh, man, I have to write about this
*  movie. And this is about two angels that they go around in Berlin and they can read
*  the mind of people and what they want to know these two angels is how is it to be
*  human? How is it to live?
*  What are humans thinking about?
*  What are their daily worries and things that they care about and so on?
*  And it's beautiful. It's so poetic.
*  And this got me straight into discussing about the possibility of mind reading.
*  Can we read the mind? Can can do some measurements of brain activity?
*  Guess what somebody's thinking about.
*  And there are many experiments that are breathtaking that you should read about.
*  You say, wow, can we really do that?
*  And yes, we can. So I love talking about that, for example.
*  But I don't know, for example, in the chapter that I discussed, Free Will, I really
*  enjoyed talking about the determinism because this brought me back to things that I
*  studied when I was a physicist.
*  Chaos theory and dynamics.
*  Yeah, but even before that, I mean, I talk about the 17th century scientific revolution,
*  which I love reading about when when I was a physics student.
*  So I will talk about, I don't know, Kepler and Galileo and Newton and how suddenly
*  this these guys create a revolution, which we call, I mean, I mean, like
*  classical mechanics and so on.
*  And it was a new paradigm.
*  And they changed the way we think in terms of physics.
*  And what I didn't know before when I studied physics, which I learned much later, is
*  that these things, they went together with a whole revolution, because at the same
*  time, the cart was changing philosophy and the cart didn't wake up one day and say,
*  OK, I want to build up a new philosophy.
*  The cart realized, well, our scientific knowledge is changing dramatically because
*  physics is changing. I mean, what we think about how the world works is changing
*  dramatically. So maybe how deep does this go?
*  And then he changed philosophy.
*  And then, I mean, he's the the cart is known as the father of modern philosophy.
*  So I love talking about that because this leads to determinism and determinism leads
*  to free will. I mean, if everything is determined, I mean, how can we be free?
*  Right. And I love discussing that.
*  And this brings me to chaos theory at the end, because I think chaos theory is the
*  solution. And chaos theory is what I studied when I was doing my my post grad in
*  physics. But on the other hand, I mean, the other side of the coin is that I didn't
*  enjoy much thinking the whole time about free will because it's a very nice it's
*  a very nice philosophical discussion.
*  But as I say, in the acknowledgments, I mean, in the last pages of the book, it
*  left me with this feeling of emptiness.
*  Yes. Well, why?
*  I mean, why would I make something if I'm not in control?
*  And you know that you are in control because.
*  But anyway, I mean, you're always thinking about these things.
*  And sometimes you get this this feeling.
*  I mean, I just want to get out of that.
*  Yeah. Let's just spell out your your conclusion about how free will is saved by,
*  I guess, complexity and chaos.
*  So, I mean, the the bottom, I mean, the quick, the quick and punchy answer is that
*  there's no free will as we think as we think.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And basically all what I'm doing is determined by the activity of my
*  neurons, which is determined by what my neurons did before and what is happening
*  around me and what is happening around me is also deterministic.
*  And if you think about that, what will be the alternative?
*  So if it is not if it is not deterministic, what is it?
*  Is it random? But if it is random, it's also not free will.
*  That's the way I totally like to think about that.
*  You say, well, I mean, everything is predetermined, but there's there's some
*  noise in the system. But that, I mean, that's very different from thinking like,
*  oh, I have I mean, I'm in control of my stuff and by some magic process, I can
*  decide what I will do. No, don't decide like this.
*  I mean, is your neurons being activated?
*  And then you are conscious of what is happening with your neurons.
*  And this is what we call free will.
*  And actually, we know that if this illusion doesn't exist, this can lead to very serious
*  pathologies like schizophrenia.
*  Right. And somehow this feeling of emptiness, knowing that you are not in control
*  in a decart way, that you do have a mind that is autonomous and is deciding and then
*  your body is implementing this decision that is just neurons firing in a particular way.
*  This is saved by chaos theory, because, OK, even if we're not, I mean, if there's
*  not something mysterious making decisions, if your decisions are predetermined by brain
*  activity, you can never predict what you will do and nobody can.
*  So even if you record all the neurons in your brain, you cannot predict what the person
*  will do. And this is because of chaos theory, because it's impossible.
*  A complex system like the brain is unpredictable.
*  So, OK, what I'm doing is not, I mean, coming out of some material mind, the
*  silencing is predetermined.
*  But since nobody can guess what I will do in principle, I mean, well, who cares?
*  Including yourself. It works.
*  Yeah. Including myself.
*  It's not a comforting solution.
*  Exactly. Yeah.
*  And that's why I say it's a double-edged blade, no, because it's nice to investigate
*  in that. But on the other hand, I mean, you're thinking, hmm, there's something that's
*  still like, I mean, there's something that I still like, I don't like.
*  And it gets worse when in the last chapter I discussed about immortality.
*  Yeah. And it's a very interesting philosophical and scientific problem.
*  And if you want to put it in one word, I mean, death is not maybe death is not a
*  metaphysical problem. It's more a biological problem these days.
*  And it's very interesting what determines death.
*  I mean, when can you say that somebody dies?
*  And it sounds like a trivial question, but it's not that trivial because 100 years ago,
*  I don't know, a few hundred years ago, they would say when the heart stopped, the person
*  is dead. Well, but today you can resuscitate somebody.
*  And so it's not dead. It's come back and it's the same person.
*  So what determines that you die?
*  And are you if somebody brings you back, are you still the same person?
*  So what is it in your body, in your brain, in whatever that determines that you're always
*  the same? And I think this is a fascinating question.
*  And I think as I discuss in the epilogue of the book, I think philosophy is changing.
*  And I say this in a very humble way because I'm not a philosopher, but kind of seeing
*  it from outside, I mean, I have the feeling like, well, it's changing.
*  It's really changing. I think we're living a revolution, more or less like the car
*  live a revolution at his time because some of the problems that were puzzling us
*  for centuries, I think they're not that hard to answer anymore.
*  But I think we're facing new problems and I think immortality and death and the
*  continuity of the cells and what determines our identity is the big, big challenge of
*  the 21st century. Whereas I think until recently, the big challenge was
*  consciousness. And I don't see this as a big puzzle anymore.
*  It is bustling. It's still not solved.
*  But I think the big question that is coming out now is identity.
*  Often, it seems that we're just not good at asking the right questions or that our
*  questions are formulated in a way that they're unanswerable.
*  And it seems like consciousness might fall under this classically, how we think of
*  consciousness. And I don't know about identity.
*  Maybe you have thoughts on that.
*  Yeah, I think you're right.
*  Sometimes when I ask myself a question as a physicist or as a scientist, the first
*  thing I will ask is, OK, let's try to formulate the question in a way that I may
*  approach it. And I'm very egocentric in this sense because I will try to think it in
*  a way that I can approach it myself in my experiment.
*  Sure. So sometimes a question, I may not find it that interesting if I'm not if it's
*  not related to my own stuff.
*  Why is that? I'm egocentric, but it's because I would like to think of things that I
*  could potentially address somehow with very specific experiments, I mean, doing
*  recordings in patients.
*  So I agree that sometimes we pose the question in a very vague way or general way that
*  are unanswerable.
*  And consciousness is one very good example.
*  And my boss, my former mentor, Christophe Koch, used to say this for four decades.
*  And he said, well, let's try to pin down the question and do experiments and start
*  answering it. And I think one big problem of consciousness is that we talk about it
*  without really defining what we mean by this.
*  And I'm not asking about a definition, but it's like, well, what do we mean with that?
*  I mean, let's not give a precise definition.
*  But and I have the feeling that if we start being more precise what we mean about
*  consciousness or qualia, it's not that hard to answer.
*  But vanishes. The problem vanishes.
*  The more precise you get, it seems like.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  And and there's some there's some very, very brutal insight that I read from Dan Dennett
*  in his in his fantastic book Consciousness Explained, like it's a classic from 20 years ago.
*  And basically, Dan Dennett said very, very clearly, let's not try to explain the
*  illusion of consciousness.
*  Let's try to explain actually the underpinnings of consciousness.
*  Let's try to explain the actual processes, process happening in the brain, but not the
*  subjective feeling we have about what we believe it happens.
*  It's kind of like the way I see it is I link it to memory and I link it to vision.
*  The classic example is vision.
*  If you think about vision, if you try to explain how can I see everything that is in
*  front of me right now?
*  Well, it's a hard problem.
*  But if you if you try to think about the actual neuroscientific process going on where
*  we're not seeing everything at the same time, what we can see in focus at a particular
*  time is a tiny bit of what is in front of that, which is maybe one, two degrees visual
*  angle. And then we move our eyes, but we don't move it the whole time.
*  We jump and we jump the eye position three times a second.
*  And from that, we carry the construct.
*  So let's not try to explain the construct of what we believe is in front of us.
*  Let's try to explain the physical process.
*  We see a tiny fraction there and then we extract information from that.
*  Now, from this information and how you process it, you can explain how later we can
*  create this construct of what we call vision, seeing.
*  And I think it's the same with consciousness.
*  So if I'm looking at you or if I'm hearing you and I have, I mean, with very bits of
*  information, I'm kind of like creating this feeling of being talking to you, talking to
*  to a person.
*  But I don't need to explain or I need to try to find neurons in charge of the whole
*  construct I create around this.
*  Let's say for memory.
*  I mean, we have the feeling of memory being like a movie that we play back.
*  I mean, we play back in time, but this doesn't exist.
*  We're making up those movies.
*  Yeah, exactly. We just remember very few facts that we link together, we associate
*  somehow and we construct a story around the facts.
*  So let's not try to explain the movie.
*  Let's try to explain that actually the facts and how we encode these facts and how we
*  can encode these associations.
*  And then we can I mean, we can construct a movie from that.
*  Since we're talking about identity and consciousness, I just want to bring it back to
*  concept cells and to touch on that again, because how might concept cells relate to
*  our sense of identity and consciousness, let's say, without defining it?
*  Yeah. So when you talk about consciousness, I like I like to again, I'm pinning it down
*  and I don't like these big definitions.
*  So I'm pinning it down into different things that we call consciousness.
*  It's very different to be aware of something that I see in front of me.
*  So imagine that I know you, imagine that we know each other for many years and I will
*  have many memories related to you.
*  So if I see you, if I'm seeing you in front of me now, there will be a first process
*  linked to consciousness, which is awareness, perceptual awareness.
*  I can recognize you. I know who you are.
*  And I can do this with my visual cortex, even without the hippocampus, without concept
*  cells. So I can recognize you.
*  HM could do that. And HM didn't have his hippocampus.
*  So HM could recognize people he knew from before.
*  So there's a process called perceptual awareness, which is basically recognizing people.
*  But now, since I do have my hippocampus and I do have my concept cells, and if I know
*  you from before, I'm not just recognizing you, I'm bringing memories related to you.
*  And the fact that I recognize you is somehow lightening up my conscious cells in
*  the hippocampus. And this is bringing together different memories and experiences that I
*  have had with you in the past, if I would have known you from before.
*  So then it's like, oh, no, this is not just Paul.
*  Yeah, this is Paul. I mean, I remember meeting him and having a beer with him and this
*  and that. So I start bringing all these memories, I start bringing together all these
*  emotions and so on. And I think this is mediated by concept cells.
*  Now, you put this thing into into context.
*  And I think this second level of consciousness is mediated by concept cells.
*  So it's like you said second level.
*  So it's a richer consciousness, richer experience.
*  I think this is qualia.
*  I think I think putting putting together these experiences and these emotions and all
*  this information related to a particular concept, you go to you go to qualia.
*  This brings the experience.
*  I mean, what is the experience of seeing you?
*  Well, it's just recognizing you plus getting activated.
*  All these things that are related to you in my brain.
*  And I think this is mediated by hippocampus.
*  And I will argue that it's mediated by concept cells.
*  So qualia requires more than one thing.
*  It requires associations between experiences or concepts.
*  Yeah. And I'm not saying that the only way to get qualia is through concept cells,
*  because maybe you get somebody with hippocampal lesion and may still have the feeling of
*  something and so on. But I will see qualia as associations, associations between experiences.
*  Now, what hippocampus does facilitates is to have associations between disparate things.
*  So episodic memories, for example, if I had a beer with you, I don't know, in California
*  three years ago. When I see you to bring this experience to memory, I do need my hippocampus
*  for that. But other things related that we can call qualia.
*  So, for example, to know that you have a postcard or are a scientist or this and that.
*  This could be semantic memories that are stored in cortex that are not mediated by concept cells.
*  But I think to get the full richness of everything is to have co-activations of different
*  brain areas of things that are related.
*  And I think concept cells have a big role in that.
*  Maybe not an exclusive role, but they do play a big role in that.
*  They're almost like the constraints by which these things can become associated.
*  I mean, do you see creativity playing a role being mediated by concept cells?
*  Yes. And this is because depends on what I mean.
*  Again, let's not get into the definition of what is creativity.
*  I mean, many different things. But I think one aspect of creativity is a key aspect of
*  creativity is to be able to make disparate associations which are meaningful.
*  And I like to give an example.
*  That's because I come from physics or gravity.
*  You mentioned gravity before.
*  And I think the genius of Newton, I mean, when I when I taught physics to students, I
*  mean, I will teach gravity and so on.
*  And then you have this big equation to come up with the exact formulation of this equation
*  was brilliant. And Newton did that.
*  So the formula, the formula of gravity attraction between two bodies, planets and so on.
*  But I think the brilliance of Newton was not that was to realize, as he did, that an
*  apple falling from the tree follows the same principle as the moon going around the
*  earth. And the moon goes around the earth and doesn't fall because it's in movement.
*  So it circles around the earth.
*  It's the earth is always like trying to catch it down.
*  But since the moon is moving, continues to orbit around the earth, whereas the apple
*  is static. And therefore, I mean, the moment it gets off the tree, it falls down.
*  And I think to be able to make an association between an apple, as the legend says, an
*  apple, an object, whatever, an earthy object and the moon is brilliant because there are
*  two things that you will not in principle link together, like the moon up there and an
*  apple here next to me in the tree.
*  You will not make a connection between that.
*  And in order to make this connection, you need concept representations because you
*  shouldn't be thinking of, oh, this is a red apple with two leaves, which is a little bit
*  big. And this is a moon in its zenith.
*  And I don't know, it looks a bit orangey.
*  You get rid of all the details.
*  So you really have to think of the abstract concept is an object here, which is an apple
*  happens to be an apple and an object there in the firmament.
*  And they both follow the same principle.
*  So I think to have concept, I mean, to summarize this big explanation, I think creativity
*  is to be able to make these very disparate associations.
*  And I think to do that, you need to get rid of salient details and to extract a concept.
*  And I think this is exactly what concept cells represent.
*  But you need to keep very key details.
*  You need to get rid of a ton of details, the ones that aren't meaningful to the
*  association. And I guess the key is keeping the correct details.
*  Yeah. Otherwise, artificial intelligence will be surpassing us right now.
*  So that's very hard. I mean, like our brain is amazing at extracting the important
*  information, the relevant information.
*  So how can you teach a computer what is important, what is relevant?
*  Well, this is a very hard problem.
*  And I think computers are fighting against billions of years of evolution.
*  Do you think A.I. is on the right track to toward general intelligence?
*  So there's something I love.
*  I mean, one of the things that I love about writing the book and that was a surprise.
*  I mean, a surprise that I got myself in when writing the first chapter.
*  The first chapter is 2001, one of the big, big movies.
*  Something that I mean, when I think about it, I find amazing.
*  Somebody can say, I mean, I can tell my kid that 2001 is a movie that just came out
*  and they won't notice it.
*  You make that point in the book. That's an interesting point.
*  2001 is 50 years old. It's over 50 years old.
*  Yeah. And I can tell my son, look at this movie, it's a science fiction that just
*  came out in Netflix and he won't notice.
*  I think that the only real giveaway is that it doesn't cut.
*  The scenes don't cut every three seconds.
*  No, it's not MTV culture.
*  It's like really it's more like Tarkovsky.
*  Very, very long scenes. Yeah.
*  So but it's also something very interesting.
*  So the filming is amazing.
*  The filming, it could be from yesterday and it's 50 years old.
*  But the way it treats the topic is also amazing.
*  It's very contemporary, it's very actual.
*  And if you really get into the details of the things that Hal 9000 does,
*  this supercomputer, that is very actual.
*  I mean, it could be written by somebody doing artificial intelligence today.
*  And what I learned that I didn't know at the time that is that the scientific
*  advisor of this movie was Marvin Minsky.
*  Yeah. I didn't know it.
*  And Marvin Minsky is like, yeah, was the big pope of, I mean,
*  has been the big pope of artificial intelligence from its infancy.
*  And then it's oh, that makes a lot of sense.
*  Now, I mean, this guy was behind all these crazy ideas of of 2001.
*  Yeah. Well, there was somebody that really knew about it.
*  He was a consultant. Right. I'm not sure.
*  You know, one of the I can't remember what character was named
*  as like an anagram of his name or something.
*  Victor K. Minsky.
*  He was one of the astronauts I were making.
*  Yeah. So Victor K. Minsky. Yeah.
*  I'm glad that you didn't pick X Machina, you know, or any of the
*  movies these days that play on our on romance, you know, and the bro dude
*  in his island lab and stuff.
*  So I was very pleased with your 2001 choice there.
*  Yeah. But I mean, I going back to your question about
*  about if artificial intelligence is going the right track.
*  So because of that, I mean, and I read and I was watching many interviews
*  of being scared, I was trying to get all the information about the interaction.
*  Actually, there were three key people interacting because Arthur Clark,
*  who was a science fiction writer, was quite involved in the in the script
*  of 2001 together with Kubrick.
*  And then the third person was Mary Minsky.
*  And they didn't meet that many times, but they made a few times, the three of them.
*  And and then I was reading more and more and more on what Minsky
*  thought about artificial intelligence at the time and what he thought
*  just before he died, like one or two years ago, a couple of years ago, I think.
*  I mean, I think he he just got it right.
*  And he got it right in the 80s when he wrote his big book.
*  And he got it right until the day he died.
*  And he was saying not me.
*  He was saying guys were going the wrong track.
*  I mean, artificial intelligence is still missing the point.
*  And the point is, we're still not tackling the big issue, which is general intelligence.
*  And we are still clueless how to get that.
*  And what he criticized to the advances of artificial intelligence is that now
*  it's so fancy with all these deep neural networks and so on.
*  And I'm not criticizing this because I think it's amazing science.
*  I mean, I love what they do.
*  But we're getting networks, we're getting systems that are very good
*  at solving specific problems.
*  The key challenge still out there, which is how you can get some artificial
*  algorithm to excel at something and then to transfer information to something
*  completely different.
*  And we still don't know how to do that.
*  And you can potentially do that if you train the algorithm with million examples.
*  For example, if you have a chess program to start playing, go Alpha Zero
*  and do both things. Yeah.
*  But the only way to do that is if you have some artificial intelligence
*  solving a task and now if you want to train this algorithm to do a different
*  task, well, you need to get serious examples.
*  And we don't work like that.
*  So if I'm facing a new situation in my life, I will not need to face
*  this situation again and again and again to know how to react.
*  I mean, I'm facing a new situation and I know what to do because I somehow
*  develop some common sense.
*  And this is what is still missing in artificial intelligence.
*  And I'm not it's not me saying that Minsky said that.
*  So what is missing is the ability to do inferences, to do analogies and to
*  develop common sense.
*  And this is what we're still very, very far to to know how to do it.
*  Well, Minsky, I mean, so back at the birth of AI, everyone essentially was
*  working on artificial general intelligence because that was the question.
*  And he lamented that there are just very few people who are actually working very
*  few labs that are intentionally working on general intelligence.
*  I don't know.
*  I think that's changing a little bit.
*  But but I think part of the problem is that our conception of what intelligence
*  is has changed and as we've understood more.
*  And I wonder if that has something to a reason why.
*  Well, more than intelligence, I mean, the key issue for me is general
*  intelligence. And actually, I saw a talk of one of the big neural networks guy,
*  Joshua Banshee.
*  And there was something very interesting that I really like was the guy was really
*  passing now on how to how to really practice how to achieve consciousness.
*  And again, I mean, there's something for me in artificial intelligence.
*  There are two key challenges that are still unsolved.
*  One is how to make a machine conscious and we are clueless.
*  I mean, we see this in science fiction, but it's still fiction because we have no
*  clue how to do that. And the second is general intelligence.
*  And I'm speculating in the book, well, maybe the two problems are somehow
*  related to each other.
*  Maybe the moment I don't know how.
*  But I think I have some ideas how you potentially can do it.
*  But I'm not an expert.
*  Maybe the moment you get general intelligence to a machine, you can have a
*  machine that develops your intelligence, maybe they become conscious.
*  Speaking of definitions, do we do we know what general intelligence is?
*  Do we have a good definition?
*  I would define general intelligence as the ability to do a task you had not
*  you have to be trained to do and with very little training.
*  So if you have a machine learning to play chess, that this machine can do
*  visual recognition, but without salient examples.
*  And you speculate in the book that and I think this is in the epilogue.
*  And by the way, I really did enjoy the book very much, but I think my
*  favorite parts are the epilogue and the acknowledgments.
*  Yeah, really?
*  Because you well, you bring a lot of this together in the epilogue and then
*  and then the acknowledgments, you talk about how writing the book has changed
*  the direction of your research.
*  Yeah. And that's what made me think, oh, this guy sounds happy.
*  But OK, so but you speculate in the book that when we create something that is
*  general and generally intelligent, has general intelligence, that that it will
*  be subjectively aware.
*  Maybe because let's talk about general intelligence.
*  So for me, in order to understand, I mean, I'm not just following some rules.
*  I mean, if this I do that, if that I do that.
*  So I have to have more like like a grasp of what I'm doing.
*  So I have to go beyond stimulus response associations.
*  I have to have a deeper understanding.
*  I have to extract the meaning of a task that I'm doing and why I extract the
*  meaning. I can potentially transfer this knowledge into another task.
*  Now, if I'm if I'm stick to a task, if I know whenever this, this, this and it
*  happen, I do that, I can be very good at doing that and I can be very fast and I
*  can excel at this. Whenever this and this happens is this phase.
*  Whenever this and this this feature come together, it's that phase.
*  But now, if if I get like this, if I'm able to extract the meaning, I'm not sure
*  how to do it. I mean, I think that's a big challenge.
*  And if I extract the meaning, well, I can potentially transfer this meaning to a
*  different task without much training.
*  Now, if I'm able to extract the meaning, well, what's the difference between having
*  a representation of this meaning and being aware of this meaning of the meaning of
*  this thing, whatever it is.
*  Now, if you don't have this meaning representation, meaning in quotation mark
*  representation, this high level after representation of the meaning of something,
*  maybe you're not aware because A, B and C happens, you do one.
*  C, D and F happens, you do two and so on.
*  So it's always stimulus response, stimulus response.
*  And you don't even think about what you're doing.
*  You just do it mechanically.
*  But the moment you extract the meaning, well, you are aware of something.
*  And then maybe this awareness is not that far from consciousness and this awareness,
*  this meaning representation, which I don't know how to extract, but imagine you can.
*  Well, that's what you need for general intelligence.
*  So in this sense, I think these two problems, which are the big, I think the
*  million dollar question, the two million dollar questions of AI, I think they
*  might be related.
*  And you think that analogy is one of the factors that ties them together as well.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  What, just, you know, getting back to the book, what was one of the chapters or
*  subjects that you found most challenging to write about?
*  Well, I tell you, I tell you a secret that I never saw on the record.
*  I mean, I told a few friends off the record, but I think I can say no because I did it.
*  My previous book was called The Forgetting Machine and it was supposed to be 10
*  chapters and it ended up in nine because I had to stop.
*  I couldn't, I couldn't write the 10th chapter because it was killing me.
*  It was, it was too hard.
*  And it was talking about death and I couldn't take it.
*  I had to stop.
*  And this time I said, well, I go for it.
*  I mean, I'll do it.
*  I really, it was too personal to you or it was just mentally challenging to.
*  It's not too personal, but I think, I mean, that's very deep.
*  And I got to tell you about my own experience.
*  I cannot talk for other people, but that's what happens to me.
*  And maybe some people will say, well, actually I feel the same.
*  My feeling is that sometimes we tend to deny that because it's too hard.
*  I mean, it's too hard to realize that you will die.
*  Yeah.
*  It's too hard to face that.
*  However, if you're able to face that, I think you come up much stronger
*  because you say I'm happy.
*  Why I'm happy?
*  Well, because I know that I'm dying and I don't want to waste the years I have
*  left doing something I'm not enjoying.
*  So being aware of my death, making me live my life fully.
*  I'm being a happy person.
*  If I deny that, if I'm not aware of my age, and if I'm not aware that in maybe
*  20, 30 years, that will be it for me.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  Maybe I will spend my whole time doing something that I really don't care much,
*  but I just do it out of inertia.
*  But the fact that I know that I'm aware that I can die tomorrow makes me do
*  things that I really enjoy.
*  So on the one hand, it's not fun to be thinking or to be aware that you die.
*  But on the other hand, this pushes you or it's kind of like being aware of your
*  death makes everything very clear.
*  Sometimes if you think, well, do I really want to do that or not?
*  Well, saying, well, fuck it.
*  I mean, if I'm dying next week, will I be doing that?
*  And if the answer is yes, then you should definitely do it.
*  Don't care about, don't worry about the rest.
*  Don't worry if you should be doing that, if what your colleagues will say, or
*  don't worry about that, just do it.
*  And that was hard.
*  And I think when I wrote the previous book, I wasn't prepared to face that.
*  And I think it took me a few years of digesting that to be able to have it
*  explicit in a final chapter.
*  So I think that that was hard.
*  It was hard to write it, but I think I was more prepared.
*  I couldn't do it in my previous book.
*  So I could do it now and I could somehow face the issue, but also face a
*  philosophical problem because now that I'm okay with my death somehow, I mean,
*  it still hurts.
*  It's still not easy to talk about that.
*  It's still not easy to think about that, but I can face it as a talkable
*  scientific and philosophical problem.
*  And it's extremely interesting and it's related to the problem of identity,
*  which I think is the big puzzle of the 21st century.
*  That's one of the, this is the concluding chapter in the book and you tie it into
*  the movie, Abre Los Ojos, right?
*  Or Open Your Eyes or the American version of The New Sky, which is not
*  nearly as good.
*  Yeah.
*  You tie the idea.
*  The question is, what's the evolutionary benefit of having a construct of self?
*  And you speculate that it's to ask about our future and to face death or in other
*  words, to fear of death, to fear of death.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm afraid I don't want to die.
*  The fact that I don't want to die.
*  I mean, I will do what I can to survive.
*  And I think this gives you an evolutionary advantage compared to somebody that
*  doesn't have this fear.
*  I mean, maybe, I don't know, I could take drugs and kill myself.
*  I mean, who cares if I die?
*  Well, no, I won't do that because I don't want to die.
*  I don't want to kill myself.
*  I don't want to end up post-traited or something.
*  I mean, I'm afraid of that.
*  So I think this contract of the self gives you a fear of death, which is an
*  evolutionary advantage.
*  It's crazy how much I personally think about dying, how often it comes across
*  in my head.
*  It's, I mean, I think that half of our function of brain is to, is to convince
*  us of the illusion that we're all immortal.
*  Right.
*  So we don't think about death all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's not, it's a compromise though, because I'm not every day
*  thinking about this.
*  I mean, it's not that I wake up and say, Oh, I will die.
*  I will die.
*  But, but it's good to have it.
*  I see, I see the image and I managed to put this image in the book, which, I
*  mean, which is this amazing picture from the seven seals, the movie of Bergman,
*  where this night coming from the crusades is playing chess with death and facing
*  death and trying to win the game.
*  And this guy know that it's impossible to be dead, but it's this image of, of
*  a person facing that I found it amazing.
*  I love it.
*  And I, I was so lucky.
*  I mean, I was so happy when I, when I learned that I could really put the
*  image in the book, because I think this image summarizes a lot.
*  It's not that, I mean, you have to be thinking of death the whole time, but
*  it's good to be aware of it because this really, really clarifies a lot of, of
*  uncertainties and a lot of questions that other, I mean, somehow it gets
*  cloudy and fuzzy in your mind.
*  But when you are aware of these, I mean, I think many, many decisions
*  be, are, are, get very clear.
*  I mean, you have kids, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So you know very well that the idea of not existing actually is comforting sometimes.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  No, for me, no way.
*  I mean, if I have to choose, I would prefer things to be different, but, but
*  life is life.
*  I mean, that's, that's the way it is.
*  Yeah.
*  I've, I've come to the realization not to harp on death, but it's really just
*  the pain of, and the experience of dying.
*  It's not death.
*  It's not not existing that, that I'm afraid of.
*  It's like, Oh, it's going to hurt.
*  You know, it's going to be really unpleasant.
*  That's what I'm afraid of.
*  No, but also the non-existing part for me is hard because I mean, I, I, I
*  would like to have, I would like to think that I will meet people that are not
*  here anymore and I would like to see that I'd be there for the ones I love
*  when I'm not here anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  So it is more comfortable, more comforting to think that there's something else.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you think is one of the most damaging?
*  Um, so in the book you write about a lot of historical ideas and, uh, research.
*  What do you think is still with us today?
*  That's one of the most damaging and influential historical ideas about,
*  about brains or our minds or intelligence.
*  Yeah.
*  So we'll tell you something that is extremely controversial, extremely
*  controversial that, I mean, I have a neuroscience, a lot of people that I
*  really admire that I read and that I really enjoy discussing with them, but I
*  think they, okay, I said it straight, um, because it's very controversial and I
*  don't want to be arrogant.
*  I don't want to, I mean, sound, Oh, I know more than these guys because this
*  guy know a hell lot more than me.
*  But I think we have an inherent bias in neuroscience that we believe that the
*  human brain is just a rat brain scale or a monkey brain scale, and we're thinking
*  of the processes of the human brain as what we found in animals brain, but just
*  a little bit more complex or a little bit more evolved.
*  And if you think about it, it cannot be.
*  And that's because let's compare a human to a chimpanzee.
*  I just say, Oh, come on, a chimpanzee, come on.
*  The brain of the chimpanzee, just one set of a human brain.
*  It's not just, I mean, our brain is not like a million times larger than a
*  chimpanzee. It's just three times larger.
*  And actually, OK, I mean, it has a larger set of animals, but an elephant has a
*  bigger brain than us and a whale has more neurons than us.
*  So then you start thinking, well, why, why, why if our brain is three times
*  larger, we're so much more intelligent.
*  And I don't mean to say that chimpanzees are not intelligent.
*  Of course, they are very, very intelligent.
*  They can do amazing things, tons of things, but nothing compared to human.
*  So why is it? And then like then I see that somehow we have a bias to think.
*  I mean, and sorry.
*  And when when we say monkeys, we don't mean a chimpanzee.
*  We mean a macaque monkey, which is a species that we study in the lab,
*  which is actually the brain of a monkey is three times smaller than a chimpanzee
*  brain. So compared to a human brain, the macaque brain is nothing.
*  I mean, and don't worry about the mouse brain or a rat brain.
*  So I think it is true that there are many processes,
*  basic processes that they go all across species action, potential,
*  is very action potential and connection between neurons.
*  And there are many, many, many plasticity.
*  I mean, consolidation, reconsolidation.
*  I mean, even if you stick to memory, there are many things that are called
*  visual perception. There are many principles that hold.
*  But from there to think that.
*  Human memory or human intelligence is just an upscale version of what we see
*  in rats or macaque monkeys.
*  It cannot work. And the reason it cannot work is because if you take the brain
*  of a chimpanzee and you compare it to the brain of a human, it's just three times
*  larger. So there has to be something that is radically different.
*  I mean, you like artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence.
*  Imagine that you build up a network to do something and then you build up a
*  network that is three times larger.
*  Would you expect the difference to be as the one you find between a chimpanzee
*  and a human? No, unless the big network was trained in a completely different way
*  and has a completely different way of working.
*  And I think that's the key. I mean, there has to be something that is radically
*  different between what our neurons do and what the chimpanzee neurons do,
*  how we encode information and how chimpanzees encode information.
*  And I will argue now and now I'm a bit egocentric because I will talk about my
*  own stuff. I will argue that maybe these concept cells have something to do with
*  that because concept cells encode information in a completely different way
*  compared to place cells in rats.
*  And we say that at the beginning of our chat that, yeah, place cells can be also
*  seen as concept, but they encode information in a completely different way.
*  And if I can say it very quickly, the difference is that place cells are
*  context dependent. If you change the context a little bit, place cells will remap.
*  They will change the way they fire.
*  Whereas in humans, if you change the context, then you do more or less the same.
*  Then Jennifer Aniston will fire to Jennifer Aniston no matter what.
*  If she's here, if she's there and so on.
*  So and I think this context independent representation gives you somehow a tool
*  to have a higher level thinking, a higher level construct, higher degree.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Of abstraction. So I think a damaging idea.
*  I mean, it's too harsh to say damaging idea because it's not damaging.
*  But I think instead of saying damaging idea, because it would be unfair to the
*  people, my heroes in neuroscience, it will be really unfair.
*  I will say somehow reading the books and learning from these big guys.
*  We tend to develop unconsciously a bias of trying to find or trying to think that
*  the human brain works in the same way as a monkey brain.
*  But we have to be aware that there had to be many things that are just
*  radically, radically different.
*  Otherwise, it cannot be.
*  Do you think of, you know, with your physics background, is it fair to think of
*  the qualitative difference?
*  So so there's quantitative, right?
*  We have a bigger brain and then there's qualitative.
*  It's our brains are doing different things.
*  You know, let's say you add add the concept cells and, you know, somehow the
*  concept cells come online and we can abstract things.
*  Is it fair to think of that as sort of a phase change or a what I want to say, an
*  emergent phenomenon that allows a different kind of processing on top of
*  essentially the same hardware?
*  I think so.
*  Let's be very precise.
*  So I hope people, I mean, some of your people hearing that may work on
*  artificial intelligence.
*  I really hope somebody will one day pay attention to this idea.
*  It may be a useless idea, but it may be interesting.
*  It makes sense because if you have neurons in the rat brain that whenever you
*  change the context, they will fire differently.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know that a rat, I mean, a rat, you train the rat in one environment and
*  then you put it in the recording rig and you want to start doing recordings and
*  the rat is completely lost.
*  And you say, come on, I'm asking you to do the same.
*  It's the same task you have been doing for months.
*  You learn to do the task.
*  And now I just put you in the recording rig and you cannot do it well because
*  you change the surrounding and the rat doesn't understand what, what, what she
*  has to do now.
*  But back to general intelligence, know the ability to transfer information.
*  It's very hard to transfer information is if the coding of information is
*  attached to a particular context, because the moment you change the context, you
*  are, you are at chance level again, you have to restart from scratch.
*  And this is what happens without artificial intelligence.
*  You want some AI to do a completely different task.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Maybe you can train the AI to do that, but you have to train and train and train
*  and train.
*  Now, if you will have context independent information, then basically the rat
*  will say, well, I'm actually doing the same task.
*  So if I'm doing it here, if I'm doing it there, it's the same thing.
*  So I keep doing it.
*  So I think this ability to have a context independent information, as we do find
*  in the human brain in contrast to what is found in animals, maybe a key component.
*  I mean, or a query requirement for, for general intelligence, but that's
*  just plain speculation.
*  So I hope somebody do a modeling AI and so may pick up this idea one day and say,
*  Oh, actually maybe we can try to implement something like that and see what,
*  what happens.
*  Well, I know that we're getting close here to time and I actually want to
*  write about, I want to ask about your writing process because you've written a
*  lot and were you, were you, have you always been a writer?
*  I know I, I, I, I love writing since I'm a teenager.
*  I kind of like, I don't know, I'm a frustrated writer.
*  I did science because I couldn't write another.
*  I know I, I like missing both things.
*  I mean, what I like about writing is that I feel not constrained.
*  Sometimes science can be constrained because I can only discuss facts that I
*  can prove.
*  I mean, I, when I write the paper, I don't want to be over overly speculative
*  because it's, it's hand waving.
*  Two lines in a discussion that you can speculate a little bit, right?
*  Yeah, but I don't like doing that much.
*  I mean, if I speculate my speculations in science, when I write an article,
*  they're based on facts.
*  We found these neurons and this means this, this and that.
*  So for example, we do, I'm speculating about how concept cells could be the
*  basics of human intelligence, but I'm not just hand waving.
*  I mean, this is based on facts.
*  It's based on the fact that these are context independent abstract neurons
*  and in rats they're not.
*  And this may not be a conscience, but when I write, when I write the book,
*  I just let loose.
*  I mean, I'm not constrained by the custom fact.
*  I can just speculate.
*  Oh, well, what if, what if this, what if that, what if that, and maybe this is
*  something that cannot be possible now.
*  Anyway, I like to think about that.
*  And I like to write about that.
*  It's a release, isn't it?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, but it also informs your, uh, research, right?
*  Because then you can make these disparate, otherwise disparate ideas come together
*  and it informs how you move ahead with your research perhaps.
*  Yeah.
*  For example, I mean, you're, you're reading the acknowledgements that writing
*  this book changed my career.
*  That's an underlying question that is all over the book, which is basically
*  what makes us human if you want to put it like in one sentence, what is it?
*  What makes me different from Hal 9000 from a supercomputer?
*  And what's making me different from other animals?
*  What is it?
*  What is it in our brain that makes that?
*  At the time I wrote the book was kind of like my hand waving.
*  I mean, my speculative question, I have no clue.
*  I mean, but I like to speculate about that.
*  And the fact that I can write a book, I can be speculative.
*  I can think about planet of the apes.
*  I can think about 2001.
*  I can think about, I don't know, Terminator and so on.
*  But after playing around with the idea right now, I'm doing experiments,
*  trying to prove the point.
*  So what, what for me was speculating like freely speculating in a book.
*  Now it's actually the basis of my research.
*  This is the hypothesis that I want to prove with my experiment.
*  That's beautiful.
*  So I like playing, I like playing like being in between, like in the border
*  between, between fiction and science.
*  If you had to start your research career over, what would you be doing?
*  Would you be doing AI or how would you go about your trajectory?
*  I don't know.
*  I, it just came this way because if.
*  Does it matter where you start?
*  I guess it does.
*  I mean, but, um, you know, there's something that happens a lot.
*  I think, you know, not, I mean, in life, it's like, you asked me, so why, why,
*  why do you live in Leicester?
*  Why, why are you in the city in the middle of England?
*  Why are not, and I don't know, in Cambridge or in Oxford, he said, well,
*  actually it's destiny.
*  I didn't make a conscious choice.
*  This happened somehow.
*  And then I convinced myself there was a good reason for that.
*  And we tend to that, to do that a lot.
*  We train to rationalize our decisions that are somehow unconscious.
*  And we're actually, because there's no free will, we know that already.
*  So, so back to our issue.
*  So I don't know.
*  I mean, my career has, I mean, what I didn't regret was changing
*  because I changed a lot.
*  And that was at the time you could have seen, well, that was suicide.
*  When, when I was doing physics, I was doing well.
*  I mean, I was working with a very, very good physicist.
*  I mean, when I was doing dynamical systems, somebody that I really admire
*  were publishing good papers.
*  But then I really wanted to change.
*  And I started neuroscience from scratch.
*  We hardly know what a new one was, but it was a good decision because
*  that's exactly what I wanted to do.
*  And so although I may have taken wrong decisions, but I have done things
*  that is, oh, maybe it would have been, I would have been a better neuroscientist
*  now if I wouldn't have spent so much time doing math and physics.
*  But on the other hand, doing math and physics got me into developing a method
*  for analyzing data that lead me to discovering these cells that
*  nobody else could see before.
*  So it's hard to say.
*  Yeah.
*  No, no one has a, yeah, everyone, everyone has an interesting and different path.
*  And I don't know.
*  I just don't know that there's a good way to aim even.
*  You, it's besides just moving forward.
*  That's like all you can do almost.
*  I mean, the only thing, I mean, that's back to this issue of the,
*  being aware of your death.
*  I think the key question at any point in time is I, am I doing what I really want
*  to do?
*  And as long as the answer is yes, it's fine.
*  I mean, I could be doing cosmology and if I really enjoy doing cosmology, well,
*  why not?
*  I mean, there's a difference.
*  So, you know, the advice used to be to follow your passion and you hear that a
*  lot these days too, was figure out what your passion is and then follow that.
*  But the alternative advice that I think is actually more valid is you work through
*  something and you develop a passion through your work.
*  And so, you know, they're not separable.
*  I say more than being aware of your passion because I agree with you.
*  I'm passionate about what I do now.
*  I mean, I'm really passionate about trying to understand it.
*  Let me put it this way.
*  The neural correlates of unique human intelligence.
*  That's in one line, what I want to do now.
*  And I'm really passionate about that.
*  My baby, if I will have follow another path, I will be passionate to discover what's
*  the origin of the universe or whatever.
*  I think the key is to more than being aware of your passion because you can be
*  passionate about different things.
*  It's true that if you have a passion, you should, I mean, it's good to be aware of
*  that. It's also be aware of your strength because I recognize, I mean, or I
*  recognize at the time that I realized, well, maybe to do theoretical cosmology.
*  I don't know. I mean, there are guys that are much more clever for that than me.
*  And I kind of possibly, I mean, parallel disguise.
*  They I don't see me doing something that it will be useful to somebody in a field
*  that, I mean, it's not my stuff.
*  I mean, I'm not that good at that compared to other guys.
*  So I think it's very good to be aware of your strengths to then to exploit them to
*  the maximum.
*  What's a setback or a failure that you've experienced that and how did you move on
*  from it?
*  I mean, there are many things I mean, but I don't have big failures because I have
*  a very I don't think I have much of an ego.
*  I mean, I said that I'm very egocentric in the fact that I do whatever I care
*  about and I don't care about the other people.
*  But I don't have an ego that if you come tomorrow and say, well, actually, what
*  you say about artificial intelligence is wrong because this is and that I will be
*  upset, but I will listen to you and then tomorrow say, actually, he's right.
*  Cool.
*  And I will adapt.
*  So my my thinking, for example, of concept cells are not the same now compared to
*  when I discovered them.
*  It has evolved.
*  Talk about that because you didn't really know what you had when you found it.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, when I found it, it's like crazy.
*  Suddenly I got my first nature paper.
*  It got all over the media and people are talking about this and nobody had a clue
*  what this means. And people were misled into this discussion about grandmother cells,
*  which I really hated.
*  But then talking to people and hearing different opinions, I mean, then my my view
*  of what these neurons do and what it means to have this neuron has evolved, has
*  really changed a lot.
*  I mean, from the moment I discovered them till today, I maybe will evolve further.
*  Maybe what I'm thinking now, how these neurons are involved in human intelligence
*  will change.
*  So I think an attribute of a good scientist, maybe if I have something that I
*  mean, I think is good, is that I'm I'm not stuck with an opinion.
*  So if somebody shows me wrong, I don't have a problem with taking taking this
*  information. Actually, I was wrong.
*  So therefore, I didn't have any major upsets because I was not holding tight to
*  an opinion and trying to defend it no matter what for ages.
*  I was very malleable.
*  I was very flexible.
*  Now, this has evolved and it's very hard now for me for somebody to change my
*  opinion because I heard a lot of opinions and I think it's converging.
*  And yet so I cannot name a major thing now in the daily in the daily practice.
*  I do have major upsets, which is, for example, getting a grant rejected.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Comes again and again or a high profile paper rejected.
*  And I think the recipe of a good scientist is that you just keep trying.
*  You have to be resilient.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's really upsetting and you want to quit and you don't want I'm never
*  writing a grant anymore.
*  I'm never sending a paper to this journal ever again.
*  And this and that.
*  But then next day, say, OK, I go for it.
*  Yeah, you have to start over again.
*  We all do the same.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  What is something that you've done that you consider a complete waste of your
*  time?
*  Anything?
*  Oh, I don't know if.
*  Well, I can I can give you an example.
*  For example, when I when I was finishing physics, I mean, you have to do a final
*  year project, which usually last one year in Argentina where I studied physics
*  and mine lasted two years because I really couldn't find the result.
*  And and that was because I was trying to replicate somebody else's result.
*  And I met this person much later.
*  I won't name the person or the results.
*  And then she confessed that it was all fake.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And I was like and I was like, gosh, that was two years of my life.
*  But I don't regret it because trying to follow something that was wrong
*  got me into studying the brain.
*  Yeah, because I was I was trying to find out.
*  I mean, I was in chaos theory, a physicist, and I was trying to find out if the brain
*  was a chaotic system, as other people claim.
*  And I wasted my time.
*  And actually, I discovered much later that the question even was that interesting
*  after all, but I wasted my time.
*  I wasted two years, but I learned about chaos tools that I couldn't use in other
*  contexts and so on.
*  Yeah.
*  And that got me into slowly got me to study something that I end up being
*  interested about.
*  So, yeah.
*  What is something that you feel guilty about not paying more attention to?
*  You know, you should be paying more attention to something that paper on your
*  desk that you always look at and then.
*  No, no, it won't be a paper.
*  No, it will be a book, maybe.
*  So, for example, when I wrote my first book called Borges and Memory, I wrote a lot
*  about this writer that I mentioned before.
*  You love Borges.
*  Is it Borges?
*  Yeah, Borges.
*  Yeah, I used to read it as a teenager.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's a very famous writer in my country and I love his stories.
*  And to be able to link my research to Borges was like, wow, that's amazing.
*  But reading Borges, I was very interested to get to understand how he came up with
*  these brilliant ideas, not being a scientist.
*  So here, these ideas that nouns are abstractions and that without nouns, you
*  won't be able to think that that's fabulous.
*  I said, how, how, how did I come up with this idea?
*  And I'm I, I tried to follow his readings.
*  So I had access.
*  I mean, I met his widow and she allowed me to see his books in his library.
*  So I was checking what he was reading and I tried to more or less read what he
*  was reading related to the mind with potential marks or the brain and so on.
*  And then I realized, oh, I mean, there's a lot there from 19th century.
*  Maybe, I mean, there's a lot to learn from these guys that wrote about that
*  ages ago, there's a lot to learn about the brain from all philosophers and so on.
*  So I felt guilty at the time of not having read, I mean, being always aware of
*  the latest paper published in our field, but not being aware of what Aristotle
*  said about that 2000 years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And, or what, or what the writer has to say about that.
*  And, and they come from a completely different angle.
*  And I think it's, it's very rewarding to broaden.
*  I mean, somehow our, our readings, I think we get a much, much bigger picture of
*  what we are doing when we start reading a bit more philosophy or literature
*  and these types of things.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a rabbit hole to go down though too.
*  So that's why it never ends.
*  Yeah.
*  Never, never ends.
*  And that's, that's why I appreciate the way that you bring it up consistently
*  through the book is, and just keep touching on it.
*  And so we don't have to go just down that road because you're always bringing it up
*  in the context of, of either a movie or mostly the modern science, which is,
*  which is great.
*  If I had, if you had to, if I pinned you down, I'm going to make a scale
*  and from one to a hundred and one is the McCulloch-Pitts neuron, artificial
*  neuron. So let's say like the very earliest artificial intelligence work.
*  And 100 is general intelligence.
*  Where would you say we are with deep learning?
*  It's hard to put it in a scale because you, you're putting a goal that maybe
*  it's not necessarily the goal of deep learning because I think somebody could
*  say, look, I mean, I don't care about the brain and I don't care about general
*  intelligence. I mean, I can have a deep learning network that can recognize
*  faces better than a human. I can translate better than a translator or can
*  recognize like handwriting or audio or whatever. And fair enough.
*  I mean, and that's fine. I mean, I don't see why this is, this is wrong.
*  Now, if you want to use deep learning to understand the brain,
*  the human brain or the monkey brain or whatever, that's a different question.
*  Deep learning can be very interesting on its own without addressing this question.
*  I think I have the feeling that the wave is changing, that we have this big
*  boost of deep learning after Hinton's paper seven, eight years ago.
*  But I think now this, this big flash of beating somebody at Go or playing this
*  Atari game is slowly decaying and the big questions are coming back.
*  And that's back to Minsky. The big question of general intelligence is
*  coming back. And I was very pleased to see Joshua Bungio talking about
*  consciousness and also mentioning a bit about artificial intelligence.
*  So I think if the field gets there, who knows? I mean, maybe we'll have super
*  revolution. I mean, maybe we are, I don't know, I'm just making up numbers.
*  Maybe we're 20 right now, but next year we'll be 80. Maybe we'll take decades.
*  Who knows? Maybe we'll never get there. But I think the key point is that we get
*  interested in that. Do you think that a deep learning network
*  is closer to a McCulloch-Pitts neuron or the brain?
*  I mean, my naive version of deep learning, and this might be one of the naive
*  conceptions I have, then maybe one year I will say, you talk to me again and say,
*  well, actually what I told you, I was too naive and I was wrong.
*  But a naive feeling I have about deep learning is that as the word says,
*  you have many, many layers. So it's deep because you have many layers.
*  And my naive feeling, my gut feeling is that you have salient parameters to fit.
*  So this can lead to, if you allow me to use the term, I mean, vaguely overfitting.
*  So basically you get your network to be very, very good at doing a very precise task.
*  But the moment you want the network to do another task is hard because you fit all
*  these variables, all these strengths of the salient layers or whatever, not salient layers,
*  but the salient nodes in these many, many layers, you fit them very precisely to excel
*  at some particular task. And the fact that you, again, allow me to use the word, you
*  overfitted the network for solving this task may go against the general intelligence task,
*  which is the opposite. I mean, you don't want to be that, that good at some task.
*  Right. You want it to be good at the task,
*  but to also be able to transfer information. I may be overfitting, it's not the answer,
*  but I don't know. Maybe I'm too naive in making such a simplistic conclusion.
*  Finally, Rodrigo, you are known as the Jennifer Aniston neuron guy or the concept cell guy.
*  What do you want your legacy to be? Do you want to be known as that? Do you want to be known as a
*  writer or is there something else? Well, the honest answer is back to this issue of the last
*  chapter of the book, which is being aware of that. The honest answer is I don't care. I mean,
*  or if you want to put it, I mean, if you want me to play with your question, somebody that did,
*  like a happy person, as you say, somebody that did whatever or who enjoyed his career. If I get
*  20 Nobel prizes for that, if I don't have to publish a good paper for that, who will take
*  the fun out of it from me? If I'm doing something that I don't like and you give me a huge reward
*  in 10 years time, I don't think it's worth it because you get a prize, you get something and
*  is it really that important? I mean, yeah, you do get the prize. Everybody claps and then,
*  but now if you give me a career that I'm enjoying going to the lab and doing what I
*  do because I'm really liking it, I think that's the best. I think that's, that's unbeatable,
*  irrespective of what my legacy will be. I think the legacy will be, well, somebody that
*  really enjoyed what he was doing. That's great. Well, I, again, I just, I really enjoyed the book.
*  You write really well. It's just a joy to read. I was skeptical at first because you,
*  because I'm not a big movie guy. I think sci-fi movies are generally, I don't think I enjoy them
*  nearly as much as you do. I'm a much more critical critic, I think, of movies, but you do it really
*  well in the book. And so I appreciate you writing the book and having read it. So, thanks.
*  Thank you very much. I really enjoyed talking to you. It was great.
