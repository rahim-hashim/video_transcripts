# BI 104 John Kounios and David Rosen: Creativity, Expertise, Insight
**Brain Inspired:** [May 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF-6qoE224c)
*  What does it feel like for the person? Are there any psychological constructs that exist
*  out there that would really encompass what this feels like when people are being created?
*  What's the closest thing?
*  You know, when you have an insight, it pops into awareness in a way that's seemingly
*  disconnected from the ongoing stream of thought because the brain had been working on that
*  at some kind of unconscious level.
*  Novices, when asked to be creative, they performed better, and the experts, it hindered their
*  performance. Expertise may ultimately affect the types of cognitive processes and the way
*  that we approach a creative task.
*  One way to think of insight, it's a way to leapfrog across complexity. If that's what
*  insight is, it behooves us to figure out what the computational mechanism is and see
*  if we can implement it in an artificially intelligent system.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hey, it's Paul. Just like you, I have been told that I'm creative. Yes, by my mother,
*  a long, long time ago, but also by a few other people along the way. And whenever that happens,
*  I take it as one of the highest compliments that I could receive. There's a little problem
*  Like intelligence, I don't really understand what creativity means. I think I know it when
*  I see it, but I also know that different people are creative in different ways. There seem
*  to be different modes of creativity and so on. So we have a bunch of questions. How does
*  creativity come about? How do our brains implement creativity? Are there a few underlying principles
*  that would help us create creative machines?
*  Those are the kinds of questions that we discussed today with John Kunios and David Rosen. So
*  John runs his Creativity Research Lab at Drexel, where they study these kinds of questions.
*  He's also written a popular science book about creativity and about insight specifically.
*  That's called The Eureka Factor, Aha Moments, Creative Insights, and The Brain. And David
*  was a graduate student in John's lab, and he has gone on to form the company Secret
*  Chord Laboratories, where their work overlaps with the study of creativity, although they're
*  focused on what exactly in music makes us enjoy it and what that means for how music
*  evolves over time.
*  On the episode, we cover all of this basically. We talk about the current state of the study
*  of creativity and how we got to this point. We talk about conscious versus unconscious
*  processes related to creativity and insight. John and David have published a series of
*  studies together which uses jazz improvisation as a way to study creativity. In particular,
*  we talk about comparing the performance and the brain activity between experts and novice
*  jazz musicians while they improvise. And it turns out that the way that you're creative
*  and the brain circuits employed when you're creative depend on your level of expertise.
*  And there's a dual process model that helps explain what's going on there. So these are
*  the early days in the neuroscience of creativity, but we're beginning to open that door, or
*  at least John and David are. And we end up speculating a bit about what it might take
*  to build creative machines.

*  Thanks for listening. If you like the podcast, don't keep it to yourself. Tell a friend.
*  Here are John and David. Enjoy.
*  I'm not sure if I completely agree with that, but I think there's important aspects for
*  both the performer to think about and the audience, and also I think the interaction
*  that happens there. So I mean, like anything, music, jazz, or really any performing art,
*  or anytime you're speaking to anyone, it's really important to understand the audience.
*  And so the composition of that audience, there are many people who go to the jazz clubs regularly
*  and have a deep understanding of what's happening during the show. And that can be in a number of
*  different forms. It can be from an audience recognizing a classic lick from a standard
*  that's been played for 50 plus years, or it could be noticing that a certain player in
*  the ensemble is doing something that's new or surprising, or it could be just noticing,
*  as if I'm an audience member, the interactions that are happening live between the members on
*  stage that seem to be having at points, and sometimes like inside jokes between one another.
*  I think that might be kind of the more colloquial kind of idea of most music listeners when you
*  hear jazz. It's like, that really sounds different, and I don't really get what's happening. And I
*  think like any kind of specific niche, it's about having that deep knowledge and conceptual
*  understanding of those inside jokes and to understand the phenomenon of what's going on.
*  On the improviser side, again, it's about context. So if you're playing to that small jazz crowd,
*  or if you're maybe you're at a more different type of audience that's more broad, for example,
*  that is in that crowd, you may have a different engagement by the way that people are watching
*  you. And the way that people respond is going to impact kind of in some ways the way you're playing.
*  And so as a musician, I'm not necessarily a very good jazz musician, but through rehearsals,
*  there's definitely that inside those inside jokes that are happening and that really the
*  interactions between each other is really where I like to come back to. It's like when you rehearse
*  something over and over, and maybe like something silly happens at band practice or like, and you
*  just like start riffing off this idea and it goes out into somewhere where you never even like kind
*  of thought it would. And then maybe someone like teases that idea during a song, and everyone looks
*  at each other and maybe the audience doesn't really have a grasp of what's happening there.
*  So I think there's a balance, like anything to have the deepest level of appreciation for
*  something. It's about having the context that takes it just beyond just kind of thinking it
*  as music more broadly or as a backdrop for kind of where you are that evening.
*  See, I John, what do you think? Because I think he was just describing appreciation and not
*  more a more visceral enjoyment as a listener. Right. So the reason why I was asking is because
*  I can go off on some jazz thing and I'm super engaged in it. Right. But the person listening
*  would be horrified because it's me playing. But even if it was like Charlie Parker or something,
*  might not get it. They don't feel like they get it as much. You might have to have that understanding
*  of the jazz, the sound or something. John, maybe you should play in.
*  Yeah. I think it varies across performers and across audiences a lot. So let me put aside
*  jazz from it and talk about what I know a little bit better, which is classical music. So, OK,
*  sure. Take the great pianist Glenn Gould. Right. He was a great concert pianist. And but he hated
*  performing for people. He hated going to performances. He just hate. He thought that
*  performances were blood sport. They were demeaning. So he quit at a young age. He quit the
*  concert circuit and just made recordings. And really, he was just doing what he wanted to do.
*  He was experimenting with music. He was playing music the way he liked to hear it. And I don't
*  think he really cared much what anyone else thought of it, except that, of course, he wanted to sell
*  records to support himself. So that's a certain type of performer. Other performers, they live
*  to please the audience. I can't hear you. How you feeling? Yeah. I mean, they the pleasure they get
*  is from the feedback from the audience. Glenn Gould didn't care about that feedback. He got the
*  pleasure from performing the way he wanted to hear it. So I think and I think in terms of going
*  to concerts or listening to music, whether it downloads or CDs or whatever, I think some people
*  are deeply, deeply into the music and other people do it. They get their rewards somewhere else.
*  Their rewards are being a part of the social community, jazz listeners or devotees of a
*  particular performer. So there are lots of reasons to perform. There are lots of reasons to listen.
*  And I think everybody gets their pleasure or their reward in a different way from a different place.
*  You just had to diffuse all the tension right there and make everyone happy.
*  Because we're going to be talking about expertise and its interaction with creativity today,
*  I've noticed and this is not just in music, but also in music, professional musicians,
*  when they're asked what their favorite piece is that they have created, it's almost never
*  their most popular work. They always say, and tied to that, it's also after they've
*  gone to rehab and gotten over the drugs, they say they're making their best music,
*  but not to the popular audience or to the critics ears. And I'm wondering if you have any
*  insight as to why that might be the first of all, if you agree with that, if I'm accurate in that
*  observation and secondly, why that might be the case that artists, I think painters alike and just
*  broadly artists, there's that phenomenon where they have a different idea of what their best work
*  might be. But it could be something as simple as what an artist thinks is their best
*  creation is something that pushes the boundaries of the genre and is harder for other people to
*  understand because of that. And things that are not genre pushing are not as popular because
*  there are fewer people that understand it. It could be something that simple. You mentioned
*  a very specific example of maybe a dark era where potentially drugs are involved and then
*  an individual makes it through those really trying times. And on the other side of that,
*  what they have found is a different level of personal happiness and feeling of a meaningfulness
*  of the music for them. And you're right. I think this goes back to in terms of how that's resonating
*  with the audience. To me, when you break down what makes really creative art important and powerful
*  is the ability to deliver a true emotional experience and feeling to other people that is
*  so deep and unique and to conjure that emotion. And so I think actually in that dark place,
*  it seems to be that there's this kind of relationship with creativity that especially
*  in music and in the arts, you're tapping into something that is dark and very authentic and
*  unique, kind of like strife of the artist. And when people seek creativity and seek art oftentimes,
*  they're looking for something that resonates with a piece of themselves that evokes something out
*  of them that maybe they couldn't get anywhere else. And maybe that artist isn't producing that
*  same kind of work on the other side of what we would call psychological well-being, I think.
*  And then the other piece was, I have a joke that with my friends, we're all making music all the
*  time and we say, what's the most creative piece or what's the best one? And it's always like the
*  track that we're working on yesterday. Of course. It's the newest track you make because it's for
*  the artist. I think it really is leaning into, I've done these steps to get here. Now the next
*  thing that I'm making is ultimately a coalescence of these creative pieces or tricks that I picked
*  up along the way and now I've landed here to making this thing. Do you think the same
*  occurs in science? I don't know about maybe our darkest moments.
*  But yeah, I think, well, let me step back for a moment. I think also in some cases,
*  a musician's, a composer's greatest composition is something they did a while, or most popular
*  composition is something they did a while back. So they're doing something now, which they think
*  is better, but other people like the things that came before. So the implication is you think I've
*  gone downhill? No, I haven't gone downhill. This is better than what I did before. So an example
*  would be Beethoven's Seventh Symphony was recognized universally as a great symphony. Then he wrote the
*  Eighth, which is shorter and it's arguably not as deep, but people thought it was fluff at the time.
*  And Beethoven said, no, the Eighth is much, much better than the Seventh. You don't understand it.
*  And he got very angry because I think at least in part because he didn't believe that he was
*  going downhill and he wasn't. His greatest compositions lay ahead of him at that time.
*  So I think it's some composers view that as almost an insult or as a, you know, oh, poor Beethoven,
*  he's sliding, he's slacking off, he's getting old and weird and that kind of thing. Now in terms of
*  science, the quality of the science is often more objective. Not always. I mean, there are certainly
*  scientific breakthroughs that are not truly understood for years to come. But if you did
*  an experiment and you got an outcome and it proved some point, it doesn't matter whether anybody thinks
*  it's beautiful or not as long as it's useful. Certainly people think it's beautiful. It will
*  become famous in the popular mind as well, or it's more likely to anyway. So I think science is a
*  little bit different in that sense. In music, there's no objective way to say one piece is
*  better than another. It's, you know, do people like it? Do people who know music like it? And do they
*  like it over a sustained period of time so that it has staying power? Whereas in science, you know,
*  that's less of an issue. All right, good. This kicks us off. We've already touched on multiple
*  things that we're going to talk about here. So I really went down the rabbit hole in preparation
*  for this interview, reading all about creativity and the neuroscience of creativity. You know,
*  not only your works that we're going to focus on here, but just sort of the history and boy,
*  so there are two things that I've kind of taken away from that. One, it seems a little bit like
*  the Wild West right now in the neuroscience of creativity. And maybe you can dispel me of
*  these notions, but you're laughing right now. So, but in one sense, that's a good thing. If that's
*  true, in one sense, that's a good thing because it means that there's a lot of work to do. In
*  another sense, you know, it's a bad thing because it means that there's potentially a low signal to
*  noise ratio in what counts, you know, as good science and how to figure all these things out.
*  The other thing that I recurringly thought, so we did an episode here recently on the show about
*  cognitive ontologies, like cognitive functions, like working memory. Is that a real thing? How
*  is it related to attention? How is it related to long-term memory? And like, where does it fit in
*  the structure of all of our cognitive functioning and creativity? It's a big word. It seems to ride
*  on top of other constructs. There are also very active areas of research in neuroscience and
*  cognitive science. And so I don't know what that means about studying it in the nitty gritty
*  neuroscience fashion that has been happening now for, you know, a decade plus. So I kind of wanted
*  to just put those thoughts out there and ask you broadly where we are, you think, in the science
*  and our understanding of creativity. Well, I have to jump in on that because when I was looking
*  through the list of potential questions that you sent, I made a few notes for them. And with regard
*  to that question, all I wrote in a note was Wild West. Wild West. Wild West. Exactly the phrase
*  you used. So yes, that's exactly. So here's the situation. Creativity research arguably began
*  scientific research on creativity in 1950 when Paul Guilford, who was already a famous psychologist
*  for his work on intelligence, turned to studying creativity. And he was elected the president of
*  the American Psychological Association. And he gave his inaugural address and he talked about
*  creativity. And that really was the beginning of I mean, there were people who dabbled before that,
*  but that's really kind of the beginning right there. It was like the mandate to say, OK,
*  let's do that. Yeah, it was a call to arms. And he didn't really have any data in that talk,
*  but he he described some ideas that would lead to studies. And then he got a grant from the Office
*  of Naval Research in the 1950s. And he started doing the research that he was describing.
*  And that really got things going. But the problem here's the problem. Creativity research,
*  the field, it's really started to take off in the last arguably 20 years or so with the addition
*  of a neuroscience approach. So you start with Guilford and his approach. He took the approach
*  he had used from intelligence research, looking at individual differences in creativity.
*  So you have individual differences. You have people studying, coming from a personality
*  research tradition. You have people coming from a social psychology tradition, people
*  coming from an economic perspective, looking at innovation. You have neuroscientists, you have
*  cognitive psychologists. It's a tower of Babel. They each have their own language. They have their
*  own ways of studying their own paradigms, both intellectual and experimental. They don't
*  necessarily agree on a definition of what creativity is. So it is very much a wild west.
*  Now that is good and bad. The bad part is that a lot of people are sort of talking across purposes.
*  They're not really communicating. And that makes it very difficult. On the other hand,
*  this is an exciting time in the field, because it's starting, it's just starting to gel.
*  It's starting to gel. And you brought up the field of memory research. Well, memory research
*  has been around since the 19th century. And a lot of the methods we use today are still
*  from the 19th century. There are newer methods, of course. But the study of memory is a mature
*  science. Everyone agrees on the concepts, the terms, the methods, et cetera. And it's kind of
*  a race to employ these methods quicker, better, to learn more. And I'm sure some
*  memory researchers will disagree with me, but it's sort of like in certain areas of biology where
*  everyone knows what the next step is. Who can get there next? Who can get there first
*  and uncover things? Who's got the biggest, best funded lab to get things done quickly? Whereas in
*  creativity research, it's the Wild West. There isn't much in the way of resources because it's
*  not a well-defined field yet, such that funding agencies and foundations have identified, say,
*  neuroscience and creativity as a field that they're going to pour resources into. So it's really
*  a matter of who's got the best ideas that will last the longest. And with the other bad ideas
*  dropping out as time goes by, people sort of coalescing around a particular way of looking
*  at it and a particular way of thinking about it. So yes, Wild West, absolutely. I'll add a little
*  bit to that. Not too much. That was really well said, John. So when I started graduate school,
*  I kind of had a vision. I had a vision of what I wanted to look into. I came kind of at it where
*  I had been improvising for years. I was very much into the music. And one of my first tasks,
*  the first day, the first year when I started in graduate school was literally to read all,
*  just do a deep, deep dive of all the different ways that we do try to define creativity through
*  different assessments. And what I saw in terms of standardized ways to try to understand how people
*  are creative are very different from one another in terms of even how we start to define it. So I
*  would break them up into two kind of categories. There's your classic along the lines of Guilford
*  and Torrance. There's your classic diversion thinking tasks, which basically ask people,
*  here's an object or come up or here's a problem. Come up with as many different solutions or ideas
*  as you can that you could, for instance, use a brick for or use a paperclip for. That's one.
*  Diversion thinking isn't necessarily creativity in itself, but it's one aspect of creativity.
*  It's coming up with a lot of different ideas. It's ideation. It's the generation of different
*  ideas that may seem very closely connected or may seem very disparate from the task at hand.
*  Then there's the other side of creativity assessments, which is along the lines of
*  convergent thought, which is a single solution. A lot of John's work on insight focuses on remote
*  associates tests, for example, where you come up with one solution that could combine one that I
*  like is where there's three words and then you try to find the word that would complete them all into
*  a compound word. The example we always use is crab, sauce and pine. Apple. I know this because
*  you always use the example. There you go. I'm just a really good divergent thinker.
*  There you are. You're very creative. What you just did also is another part of, as I was looking
*  through the literature, that I didn't see a lot of work in understanding creativity from a
*  psychological perspective or a neuroscientific perspective is even, especially on the divergent
*  side especially, even when you give a solution that seems novel. The way those solutions are
*  generally rated, we break them down. There's like a fluency. There's the number of ideas that you
*  would give and then there's flexibility, the number of distinct categories of thought,
*  and there's originality, which is how novel that is. A lot of times, you can think about the
*  different ways you can have raters rate them for novelty or you could just take a statistical,
*  say 5% of people gave this answer or less, so we'll call it novel. There's different ways to measure
*  that. One of the things I came back to was if I have two people or three people who gave the same
*  answer for something and one of those people, let's say I use a brick for whatever, I use a
*  brick to sit on around a campfire and one person went camping last weekend and sat on a brick at
*  the campfire, well, like that process that's underlying what the end product was is really
*  kind of not differentiated in terms of if I'm just giving responses and I'm looking at the
*  neurological response of that, I feel like there hasn't been much work really diving in there.
*  For me, I saw all these different kinds of standardized assessments of creativity and
*  I felt like the best way to assess creativity would be to look at a specific domain and then
*  to start to look at domains that would be close to that thing and start to look for overlapping
*  neural activations and patterns of thinking throughout different domains that could be,
*  you could say, okay, these are consistent with music performance, this is consistent with dance,
*  this is consistent with art, but when we boil it down, we see these commonalities
*  in terms of creative performance. I've tended to stay away from the standardized assessments,
*  for better or worse, and tried to approach one field and get a sense of creativity there and
*  compare it to other people doing work in other specific domains.
*  You mentioned you had these ideas going into graduate school. Were you going to always be an
*  entrepreneur? Oh, man, we're taking a turn. Yeah, we'll get back. We'll get back. So you run secret
*  chord laboratories. You co-founded secret chord laboratories. We'll take a side road here for a
*  minute. Yeah, sure. No. I never set out to be an entrepreneur when I started to do the research.
*  The work for secret chord laboratories is very related to, I was doing music production and I
*  met my co-founder. We always joke that he came to my, I had two great advisors in grad school.
*  John, who was my psychology and cognitive neuroscience advisor, and I had Youngmoo Kim,
*  who was an electrical engineer, who was my advisor at a place called the Music Entertainment
*  Technology Lab at Drexel. Before Spotify and Pandora and basically before the big companies
*  came over and took over all this music information retrieval research, which is basically taking an
*  audio signal and breaking it down and understanding certain properties of it in terms of musical
*  content. He was like, that lab was sending, but the engineers were going to places like Gray Snow
*  from Nielsen or like Spotify. And so he had all these people who were understanding the signal
*  there. I was the first psychology recruit into that lab because he was from the MIT media lab and he
*  saw this value in interdisciplinarity. And so he's like, okay, well, music is really,
*  if you're not understanding the brain and the perception of music, if I'm going to have a music
*  entertainment technology lab, I'm missing a huge component. So I was lucky that I was in,
*  I was in Philadelphia at the time. I was a teacher actually. I was teaching sixth grade.
*  And my best, one of my best buddies who I'd been in a band with for 10 years, he was an engineer in
*  this lab and he, I was like living with him and he was, he said, Hey, there's this opportunity to,
*  it's like interdisciplinary position between the ACBS program, applied and cognitive brain sciences
*  with in psychology and then the music entertainment technology lab. Are you interested?
*  And so that's how it started. And my co-founder, Scott Miles, he, he came to my lab one day looking
*  for the perfect compliment to his neuroscience research on music enjoyment. So that work goes
*  back. That started with Leonard Meyer going back in 1956 with a music and meaning where he outlined
*  basically this, these ideas of tension and release ultimately leading to feeling emotion in music.
*  And then we joke that he had found the perfect engineer. He found the perfect guy for the project.
*  And then that guy left and he took a job somewhere in San Francisco and he got stuck with me,
*  someone with the same exact skill set that he had.
*  Okay. Yeah. Not, not the, not, not the desired potential for a, a super duo forming a company.
*  Yeah. It wasn't a, to start, it was two neuroscientists who were music geeks, both
*  musicians. And then, so basically that work was, we wanted to empirically test this idea that,
*  you know, tension and release. And ultimately the tension is surprise in music that we could
*  quantify surprise and say that in the most popular songs ever, the billboard charts,
*  there is something quantifiably and empirically different between the top performing songs of all
*  time and those that were not as high charting is how the research really started. And me being the,
*  the scenic, you know, music guy that I was studying music production was like, yeah, right, Scott.
*  Like there's so many, there's so many variables, like, you know, how attractive is the musician
*  or like how much, which label was backing it or, you know, so many different, so many different
*  pieces. And so we continue to do that. We started to do that work and we statistically showed that
*  those top songs were looking at harmony only to start, had more harmonic surprise, but that was
*  the start was a statistical analysis of past music. And then we took that and did a behavioral study
*  with algorithmically generated music and gave that to subjects with a harmonic surprise modeled
*  after those songs that we had analyzed from over, it was about 33 years of pop music from Johnny B
*  Good, This Smells Like Teen Spirit from 58 to 91 was the initial research. And then we both graduated
*  and, you know, we went our, went our different ways and I started to teach psychology and I was
*  looking for jobs. There was a one year position. So I was looking for jobs. I actually had just
*  taken a job at Wesleyan as for a one year visiting gig two weeks earlier. And Scott calls me up.
*  This is about a year or a year or so after we graduate. And Scott says, Hey, we just got accepted
*  into project music. It's a Google for startups, a music tech accelerator. We're going to make a
*  business out of this. That's really how I ended up becoming an entrepreneur and, you know, doing
*  that for the last two years. You actually learned some useful skills in your education, huh?
*  I did learn some, the skills of me, the skills of definitely definitely from John.
*  So you're using the neuroscience of creativity and analyzing songs and using that as a service
*  to help people decide what's gonna, what's gonna bring enjoyment to people's lives.
*  Right. I would say it is as directly connected to there. There is overlap. I like in terms of
*  the neuroscience of creativity. When I think about the dual process model that we haven't gotten
*  there yet, but we talk about dual process model, which in a way is like kind of based on our two
*  memory systems, which with Kahneman and Tversky have laid out in terms of like system one,
*  which is like you're, you're unconscious, you know, highly efficient, like kind of like automatic
*  system that's underlying things as you, you know, you kind of learn habits and you interact
*  with your world. You learn how to behave in certain situations, just like automatically.
*  Right. And you have your, your second system, memory system, system two, which is more
*  effortful and attention, you need focus. And it takes up more cognitive resources.
*  And, you know, we talk about that in terms of creative production on the side of, you know,
*  when do you need to, when do you need to turn things off and kind of like, you know, lose
*  control. And there's other times when you, when you might, such as making a mistake or tripping
*  up or you're not familiar with the tune where you need to, you know, be more effortful. So when we
*  think about things in those two systems, ultimately the work at Seeker Cord boils down to a key metric
*  that we have quantified and now we have patents pending on, which is called familiar surprise.
*  And so surprise is ultimately a measure of entropy, Shannon entropy at different,
*  different orders. Right. So basically given a corpus of music, music that's happened before,
*  that's out in the world to listeners ears, you know, from the time you're in the womb,
*  you're developing expectations in your culture and your society of like what sounds go together.
*  So familiar surprise that does is okay. So that those two components really map onto nicely the
*  same systems that are key to creativity. Right. So there's surprise, which is that first system.
*  It's unconscious. It's kind of like how our brains, you know, we track statistical regularities
*  in our environment, but we don't do so in a conscious, in a conscious way. And so we want
*  a certain amount of surprise in terms of the new things that we hear. Right. We've, we established
*  that in the, with Seeker Cord in the statistical analysis and the research and then in a behavioral
*  study. And now we've done it like looking way beyond just songs from the past and just harmony.
*  And we're looking now at, you know, melody, rhythm, timbre, texture, and dynamics. We have these,
*  and harmony, those six features. And we're looking at surprise on the song level across all of those
*  features. And so what you see, so on that surprise, okay, so that's like the unconscious part is
*  mapping out surprise. But if you just had surprise going back to like when we were talking about jazz,
*  right, maybe you, you pick something out and to you at that moment, it's like the most creative
*  thing that you could do. Right. But if you have too much surprise, like if I give an acid jazz song
*  to a pop listener, right. Well, that's not grounded, right. That's not grounded in familiarity,
*  which is ultimately what I would think is that second system. It's, it's what we're conscious of.
*  It's the songs that we can sing from, you know, our memory. It's the songs that we have,
*  we have deep emotional connections to. It's the songs that we identify with because a lot of the
*  scene of popular music in commercial commercially viable music, we think about like, you know,
*  if you ask someone, I ask Paul, what's your favorite? When do you think the best music was ever made?
*  Whenever, how much is that doggy in the window was written?
*  Is that your favorite?
*  But I was going to ask you if the beach where the beach boys are in your,
*  I don't know. I'll go Hendrix. I'll go that era.
*  Okay. And how old were you when, when you discovered Hendrix?
*  I know where this is going. Yeah. So when I was listening to electric lady land over and over,
*  I was probably 15. Yeah.
*  Right. So I mean, that's, I think that's where the, the familiarity and the meaning
*  and the emotional associations are grounded, right. So from a certain era, there's certain
*  music that's played and that we have, you know, that's the reason why we can listen to songs over
*  and over. When I talk about surprise, usually the first questions I get is like, well, then how can
*  you explain the fact that, um, we listen to this, that people listen to the same songs throughout
*  their whole life. And I'll, I'll talk and I'll speak to a different, I answer that with a different
*  phenomenon and say, well, you can do that because when you're optimizing both of those memory systems
*  and hijacking them, that there are things in those songs that are surprising given the entire
*  corpus of music, but these surprising moments you are familiar with. Right. So it's like kind of this
*  idea of, you know, you get off when you're at a concert and you know, something like really crazy
*  is going to happen and you, you might nudge the person next to you and like tell them to prepare.
*  There's this part of like, no, there's this like anticipatory knowing of the surprise.
*  And then the other piece is like, if you look at your grandparents or even your parents or a
*  generation, um, we have found with your secret chord is that these patterns of surprise aren't
*  static. So over time you need more and more surprise. We have an upcoming paper that's going to be
*  published, uh, this month about the effects over time. That it's those top, the difference between
*  top and bottom performing songs, they diverged in terms of you need more and more surprise,
*  almost like a drug to get the same effects. And so as you keep having, as culture evolves and music
*  evolves because it's a part of culture, the music that becomes popular is almost, uh, it's,
*  it can't even be recognized as music to people who appreciated music two decades, three decades,
*  four decades ago. And that's why you get that thing of it's like, this doesn't even sound like
*  music anymore. And like, eventually, you know, that's, and that kind of phenomenon occurs like
*  over and over. John, I'm pretty old. You might be a couple of years older than me. Are they just
*  whippersnappers doing, uh, making racket these days? What's going on with that?
*  I think I'm a lot older than you, I'm sure.
*  You got my, how much is that doggy in the window reference? I think so.
*  Uh, yeah, I got that. I know that song.
*  Probably 1930s, 20s. I don't know. Long time ago. Um, I don't go that far back.
*  You know, the music I listened to was written hundreds of years ago. So generally, so, uh,
*  you know, I think what Dave is describing, uh, applies to, uh, popular music, except in as much
*  as there's, there's a, a phenomenon in classical music where, uh, people tend to cling to the
*  specific performances or recordings, uh, that, uh, where they're first, they were first introduced
*  to a work. So there's a whole, there's a whole genre in, uh, classical recordings of, of sort
*  of these, uh, nostalgia reissues of performers, you know, recordings that were recorded in the
*  1950s and sixties, whatever. Uh, and it may have been the first performance of person heard of,
*  say, Beethoven's fifth or Mahler's first symphony or something like that. And people do tend to
*  cling to those. Um, so that, that may be a, uh, a similar thing. Uh, but in terms of
*  upping the ante, coming up with more and more surprise, that's clearly the case over hundreds
*  of years in classical music as well. It's become, you know, more and more extreme to the point where
*  the, the, the surprise is no longer a factor because everything is so extreme that the surprising
*  thing would be for it to not be surprising or extreme. Well, let's segue here. And I want to,
*  cause I want to bring in the Eureka factor book and your work on insight, John, before we get into
*  the, the, you know, creativity larger, the larger question of creativity and the neuroscience of it.
*  I mean, I'll just ask you, what, what is the relationship between creativity and insight?
*  And you know, what are some of the features of, of insight as opposed to just creativity more
*  broadly? Okay. So insight as defined by experimental psychologists is any sudden
*  realization. It could be the solution to a problem. It could be a new perspective, a new idea.
*  But the, the emphasis is on the sudden part of the realization. So often, uh, and another term for it
*  is the aha moment. Now in the popular jargon, the term aha moment is a little more general.
*  So when people talk about aha moments in colloquial speech, they often mean any deep understanding
*  that they've achieved or something. Uh, the definition of experimental psychology is more
*  specific. It has to be sudden. You, you, things snap into place. All of a sudden you see things
*  in a new light. And the study of insight began, oh, back around the time of World War I
*  by the Gestalt psychologist in Germany, who were, who noticed this phenomenon in perception. You
*  could look at a visual illusion or an ambiguous figure and then suddenly see it reverse and see
*  it in a different way. And they started applying that to problem solving. And they realized that
*  often you're stuck on a problem. And then all of a sudden you realize you've been thinking about
*  the problem in the wrong way. That aha moment then shows that the solution of the problem is
*  actually simple. You had made it more complicated than it needed to be, perhaps because you were
*  distracted by irrelevant features of the problem or whatever. Uh, so what insight is, it's, it's a
*  mechanism that the brain has for making something that is not obvious, obvious. And it, it's, uh,
*  that change of perception or of representation happens suddenly. And it has a certain force.
*  Often there's a, a feeling of emotion associated with it. A person may have an emotional rush. Oh,
*  now I see it, see it the way it really is. Uh, it also comes with a feeling of certainty and
*  obviousness. Once you, you've restructured your idea of the problem or the, the situation, it's
*  like, oh yeah, that's obvious to me now. That is a form of creativity in the sense that
*  creativity more generally, uh, is a collection of processes that, um, will allow you to come up with
*  something that isn't obvious. So if, if, uh, if something is obvious, then it can't be creative
*  because everybody can do it. So we kind of value creativity as being something that is hard to come
*  by. I mean, anyone can do it, but it's not something we necessarily do all the time. Uh,
*  so creativity is a way to, to conceive of things that are at least potentially useful or interesting,
*  but that are not obvious to begin with. Uh, and so there are other forms of creativity and, you know,
*  we can get into sort of a dual process model. Yeah, we might as well anytime you want, because,
*  you know, David's already mentioned it. Yeah. So do the dual process approach to creativity.
*  It's actually not a single model. It's sort of a collection of related models. It's sort of a
*  framework for thinking about it. So, uh, if, if you want to think about it in terms of, uh,
*  Kahneman Tversky or Kahneman, at least talking about system one and system two,
*  nowadays we talk about type one and type two. So type one processes are unconscious,
*  associative, relatively automatic, and you just make connections unconsciously outside of awareness.
*  And every once in a while, something will pop into awareness, uh, and it'll be like an intuition or
*  an insight. Whereas type two processing is slower. It's effortful. It's conscious. It's deliberate.
*  It's what you do when I ask you to in your head, add together the numbers 47 and 392. You don't,
*  it's not just going to pop into your head unless you have some unique ability to do that. It's
*  something you have to work through in a conscious, deliberate way. So insights come from, uh, the type
*  one processing. The type two processing is when we sort of deliberately grapple with a problem.
*  But, but insight also requires this incubation period after sort of hitting the wall, right?
*  Of when you're working on your problem, using a, a type two deliberate, effortful, conscious process.
*  And then you got to take, that's when you take the walk, take the shower, take the nap.
*  Yeah, that's a common misconception. Uh, often insights do occur after a person has reached an
*  impasse. They're stuck. They've exhausted the way that they're looking at the problem. And then they
*  can take a break, go off, maybe take a shower, take a walk and have an insight. But sometimes
*  insights occur without any particular problem. Sometimes you could be walking down the street
*  and you have an idea. It's a great idea. It pops into your awareness and it's the solution to a
*  problem you didn't even know you had. Right. Okay. Right. So insights do not have to, uh,
*  do not depend on first having an impasse and being blocked. Often that's the way it happens. And those
*  can be particularly memorable after the fact, because it's this, you know, tension and release
*  thing. It's you're stuck, you're tense. You don't know what you're going to do. You give up for a
*  while and then, ah, it comes to you. Right. But that, that, you know, those ideas can come to you
*  even when I'll give you a concrete example that we have in the book. So in the early 1940s,
*  there was a, uh, an engineer aboard a U S Navy ship. And his job was to, uh, attach gauges and
*  other instruments to springs, uh, so that they would be sort of like shock absorbers. So that
*  when the ship was being buffeted about in choppy seas, the instruments would stay, uh, more stable
*  so that people could read them. So he was working with these springs, one got away from him and it
*  started bouncing around the room and sort of like, you know, uh, back walking almost. Right. And in
*  that instant he had the sudden insight. You could make a toy out of it. And after tinkering and
*  refining, it became the slinky. So now was he thinking about how do I come up with a design
*  for a toy when that happened? No, he saw it. That triggered the insight, the aha moment that that
*  would make a great toy. Uh, so it would, he had not been, uh, blocked on solving a problem. He had
*  not reached an impasse. He just had a great idea. It just occurred to him from nowhere. So that,
*  that's an example of a situation where you can have an insight that solves a problem that you
*  didn't even know you had. You say it came from nowhere, but he probably had memories of toys and
*  memories of springs, uh, and absolutely to get into the shactor type of a memory is creativity is
*  imagination and simulation. But, um, yeah, so that, um, so maybe not out of nowhere, but, uh,
*  but definitely not a problem of inventing toys for the sh for the crew. Right. No, no ideas,
*  no idea comes completely out of nowhere because, uh, new ideas are based on, they have to be based
*  on the knowledge you have. They can't be based on the ideas and knowledge you don't have. I mean,
*  they have to be based, they have to be combinations of things that you already have in your brain in
*  one way or another. Um, in order to, um, uh, I mean, you could combine two ideas, come up with
*  a new idea and then combine that with something else, but it still has to be based on the basic
*  building blocks that you have. One of the things I was, I thought of reading your book, um, I
*  recently did an episode about consciousness and, you know, the computational approaches to
*  consciousness. And this is another sort of wild west area. So I've kind of compared these in my
*  head a little bit, consciousness and creativity. Part of the definition of insight is that it is a
*  conscious moment, right? You are aware of the, of the insight and just by definition of being
*  insight. Um, but the more we study the brain and it's functioning, the more we realize that almost
*  everything that we thought, uh, was only conscious, a conscious process. There's a lot of unconscious
*  processing going on. That's basically doing the same thing, but it just made me think, ah, is this,
*  you know, is this a function of a potential function of consciousness to, to, because when you
*  have the, uh, aha moment, the insight, uh, it is a solution and you realize it's a solution. And is
*  that a function of consciousness to, to make one realize a potential solution and then therefore
*  be able to act upon that solution? That may very well be the case. Yeah, it may very well be the
*  case. The study of, uh, of insight, uh, really started to take off in recent years with the,
*  the use of neuroscience methods, neuroimaging methods, where we could look at what the brain
*  was doing even when a person was not conscious of it. So, you know, when you have an insight,
*  it pops into awareness in a way that's seemingly disconnected from the ongoing stream of thought
*  because the brain had been working on that at some kind of unconscious level.
*  When that process has run to completion, the contents or the result of that gets dumped into
*  consciousness. That enables you in some sense to use that information, that insight, that idea
*  for things to, to, to act on it in the world. The ultimate example is like in dreaming, right? When
*  we're ultimately, when we're ultimately not having normal waking consciousness. And then basically
*  what you are aware of is kind of this latent state and associations that, you know, that kind of,
*  you know, brings it to the forefront. It's a state where we're, you know, and the brain is like
*  operating with different oscillations and that's what we're aware of. Um, you know, as kind of you,
*  you become more aware of what's that latent state that's going on under the hood because
*  you're ultimately not waking. Yeah. And in fact, uh, you can have an insight while you're sleeping
*  and it can wake you up. You wake up in the middle of the night with an idea or has that ever happened
*  to you? That's never happened to me. It's happened to me a lot of times. Yes. And, and, uh, it does,
*  it does happen. Um, well, maybe you shouldn't be jealous if you get your insights during the day,
*  that's better. Cause you don't lose sleep that way. So when I get awakened by an idea in the
*  middle of the night, I mean, even if it's a bad one, I can't go back to sleep and I'm, you know,
*  I'm stuck miserable the next day. Uh, but, but it does, it, it absolutely happens. And a lot of
*  people would, if they want to have an idea, they take a nap during the day to generate an idea.
*  And, uh, actually a little story was that, uh, when we finished the manuscript for the Eureka factor,
*  the publication date was approaching and, uh, every title that we came up with, potential title,
*  our editor hated it. He just didn't like any of these titles. So we were getting nervous because
*  my coauthor, Mark Beeman and I, because, uh, we didn't have a title and we didn't want them to
*  push back the publication date. Uh, so, uh, my wife, who's actually, she's a event, she's an,
*  uh, an editor, former journalist and writer. She said, well, I'm going to use the, I'm going to help
*  you. I'm going to use the advice in the book. I'm going to take a nap and I'll come up with the,
*  the title. So she, she went to bed. I went up, up to bed in the bedroom. She fell asleep on the couch
*  in the family room. And then like one or two in the morning, she comes and she wakes up, I have the
*  title. I have the title. I said, yeah, you would tell me in the morning. No, no, no, no, I've got
*  the title, the Eureka factor. And I said, sounds great. Tell, remind me in the morning. So in the
*  morning I emailed the editor and he liked it and that's what we stuck with. But, uh, it came to her
*  while she was napping on the couch. And a lot of people get ideas like that.
*  Did you get, did you go back to sleep after that? Oh yes, absolutely. Absolutely. It wasn't your idea.
*  Yeah. You have another idea generator. If it was my idea, I probably would have been up the rest of
*  the night. Do you know, I don't know if this is apocryphal or not, but, um, I've told this story to
*  my younger cousins. Uh, apparently Thomas Edison would, he'd be thinking about a problem and
*  he would have his napping chair and he would hold these couple, like large ball bearings in his hand
*  and he'd relax in the chair and underneath him would be a metal pan. And as soon as he relaxed
*  enough that he was like drifting off, the ball bearings would fall out of his hand, hit the pan
*  and make the noise and make a racket and wake him up. And that's how he would take his afternoon
*  nap to generate his insights. Well, you know, that's really interesting. I've heard that story
*  too. I believe that it is true, but it's very interesting that Edison did that because his
*  public persona was of a person who worked through things in a very deliberate way.
*  He did thousands of experiments to sort of home in on an idea and make it work. And he did, you
*  know, he would sit 99% perspiration, 1% inspiration. And yet, you know, here he's using this method to
*  come up with ideas out of, out of the ether, out of the vapor to, to generate insights. And he didn't
*  really talk about that so much. So he, he wasn't fully forthcoming about how he came up with his
*  ideas. Yeah, I can't imagine. Well, um, so, you know, in the book, um, in the Eureka factor,
*  aptly named by your wife, you lucky man, that you talk a lot about the neuroscience, EEG studies,
*  fMRI studies, and a lot of just about the cognition around insights. And that might come back, but in
*  the interest of time, let's, let's move on and talk about the, the creativity and jazz improv,
*  this series of studies that, that you guys have done recently here. So most creativity research
*  in the history, and I know it's kind of a new thing. You said, you know, it's like 20 years
*  since the neuroscience of creativity has started, but it seems like most, most research on creativity
*  has focused on sort of just the overall levels of creativity in individuals, as if creativity is
*  some blanket thing that you just flip the switch or turn the dial up. And it's kind of the same
*  thing in everyone. But what you guys have been studying is creativity as a function of, of
*  expertise in domains. And the reason why I asked about jazz to begin with is because you guys use
*  jazz improvisation as a more ecologically valid way to study creativity. So, so in, in neuroscience,
*  a lot, you know, you have these animal models, right? So you, you know, let's say a mouse or a rat
*  in a lab, and there's a lot of concern these days about, well, you know, a rat would never do a water
*  maze task or a T maze task in the wild. So then, you know, we need ecologically valid tasks to
*  actually get at the neural mechanisms underpinning what they might actually see in the wild. And as
*  weird to think of jazz improv as being an ecological, ecologically valid task, but is that
*  pretty much accepted in the creativity community? So jazz has gotten quite a bit of attention.
*  It's I think it's gained a lot of interest because of the type of what jazz improvisation requires.
*  It's incredibly demanding, cognitively, and kind of when you when you just when you witness it,
*  at times it seems almost as if it's it's magical. Like how is it that these four people are playing
*  and this is like made up on this spot and actually they're together and like, how does that
*  really happen at the highest levels? So I think as you pointed out, Paul, a lot of this is looked at
*  saying, hey, create this is like a type of creativity. Let's just say that all jazz
*  improvisation is the same. And like there have been more and more studies kind of looking at
*  jazz improvisation with that. Hey, this is improvisation compared to X compared to another
*  task, a memorized melody or kind of some unique component. But not really not really looking at
*  the creativity of those moments and not just the creativity of those moments broadly, but how that
*  creativity is achieved by the individual. And I think that what that really digs into is the
*  distinction between creative products and creative process, which I think really was at the core
*  of this work of looking at expertise. We did a set of three different studies. The first study
*  was, as you joked in the beginning, be creative. So that'll come back now. We brought in a bunch
*  of keyboardists and had them improvise to a set of novel chord sequences they had never seen before.
*  And halfway through the performance, after a number of takes, we asked them to be more creative.
*  And the idea there was that, well, this what I was thinking at the time was a bit naive,
*  was that jazz musicians, you're trying to reach a level where you automatize those sensory kind
*  of sensory memories and also kind of motor actions that will ultimately deliver those sounds and
*  understanding how they will sound against different chords and different harmonies.
*  And then you can be more free by understanding by having certain things, you know, routinize
*  and habitualized. You can then take that vocabulary and understanding and apply it in a number of
*  a wide range of jazz, different songs, different chord changes as they come up, because you can
*  abstract those sequences into and chunk them into like, you know, broader areas where you can then
*  kind of play around a little bit. But as it turned out, in that first study, you know,
*  it wasn't just that when we asked people to be creative, people were able to flip a switch and
*  say, okay, I'm going to like enter my creative state now. Instead, what it did was it actually
*  had a differential effect among the population of pianists that we had in that study. So
*  we started to look at one of the variables that had a really significant interaction with the
*  condition of whether you were being asked to be creative, or just playing normally, where there
*  were really no instructions, it was just like kind of improvised. And it seemed to be that expertise
*  combined with the instruction condition significantly predicted the quality ratings
*  that we had obtained from judges, which was our way of measure our way of a metric, we had four
*  judges blindly rate improvisations. They weren't just judges off the street. These were music
*  teachers around there. They were jazz professionals, or teachers who have been playing or studying jazz
*  for over 25 years. And so what happened really to get to the to get to the meat of it, novices,
*  when asked to be creative, they performed better, they had higher significantly higher ratings,
*  they improved more, they became more create relatively more creative, they became relatively
*  more creative to themselves. So that's a real Paul, you pointed out a really important piece there
*  is that this was within subject analyses. So rather than just taking each person and saying,
*  Okay, here's a take or two, or looking at was the difference that the experts would, you know,
*  within each person would, you know, get better or worse, the tent, depending on that condition,
*  they would relatively become better. And the experts, it hindered their performance. And it
*  was significant at both ends of at both ends of the scale. You know, and so that led us to
*  a lot more, many more questions. But it pointed out something that we thought was really worth
*  considering. And it was a paradigm that hadn't really been explored much is to see how expertise
*  may ultimately affect the types of cognitive processes and the way that we approach
*  behaviorally and metacognitively and neurologically, a creative task. And so we set out after after
*  that study to look at two other studies, which I can dive into or we can jump.
*  Is that when did you guys did you? Because we when I was a postdoc, we in a year or so after I left
*  is when the trans cranial direct current stimulation started becoming becoming popular,
*  you know, put a little sponge on your head, put a nine volt battery on there and turn it on. And
*  all of a sudden, you're a concert pianist or whatever. So is that I mean, and you know, and so
*  a lab I was associated with, I'd never did any of this research, but they started doing it,
*  we started talking about, you know, trying to trying to do things, you know, with monkeys,
*  using this setup. And so anyway, the trans cranial direct current simulation kind of exploded,
*  I guess, in the past 10 years, my dates are off on these things. But so is that did that? Did you
*  have these devices laying around? Or is that when you thought, hey, let's buy some of these? And or
*  here's the here's here's the real question. Were you guys using these in your homes beforehand?
*  For your own musical? That's a serious question, though, it really is, because I know people,
*  you know. So I didn't we didn't have at the time, a neural neural stimulation. Okay, that wasn't
*  that wasn't the thought right right away. But now I mean, really to diverge real quickly. Now
*  there's like a there's like a whole field of in terms of the entrepreneurship side, as you know,
*  because all kinds of neuroscience companies that are basically, you know, digging into the, you know,
*  TDCS and brain stimulation for you name, you name the task, you know, from from creativity to
*  athletic performance to attention, a better lover, I'm sure. I'm sure I mean, you'll get everything.
*  So that that you're so you're saying to TDCS, that was the next that was the next study was
*  raised to say, OK, now, it was cool. It's cool that TDCS to me was we were doing that was it kind of
*  flips the neuroimaging paradigm on its head. Right. So like when you're doing a neuroimaging study,
*  you are asking someone to do or different groups of people to do a task or two different tasks.
*  And then you're looking at brain activity to determine what's the underlying neural
*  mechanisms for how this is occurring. And when you when you flip it around the brain stimulation,
*  what you see is you say, OK, now we have because of past research, we have an understanding of what
*  we think these brain areas are doing and how they're contributing to in our in our case,
*  creativity more broadly. So if we target these areas and ultimately modulate the the
*  electrophysiology of the brain, can we see a difference in the output in the actual behavior
*  of people next was trying to recruit jazz pianists to go to volunteer, not volunteer,
*  they get paid a little bit, but basically volunteer to have their heads zapped and come in for three
*  sessions to do this. And so what we did was we targeted the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex.
*  Might be worth backing up because we've already talked about the dual process model, but we haven't
*  really talked about, you know, the systems related to the those two processes related to the dual
*  process, those being the default mode network, the executive function network, and then the salience
*  network to mediate between them. You might want to just say a few words of like why you put it over
*  the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex to begin with, right? Well, the the the system one system two or
*  type one type two distinction, the distinction between largely unconscious associated processes
*  on one hand system one and conscious deliberate methodical processes, the system two type two,
*  that distinction came before there were any neuroimaging studies. So
*  neuroimaging studies have uncovered various networks in the brain such as the executive
*  network and the default mode network, etc. They don't these things don't map onto each other
*  theoretically that well. So the executive network, sure that's like type two system two
*  processing. The default mode network is not the same thing as type one system one processing. The
*  default mode network is the collection of brain areas that are engaged when you don't have a test
*  to perform or when the test you're performing is very undemanding. So your your mind can wander,
*  essentially. And when your mind wanders, it tends to think about various things like
*  things about the future planning for the future, thinks about yourself, it may think about past
*  memories of interest, etc. It's usually centered around yourself, but it's conscious, a lot of
*  it's conscious, there are probably unconscious aspects of it that go along with it. Whereas
*  the type one type two distinction, type one is unconscious processing. So those two ways of
*  looking at it, executive and default don't really map on perfectly to the system one system two.
*  That's one of the reasons when I mentioned dual process is a framework. It's not a single model.
*  There's more than one model that talks about two different processes like that. So in the salience
*  network, again, that's not incorporated into the type one type two thinking salience network,
*  essentially, grabs your attention when something important or striking has happened. And it could
*  be something that happens externally, like, you know, a car backfiring outside, or something
*  internal, such as, you know, a sudden idea, some insight or a thought that grabs your attention.
*  But so the idea of putting the stimulating the brain in at the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex
*  is so in the first study, you said be creative. And in that way, you made creative people worse,
*  or experts worse, or not as they didn't improve as much, whereas novices improved a lot. And they
*  were so in the second study, you thought, well, if we stimulate the brain, as a proxy for saying
*  be creative, we might get the same effect. Is that right? Well, let me interpose something here. So
*  when you give a person a command, a task, a goal, goal activation, it engages executive processing.
*  So if I say, you know, pick up that glass on the table, something like that, you have to deliberately
*  engage mental processes that are involved in locating the glass, locating the table,
*  you know, using your willpower essentially to follow through that it focuses your attention.
*  Those are executive processes. Those are largely a function of dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex
*  activity. There are other areas of the brain involved too, but dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex,
*  sort of the front on the sides of the brain, that is engaged when you have goal directed
*  cognition. And that's the link between the two here. If you stimulate dorsal lateral prefrontal
*  cortex, we were hypothesizing or hoping or whatever, that that would in some way interact
*  with this goal directed cognition that requires that part of the brain.
*  I'll let Dave take the rest of it here. Yeah, we're trying to like really, I mean,
*  get to the bottom. We had some different hypotheses around potentially what was happening
*  for the experts, potentially when they were asked the question, when they were asked to be more
*  creative, you know, potentially when they were performing before, because they were experts,
*  they already kind of, you know, when they improvise, they improvise, they know what they're
*  doing. And when asked to now focus on a new goal, like I've done a number of things, I could have
*  just the goal activation itself could have increased, you know, kind of executive function
*  type one processes, or it could have been something else like, you know, they were
*  thinking they were already creative. And like, why, who are you some scientists like telling me
*  to be more creative? And we're hypothesizing for the on the other end for the novices,
*  you know, rather than being limited by kind of they were new and having this new task and
*  kind of probably approached it a more, you know, a simple level, just, you know, think outside the
*  box and to take take more chances and risks. And so even just even just the question itself
*  was potentially the direction was, you know, interpreted very differently by those different
*  by those different groups and perceived in that way. So when we did the stimulation,
*  you know, we were trying to get a sense of, let me just interpose. So the but the idea is that when
*  you tell someone, now be creative, you're giving them something extra to do. And that should engage
*  executive processing, it should engage dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, because it's it's a conscious
*  decision that they have to do something, which screw up the experts in their in their creative
*  endeavor, screw up the experts, right. So right. So in terms of then we basically said with the
*  brain stimulation study, there are two types of stimulation. And then there's kind of a third
*  type, which is a control. So you have you have a nodal stimulation, which is excitatory to right
*  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex cathodal stimulation is thought to be inhibitory, but the effects
*  aren't as reliable, especially in like kind of higher cognitive tasks. And the third condition
*  is a sham condition where basically you turn on the the TDCS, they feel something for 30 seconds,
*  and then it shuts off because really the time when you feel anything is during the the changing
*  of current. Once it hits that steady state after about 30 seconds, it's it's unrequited. You can't
*  tell if you're if you're in or not. Actually, a funny funny anecdote around that is we had one
*  kind of anxious, anxious pianist who came in for this study, and it was during his sham condition.
*  And, you know, during some of the we did we did, you know, we did basically the improv tasks. And
*  after the improv tasks, we did a series of cognitive tasks and insight tasks, the creativity tasks,
*  because we wanted to basically throw us in. Once you have some people who are willing to get brain
*  stimulation, you throw a bunch of different tasks to see, like what else you can find afterwards.
*  So in the middle of in the middle of one of the insight tasks, the guy like took a fit. It was
*  just like, I can't like I can't think I can't do anything because I feel like my brain's been
*  stimulated and messed with. And I'm sitting there as the experimenter. You know, I can't like I
*  can't even I can't even crack like a smile of seeing like, oh, man, this is like this is the
*  same. This is the sham session. So at least we know that that that's working. So to bring it back,
*  again, what we found was, you know, it was with a limited sample. It was only 17 pianists.
*  But we saw was that the a nodal stimulation significantly improved the performance of novices
*  and it significantly hindered the performance of experts, similar to the the way that that what we
*  had hypothesized was happening with the just the instruction of the goal, you know, increasing
*  executive function and which is helpful for novice when you need to have that kind of like
*  that control in what you're doing. Because if if you relax that control, you're not there yet.
*  Like you're you're really going to just like fall off, especially with new, you know, with new
*  stimuli, which is what these were. And that's like a interest. That's a methodological decision that
*  I've thought about quite a bit. And in terms of the you mentioned how accepted is jazz improvisation,
*  I would say that while jazz improvisation is as a form of creativity generally is of high interest
*  in the academic community, there is repeated results on similar replicability on on these
*  stimuli. I know that like the ones that I use were novel because we were trying to we had made them
*  up to be, you know, they they're very much like jazz. Some like standards had like some two, five
*  ones and like common progressions that if you're a jazz musician, you would see. But we were trying
*  to eliminate the influence of like specific experience. And like that's why we didn't give
*  like blue bossa, you know, to people because we were trying to really focus on that, you know,
*  this spontaneity of performance. And so, you know, with so that's that's something I've noticed,
*  like throughout the literature, everyone is kind of while they're saying that improvisation is is
*  useful task to look at the people, including myself in the studies, they're not looking at
*  similar stimuli. And I'm not certain yet. So, you know, what effect that might have on some of the
*  results. I think something is important to think about. It seems like there's a lot of variables
*  that that that can be pushed around and manipulated. And it's the Wild West. There's a lot of questions
*  and answered. So should we go on to the EEG finally? The EEG caps on.
*  Yeah, so actually, let me just take a step back from him. So if MRI has great spatial resolution,
*  it can tell you it's okay. It's pretty it's pretty darn and it's getting better all the time.
*  True, true. It's better than EEG.
*  Yes, better spatial resolution. But it has fairly low temporal resolution. It's not great at telling
*  you exactly when something's happening with the brain. And EEG has great temporal resolution. It's
*  really good at telling you when something's happening in the brain. It's less good at telling
*  you where something's happening in the brain. That said, the temporal resolution of fMRI is
*  getting better all the time. And the spatial resolution of EEG is getting better all the time.
*  So yes, we've been using an analytic approach that is best, you know, mostly identified with fMRI.
*  We've been applying it to EEG to improve spatial resolution to get a better idea of where things
*  are happening in the brain. So the thing that's unique about this study is we use both the experts
*  and non experts, but we also compared the best and worst performances within experts and best
*  and worst performances within novices. So we were able to sort of disentangle the relative
*  contributions of expertise and other factors which could lead to a better or worse performance or
*  more creative versus less creative performance. And what we found, generally speaking, to sort
*  of summarize it would be that novices, when they are giving their best performances, they're relying
*  mostly on frontal, particularly right frontal parts of the brain. And the experts, when they're
*  giving their best performances, they're relying more on left hemisphere, left posterior parts of
*  the brain. So what makes a performance more creative versus less creative is different from
*  what makes a performance emanate from an expert versus a novice. They're different processes that
*  novices and experts use to get the most creativity out of what they're doing.
*  What does that tell us about creativity? Is creativity one thing? I mean, it's, you know,
*  okay, all right, go ahead. This is a favorite topic. This is a favorite topic. So
*  this is one way to look at it. For the novices, improvisation was not yet a
*  fully automatic or familiar task. For them, it was a relatively novel task. So their ability
*  to improvise creatively depended on their ability to deal with this relatively novel task.
*  Whereas for the experts, their ability to improvise creatively depended on squeezing the most out of
*  their automatic baked in processes. So if you're talking about novices, we're talking about a
*  creative ability, which is the ability to deal with novel situations. If you're talking about
*  experts in a particular domain, we're talking about creative processes. So what we have in
*  this experiment is the distinction between creative processes and creative products,
*  I should say. So the experts, they're the ones who give the most creative products
*  using automatic processes. The novices are the ones who have the creative processes. If you define
*  creativity in terms of the ability to deal with novel situations, this makes an interesting
*  prediction that we could try in other experiments, is that the novices who gave the most creative
*  performances, if they have a general ability to deal with novel situations, they should be good
*  at dealing with other kinds of novel situations that have nothing to do with music. Whereas for
*  the experts, the ones who gave the most creative expert performances, since those are based on
*  a specific domain, specific baked in automatic musical improvisation process, they might not be
*  very good at being creative in other domains besides music. We don't know. It's just a hypothesis.
*  I mean, might this interact with intelligence axes as well? So I know that creativity and
*  intelligence are not perfect, don't perfectly covary, but what you're just saying sounds like
*  novices that are good at handling novel situations may score higher on whatever intelligence.
*  Fluid intelligence, yes. So the whole topic of intelligence research is its own
*  fairly dicey area. Wild West. Yes, definitely it's a Wild West. But there's one type of intelligence
*  that's been isolated through intelligence tests called fluid intelligence, which is the ability
*  to deal with novel situations, but also to deal with, to sort of think on your feet. So if I just,
*  you know, toss an unfamiliar problem in your lap, you have to solve it. You need your fluid
*  intelligence. You can't rely on past experience very much to deal with that problem. That's very
*  much like what we're talking about in terms of the novice creativity. It could be that the
*  relationship between intelligence and creativity has to do with this ability to deal with novel
*  situations. Again, we're getting right to the leading edge and beyond the leading edge of what
*  of the research has been done. But so these are speculations at this point. But the ability to
*  deal with novelty may be what links creativity with intelligence. This is so fun. These topics
*  are so fun. The Wild West is so fun to be in. Before we wrap up the EG, I'd like to add like
*  a little piece there. I don't want to give a sense that this is like an all or nothing phenomenon
*  where, you know, if I'm an expert, I'm only using type one processes. And if I'm a novice, I'm only
*  using type two, because it's really about like, it's about the balance and the function of those
*  processes. So for example, I'll give an example of like an expert. So if I'm playing and let's say
*  that, you know, I play wrong notes or something alerts my attention, something weird is going on.
*  Right. If I am grooving before that, let's say I'm pretty much with like type one processes
*  dominant and I'm kind of like automated and feel like everything's going well. That kind of relates
*  getting to flow that like how that feels, the phenomenology of it. But something goes wrong.
*  You can imagine that now I am I am focused. I am now attending more consciously to the to
*  messing up to screwing up. And I think there's the distinction there. I mean, we haven't tested this
*  yet. But my guess is that there's this ability to cognitively switch where, you know, you know what
*  it feels like with the experience and tap into that phenomenology of past experience of like,
*  OK, this is what it is to be comfortable. And like, here's how like here's like what that is,
*  being able to go up and back between these states, between kind of type one and then kind of going
*  back to and switching to a more laid back kind of less top down control approach. And I would say
*  the same on the same thing on the other side. I've been on both sides. Like as a musician who's new,
*  who's maybe newer to jazz, you can almost feel like you accidentally ended up in a place where
*  you like sound better than you are. Sure. Yeah, I'm sure we've all had those moments, whether if
*  we're lucky, it's when we were performing. But usually it's like when we're practicing in our
*  room and we can't recreate it, but we have other pressures like an audience or other people judging
*  us, which is like an ensemble and social evaluation, all those things. I think the same thing happens
*  there is like and that's again indicative of the flow state, which maybe the next thing we dig into.
*  But like once you become you fall into this into this place where things are going really well and
*  you can play automatically and just like, you know, you're responding to the other sounds around
*  you. And that's this very bottom up. Another way to think about like not having that controlled
*  approach is called bottom up versus top down. Where bottom up is where that's where we're really
*  responding in a more sensory sensory way where we're not kind of evaluating and judging or
*  even planning necessarily the next thing that's going to happen. And then you kind of all of a
*  sudden start to think about how things are going really well. And then as soon as you start to do
*  that, you know, especially for less experienced players that breaks you out of it and you don't
*  know how to get back. Yeah. And so it's really about I think which which types of processes are
*  are dominant between these two groups of musicians, experts and novices rather than trying to think of
*  it as an all or nothing phenomenon. We started talking in the beginning about divergent and
*  convergent processes and in the dual process itself, it's like you have this little stage where
*  let's say you accidentally randomly walk into a place where you realize, oh, this is good,
*  right? So you kind of randomly did that. So that's almost a divergent thinking process, right? And
*  then you realize it's good and that's like a convergent. This is a good solution to wherever
*  I ended up. And then but then it seems to like and there's the network functionality experiments
*  where the default mode network and the executive function network are functionally connected more
*  during creative processes. And it just seems like a very especially in music, a very dynamic
*  switching like you're just talking about how to switch between them. And I don't know how you
*  capture that in for stimulating direct current simulation. You can't capture that the dynamic
*  aspect of it. And with EEG, the timing is better and you can see the power and the oscillations,
*  right? Well, relative to different stages. But then you'd have to like time it really well. I
*  don't know. So I just kind of had that thought of how important dynamics might be and switching
*  between and the rate of switching between how that might be a function of different expertise.
*  I'm sure you've thought about all this. Yeah, I mean, yes, ideally, I mean, we have not done
*  these analyses. And this will be figure hard to figure out how to do these analyses. But
*  we'd like to determine whether these two states are blended or whether they're switched, whether
*  it's a discrete switch back and forth, or whether it's just a gradation of the mixture of the two.
*  If there's a switching, what's the time scale involved? That's all stuff that we'd be very
*  interested to look at in the future. But, you know, what we've done so far, it's a first cut,
*  it's a rough cut to show that these these two types of states exist. And now we have to see
*  whether they are in fact, really discrete states or continuum or I mean, I suspect that to an
*  extent, they're a continuum in the sense that there are degrees of control that a person can exert,
*  or degrees of self awareness, while they're otherwise automatically performing. Yeah.
*  But in some people, that might not be the case. In some people, any degree of exerted self
*  awareness and self control might cause some people to choke. So you know, you find this
*  phenomenon where a could be a baseball player or tennis player, they have a dry streak and you know,
*  the baseball player is striking out a lot or whatever. And then some coaches, oh, no, you're
*  not, you're not swinging just right. You should pay more attention to exactly how you hold the
*  bat or the racket, then they become self aware and self conscious. And then they start choking.
*  And it actually exacerbates the problem and makes the dry streak less longer. And because they're
*  exert exerting too much self consciousness, too much self control when they really, which they
*  should be doing, is just letting their automatic processes take over and do their best that way.
*  That speaks to performance anxiety, I think in almost any domain.
*  Yeah, one of my one of my worst haunting memories, and this is sound, you know,
*  people have had much worse experiences. But I remember, I was in a basketball game in my,
*  you know, middle school or something, I, we were behind, I stole the ball, I got fouled,
*  I made the layup, and I went to the free throw line, they call it an intentional foul,
*  because a guy really karate chuffed me. And I had just seen my grandparents walk into the
*  audience and sit down, you know, and I was really, I could not get them out of my mind.
*  And I missed both free throws. And they were like, they had no spin on the ball. It was like the
*  ugliest shot you'd ever seen. And it still haunts me because I choked. It was performance anxiety.
*  So yeah, it happens to everyone. I have a friend, I have a similar story. I thought I wasn't sure if
*  you're going that route. I have a buddy of mine. He's not he's a musician. He's been in bands with
*  me for years. He's not exactly athletically oriented, let's say. And when you told your story,
*  just reminded me of him. He has a story where, like, he like really had never scored a basket.
*  He was put in the game and he like, ended up with the ball. This isn't enough for his anxiety.
*  He ended up with the ball and he was like, really excited, started running down the court and shot
*  it up. Wrong basket. Wrong basket. Yeah. Yeah. So you mentioned flow states. And,
*  John, you wrote in the Eureka factor, you talk about one of the features of insight moments is
*  that they're accompanied by this joy, right? Oh, I found the solution and it's changed how I have
*  thought about the problem. And people talk about flow states in the same way that that's like the
*  best state you can be in. And I'm at my happiest when I'm rarely, you know, rarely does it happen.
*  But when I realized, oh, I was in flow state, you know, it really is a joyful moment. So how does this
*  relate to flow state? That's a good question. And I can speculate only really. So when an insight
*  happens, an aha moment, an idea pops into your mind all of a sudden. And traditionally or
*  classically, we think of these aha moments as being these discrete ideas or a new way of looking
*  things. But you could think of what happens in expert improvisation as being like that. So you
*  could think of an expert who just sort of turns it on and lets it happen and is just sort of
*  improvising based on these automatic processes. You could think of that as an insight or an aha
*  moment that's extended in time. We don't know for sure whether this is, you know, it's really the
*  same thing. We don't know whether that kind of time extended improvisation is really the same kind
*  of thing as an insight or not. I suspect there's a lot of overlap. And that may be what a flow state
*  is. I mean, we have some research in the works. We haven't published it yet. I'll let Dave talk
*  a little bit about what we've done so far. In a few months, we'll probably have a lot more to say
*  about it. But I think that may be what it is. Dave, do you want to add to this about flow states?
*  Sure. You know, flow is anecdotally, especially in music and in music and sports.
*  A lot of the time, we think that the best moments in our lives are, you know, when we're like kind
*  of relaxing and we're passive. But at the end of the day, when I look back at the things that
*  have had the most meaning, it's when I've worked my ass off at something and really extended
*  what I ever thought was possible or what I could ever kind of like know. And like ultimately,
*  whether that's a musician or whether that's a scientist or whatever your domain, there's
*  tons of opportunities there to, you know, basically immerse yourself in something that like
*  you really care about. Flow is the subjective experience. It's what you experience doing the
*  activity. And right. So talk about things that are hard to quantify. You know, you think if you
*  think if you think creativity is hard, flow is even harder. And then we've we make it a distinction
*  beyond that. And I know in the in the literature about creative flow, because you know, so creative
*  flow is, you know, when you're performing something that ends up, you know, it's it's considered
*  creative. It's not you can be in flow, hike, you know, walking, right? You could be in flow,
*  deeply immersed, reading something. So the creative flow has a slight tweak on that. To me,
*  while you can experience flow when you're when you're performing, there's a lot of there's a
*  lot of external pressures there that, you know, sometimes you'll maybe sometimes other than others,
*  you'll be better at, you know, inhibiting your response to those things. But it's about the
*  ongoing I think you can experience flow the same as if you're practicing scales to a metronome
*  or, you know, even though even in the most mundane tasks, because there's a there's one of the core
*  dimensions of flow and the components, there's there's nine, I'm not going to I'm not going to
*  kind of like list them off about what flow is in terms of how we define it. And the first one that
*  you mentioned is about the challenge and skill balance. And I think that speaks a lot to just
*  the experience of deciding to it has to do with like either a craft or developing like a discipline
*  and a set of going about something that you care about craftsmanship. Yeah, craftsmanship. And it's
*  not just, you know, doing creative things is is nice to you know, you're saying I'm making there's
*  this contribution, here's something new. But I think it's about the day to day evolution of how
*  you you know, and something that is intrinsic meaning that you decide is important to you.
*  And so with with the jazz study, what I've noticed in the in the very few papers that have been
*  published by the neuroscience of flow is the papers that are out there on this work, don't really talk
*  about or don't examine a topic of interest of the participants. Right. So challenge and skill is,
*  as I mentioned, one of the top dimensions and components that people cite as being important
*  to flow. But it's not the only piece. Right. So, you know, a common task that will be used for a
*  flow experiment is like a game of Tetris, for example, or which some people may have different,
*  you know, like some people may prefer more than those. Another common task for flow is math
*  problems, where there is a algorithm or program in place where you set your baseline for how good
*  you are. And basically, it doesn't push you too hard. And it doesn't make it too easy. It's about
*  balancing those things based on what I read about flow and then seeing the neuroscience literature.
*  We wanted to build flow into this study. It's really great to understand the neurological
*  processes. And it's awesome to evaluate products when you're studying creativity.
*  But this goes back to the diversion thinking criticism is that what does it feel like for the
*  person? Are there any psychological constructs that exist out there that would really encompass
*  what this feels like when people are being created? What's the closest thing? And flow
*  is what jumped out at us. So basically just in the initial research, we just in our behavioral
*  model, before we looked at the EEG, the EEG, we focused on expertise and focus on quality.
*  But we just we just built a model to say what other factors will predict how high of a quality
*  improvisation you have. And so there were really two main factors in the EEG study, which we didn't
*  mention before. The first one was expertise and the second one was flow. And the flow states were
*  basically the way we gathered that information was after performers did their takes. They saw
*  the changes back up on the screen. They went through them. They asked how familiar were you
*  with these and how well did you perform and took flow surveys about each of the stimuli.
*  We thought, okay, maybe flow only happens for experts. And so there would be again interaction.
*  But basically flow, regardless of expertise levels, seemed across the board that people
*  were experiencing flow that was leading to improved quality ratings. So that had never
*  really been kind of shown before. And what we're really trying to get a sense of in this new work
*  is we're trying to get a sense of the relationship between how the self evaluates things,
*  how that's related to external observers evaluation, what the picture is there. And then
*  also trying to disentangle really what does flow look like between, you know, again, what is the
*  difference between flow for an expert and flow for a novice? Just like creativity. So that's something
*  we haven't really talked about was there's different kinds of creativity. It goes back to the novice
*  and expert breakdown. They talk about the four kind of four levels of creativity. I could break
*  it down. Like there's, you know, there's like a child who discovers who's finger painting for the
*  first time as like you can be creative finger painting and you have Picasso who's, you know,
*  making, you know, an eminent creation and the kind of there's everything in between. Right. And
*  flow, while you can talk about this creativity, we don't really have an understanding of
*  neuroscientifically how flow is related in terms of the phenomenological experience between those
*  different kind of levels. And so that's what we're trying to kind of get a sense of is
*  disentangling these seemingly overlapping constructs that are hard to define, that are hard to define.
*  So that's, that's work that you're doing right now. That's what's on the docket these days.
*  Yeah, that's what, that's what we're working on right now. We're getting some really cool results
*  so far. Well, so we have, I know that we're up against the clock here, but this is ostensibly
*  a podcast about neuroscience and AI. So I would be amiss not to ask you guys to speculate a little
*  bit. It is hard for me to think of an insightfully thinking robot, right? I mean, does that even make
*  sense to do we have a per enough purchase on this that we could start to build, you know,
*  computational models of creativity of, of, of insight? What would it even mean for an AI agent
*  to have an insight for instance, you know, I can speculate about that. So one way to think of,
*  insight is it's a way to leapfrog across complexity. You could be trying to compute something
*  in a brute force fashion by looking at all the possibilities, say in a chess game,
*  a computer can compute all the possibilities, several moves deep and come up with a,
*  pick the best solution. Insight may be a way to leapfrog that complexity so that you don't have
*  to compute all the possibilities. If that's what insight is, then it behooves us to, to figure out
*  what the computational mechanism is and see if we can implement it in an artificially intelligent
*  system to either enable that artificial intelligence system to compute things more
*  quickly by leapfrogging across irrelevant possibilities or by getting more primitive
*  hardware to behave as if it's more sophisticated hardware to get more bang for the hardware buck.
*  So that, that may be what insight is now creativity more generally though, that's another issue
*  because we as humans call something creative because it seems creative to us. That doesn't
*  mean that it seems creative to a machine. If there were no humans, but there were machines,
*  would there be such a thing as creativity? Maybe not. I mean, I don't think machines would call
*  each other creative. So creativity in a way it's in the eye of the beholder. Sometimes the creative
*  solution is something that works really well. And, and we can point to that objective fact that,
*  oh, that's a creative way to get this test done, to solve this problem or whatever. That's the
*  objective marker, but to call something creative itself in a way, it's a subjective judgment.
*  Now there may be ways to objectify this maybe through by modeling it in a Bayesian fashion. So
*  the creative solution is the solution that is highly improbable given the base rates.
*  It's the most unexpected solution or idea given what is already known. That might be an objective
*  way to define creativity in a way that a machine would understand it and appreciate it perhaps.
*  It has to still be a solution though. It has to still be useful.
*  Yes, right. So, so for example, one of the definitions that some researchers use of
*  creativity is that something has to be novel and useful. Well, the useful part I disagree with,
*  because there are such things as brilliant failures, great ideas that everyone acknowledges
*  are creative, but they just don't pan out. That doesn't make them less creative.
*  So there's two, to machine it, a failure would be a failure probably. I mean, there might be a way
*  to compute non-obvious failures in a meaningful way that would, they could still be labeled as
*  creative. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, we're getting way beyond anything. I mean,
*  I'm not an AI expert by any means, but we're going way beyond anything that I've heard of
*  in the literature at this point. Yeah. I'll piggyback. I agree a lot of what John's
*  just mentioned. I think the approach is, I'm not an AI expert either, but actually at Secret Court,
*  I brought some of these questions to my colleagues at Secret Court who are actually building the
*  artificial intelligence and the neural networks that we use. I think it's kind of a relevant
*  example. And it seems like generally people are tapping into the different stages of creativity
*  in networks. Like in GANs, ultimately, right, there's this ideation and generative network,
*  and then there's discriminative networks that ultimately they're trying to kind of pass off as
*  looking similar to a training set. And so that's basically a similar model in figuring out a game
*  like chess or in some types of math proof examples we've seen where just by coming up with lots of
*  different ideas, ultimately you can train a model then to kind of like whittle it down.
*  That is kind of the approach people are taking. And it seems to be guided by the neuroscience and
*  underlying our understanding of cognition and creativity. But at the same time, the architecture
*  and how people are building and tweaking parameters and like, you know, although we say,
*  now it's AI, it's learning this, there are creative people who are using the tools that
*  are put in front of them to try to uncover maybe solutions that would never be found.
*  But if not for the creative people who are thinking about how to use this tool and apply
*  it in this in this certain way and using their domain skills and potentially, I don't know how
*  they the artificial intelligence to be able to self program at some point. So there's the agent,
*  there's like an agent there with like a focus and a problem that they have conceived of in a
*  problem space. I'll give the I'll talk about kind of secret cord in a way of something of like in
*  terms of our algorithm doper of how we think about like AI being creative. So going back to
*  like familiar surprise in music is like, OK, we see a lot of generative models and things like
*  that are happening out there like style transfer algorithms where, you know, one of our engineers
*  did something really cool. He took the Imperial March and he blended it with with the Star Spangled
*  Banner and made this like brand new music piece. I heard that I was like, oh, this guy's genius
*  has to work here one day. But if you put things into a model like like in terms of doper uses for
*  evaluating and giving insights about the like future value of music by putting in components,
*  things like surprise, you know, because I come into I come into this from the angle of creativity,
*  research or a musician. And so my my initial inclination was to be like, ew, like, no, I don't
*  want I don't want this algorithm in music creation because it's going to just it's going to make
*  things even worse. Like as I learned more and more about about really how artificial intelligence is
*  used in music and beyond, it's really about learning from previous examples and then generating
*  new ones. So the tricky thing, you know, in music, most algorithms are are generating new things that
*  sound familiar to what's happened before, especially in like that in terms of this is
*  dancy, like something gets a tag for a song, like just one word. And you say, OK, give me thousands
*  of songs that sound dancy. And now I can create a song that also sounds dancy. You can create
*  millions of songs that sound dancy. But the question is now saying, OK, well, will any of
*  those produce enjoyment? Are any of those actually good compared to the past? And how do you evaluate
*  that? And so even in our even in our research, we found that if you algorithmically generate
*  like an ideal range of surprise in a feature, let's say harmony, there was a key component
*  we produced. OK, here's X songs with this perfect pattern of chords that has the
*  ideal harmonic surprise according to, you know, past songs. And there's this human component that
*  was required that just because you do something that was surprising doesn't mean that it sounded
*  musical necessarily. And so there was this like this curation process that I see happening across
*  domains where it's useful to come up with different ideas and to do a lot of the brute force work,
*  whether it's making a soundtrack or putting scenes from I just read about putting a movie
*  trailer together based on that Watson was doing based on like kind of previous horror movies.
*  And that was a cool application. And it can save hours and hours of work of just like
*  that, you know, the initial just like putting things together and bringing clips to the front,
*  but then kind of like finalizing that to be something that appeals to other human beings,
*  I think, is a level of insight that the AI doesn't yet have to be able to it might fit certain
*  parameters, but ultimately it's going to generate some examples that are good and some examples that
*  maybe aren't as good. If I could add something here. So I think a lot of this comes down,
*  again, to the distinction between creative products and creative processes. So an AI
*  can produce products that people will consider to be creative, you can, you know, input a bunch of
*  great paintings into a convolutional neural network and get it to come up with a new painting that
*  sort of like the ones that were inputted. So yes, there can be that form of artificial creativity.
*  However, if you think in terms of let's go back to our, our, our jazz study, the EG study,
*  if you think of creativity, in terms of the ability to deal with novel situations,
*  people can do that. That's a lot harder for artificial intelligence that gets to the issue
*  of, you know, sort of the the holy grail of general artificial intelligence that can,
*  can cope with novel situations. That's a real challenge for artificial intelligence,
*  as I understand it. And it's something that people are particularly good at. So I think if
*  you're talking about the creative processes, the ability to deal with novelty, that's more of a
*  challenge for AI than would be the ability to produce creative products in a specific domain,
*  such as jazz or painting or poetry or what have you. So you're so you're saying it's going to be
*  easier to build flow in AI expert AI agents, than it will be to figure out how to teach novice AI
*  agents how to deal with various situations. Well, it will mimic flow, except that these AI
*  agents won't have the conscious experience of flow. So you said so it Yeah, well, I, I don't see any
*  reason to think that they they, they will anytime in the foreseeable future unless someone can build
*  an artificial human brain that has whatever properties enable it to experience consciousness,
*  and emotion and pleasure, emotion, and all of those other things. And for all we know,
*  in terms of the creative process, the ability to deal with novelty, since those in humans tend to
*  be deliberate conscious type two processes, it may be an artificial general intelligence would need
*  to be conscious to do that. We don't know again, this is this is the bleeding edge of what's known
*  here. Go ahead, David, I don't know if you're gonna add something there. I mean, the other piece,
*  it goes along with with consciousness, I feel like the personal experience and emotions that we assign
*  to, you know, different moments and experiences vary greatly by person to person based on what
*  they have dealt with. And ultimately, those emotions play an important role in in the saliency of
*  certain memories. And ultimately, the things that are the most available readily available. And so,
*  by having such a breath of human experience in a physical world, I think, without that
*  access that incorporated into, into like artificial intelligence, that that is quite a distinction
*  from the human experience, of course, which maybe doesn't always play out in things that are very
*  logic based, like a game of chess, but in terms of expanding into novel situations, and, and,
*  and thinking about creativity as as the process, I think that we're quite a bit off from that.
*  Guys, I could I could talk about this all day with you. And thanks. So thanks for going so
*  long with me already. And I wish we had another two hours here. But I wish you both good luck,
*  john with the continued research and, and David, good luck with the company. Do you recommend
*  starting a company to previous academics? Well, it depends. It depends. It depends. It depends
*  what the company is like, I wanted to keep to I wanted to keep being a music neuros. I wanted to
*  keep being a music neuroscience researcher. And I happen to be I have like the background of
*  presenting and speaking about and presenting the company and have like a lot of business people in
*  my life, my father mostly, who taught me kind of how to run an organization and kind of set a work
*  ethic and things like that. And the pieces came together. Now, instead of just doing instead of
*  going to do research, and at the end of the day, you know, I don't really own it. Now we're trying
*  to make something that it's we're pushing the needle, still doing research on the neuroscience
*  music enjoyment, applying for, you know, for grants to continue this research and doing more
*  neuroscience. And so it's really, it's the company that if I if I was someone I was passionate about
*  my research and I got the opportunity to to create a company around that with with people who I loved
*  working with and putting together like a awesome team of just, you know, just individuals who are
*  passionate. I graduated not to make this too long winded, but I graduated from every single person
*  who I said I studied music neuroscience to when I went to grad school, they said, what are you going
*  to do after that? And I said, I have no idea. But getting your Ph.D. probably puts you in a better
*  position to do something. And it ended up that now I'm at this place where now it's a place where
*  hopefully neuroscientists of music and engineers who study music, it's a place where they can come
*  where it's creating a new industry that never existed. John, you're going to drop it all,
*  walk away, start a company? Yeah, sure. Why not? I've thought about it. Sundays more than others,
*  perhaps. Yes, it depends on the weather that day. Yeah. But who knows? You never know. Well,
*  thanks so much, guys. I really appreciate the time. Thank you, Paul. Thanks for having us.
*  Thank you. It was our pleasure.
