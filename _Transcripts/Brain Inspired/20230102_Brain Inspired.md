# BI 157 Sarah Robins: Philosophy of Memory
**Brain Inspired:** [January 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG3xd9hal-k)
*  A lot of the work about memory taxonomies in particular was really coming about at a
*  time when there was great optimism about taking our psychological categories that, you know,
*  the cognitive psychology had done a really good job of making precise and imaging was
*  starting up and we were like, we're just trying to line everything up.
*  I think of it as like really bound up in that optimism that as I see it has come sort of
*  crashing down.
*  So the philosophy of imagination has been an area in philosophy for a lot longer than
*  memory.
*  But I think our understanding of what imagination is or the many different purposes to which
*  it could be put has is sort of all over the place.
*  I mean, I think a lot of the early computer designs are very much based on how we thought
*  memory works.
*  It was a sort of sensible way of thinking about memory of having, you know, like taking
*  everything, giving it an address, storing it and then calling it up by that address.
*  And then here we go.
*  And that kind of view of memory in some respect or another is sort of in the background of
*  a lot of philosophical and theoretical works that people wrote at this time.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Greetings, I am Paul.
*  My guest today is Sarah Robbins.
*  Sarah is a philosopher at the University of Kansas and she's one of a handful of philosophers
*  specializing in memory these days.
*  Much of her work focuses on memory traces, which is roughly the idea that somehow our
*  memories leave a trace in our minds.
*  We discuss memory traces themselves, how they relate to the engram, which Sarah calls a
*  kind of scientized subset of memory traces, one that is more focused on the physical implementation
*  of a memory trace in our brains.
*  We also discuss how memory traces may cross-cut the categories of memory in our current, more
*  or less accepted taxonomy of memory, which divides kinds of memory like episodic memory,
*  implicit memory, semantic memory, declarative and non-declarative memory, and so on.
*  There are challenges to the idea of having a stable engram-like memory trace in our brains.
*  For example, knowing that all of our molecules and synapses are constantly changing and
*  turning over and being recycled, which is often called neural dynamics.
*  So we discuss that.
*  And another challenge called memory consolidation, which refers to the process of transferring
*  our memory traces from an early unstable version to a more stable long-term version in a different
*  part of the brain.
*  If you're into neuroscience, you've probably heard of the recent technology called optogenetics,
*  which allows neuroscientists to use light to precisely activate and record a defined
*  population of neurons.
*  And we talk about how that tool has affected how we think about memory.
*  There's an ongoing debate as well in neuroscience and philosophy and psychology about the distinction
*  between memory and imagination.
*  Are they essentially the same thing?
*  Why or why not?
*  So we discuss that.
*  We also talk about whether memory's function is future-oriented or not, and whether we
*  want to build AI with our kind of often faulty memory, or if it should have perfect memory.
*  So this episode is kind of a tour of many of the current issues in the philosophy of
*  memory, many of which Sarah writes about.
*  By the way, apologies if you're watching.
*  Her video gets slightly grainy for a couple prolonged stretches, so I hope that's not
*  too distracting.
*  I linked to a handful of Sarah's work if you want to dive deeper from what you hear
*  on this episode.

*  Alright, here's Sarah.
*  I didn't know that the philosophy of memory was like a thing, you know, until I came across
*  your chapter and then started diving in more.
*  I mean, there's a philosophy of everything these days, isn't there?
*  Yeah, I think philosophy of memory is sort of proof of concept of that idea.
*  So it wasn't a thing that long ago.
*  In a lot of ways, share your surprise and fascination, pleasantly at least.
*  Yeah, it was a decade ago that I was writing, finishing my dissertation.
*  And at that point, it would have been presumptuous to say that there was a philosophy of memory.
*  There were a few of us starting to do more of that sort of thing.
*  And of course, philosophers have always talked about memory here and there.
*  But in terms of it being an area of philosophy that people outside of doing that work would
*  recognize as a topic, it just really wasn't the case.
*  It's been a very active decade moving in that direction.
*  Okay, so I want to ask you this before we move on.
*  I just had the thought, you know, how philosophers talk about making moves, you know, and then
*  I made that move and I'm making this move.
*  Where did that come from?
*  Like, what is the deal with making a move?
*  It's a great question.
*  I think philosophers really, maybe it's because we don't have labs and we aren't doing, we
*  crave action verbs, I think that especially, you know, physical action verbs that people
*  often talk about, you know, going in directions, making moves.
*  And I do think there has maybe because of the history of the discipline, people lately
*  have tried to move away from a lot of combative metaphors, so making it sound like you're
*  starting doing warlike activities.
*  So maybe moving is less aggressive, but still assertive and physical in a way that, yeah,
*  I don't know.
*  You don't know where it came from, though?
*  Like, how old is it?
*  I don't even I don't even know, you know, how to how I would look that up even.
*  Yeah, it's a great question, because I think it's mostly I don't know that you see it so
*  much in the writing, but you certainly see it in the way that people talk and engage
*  with each other.
*  And yet it wasn't making moves, was he?
*  We certainly was. I don't know that he called.
*  I don't know that he would have called it that.
*  Yeah, that's good. I actually I'll ask around.
*  I think it's so that's so in the in the water of that we swim in that I actually have
*  never really thought about where that came from.
*  So, yeah, because I don't know if I just came across the phrase the other day or what,
*  but it's so vague and like I don't actually really know what it means.
*  You know, it's not a very technical term.
*  So yeah, yeah.
*  So so you mentioned like the philosophy of memory is fairly young.
*  Right. And you were, you know, 10 years ago, were one of the first people really
*  writing about it. Where where is it now?
*  Is it is is it combative in the in amongst philosophers?
*  Is it is everyone nice to each other?
*  What is the state of the philosophy of memory?
*  I think as a community itself, it's a great community of philosophers.
*  So it's been maybe it's because I think it's brought together a lot of people, a lot
*  of people doing philosophy of memory have come from kind of philosophy of mind and
*  science in ways that they want memory to be the topic they're thinking about in that
*  intersection. But there's people that have also come from other areas like epistemology
*  and the history of philosophy and other places.
*  I think maybe they've always felt like outsiders because they were talking about a topic.
*  So it's like we've created a community of people who if one else is like, why do you
*  care about this? And now we're all hanging out together, caring about the same stuff.
*  So in those ways, it's been a really it's a very supportive community.
*  And I think because, yeah, it's newer and those of us who have been involved in starting
*  it are just happy that it exists.
*  We've been not eager to kick anyone out who wants to genuinely contribute.
*  So it's still a bit of an issue convincing some people who are more traditional about
*  philosophy that it is an area that it's kind of an inherently interesting set of topics.
*  But the philosophers have talked about memory for a long time.
*  Those puzzles have been there.
*  It's just kind of giving them a more proper focus.
*  How did you come on to be interested in memory and the philosophy thereof?
*  Yeah, I mean, for me, I mean, it was always interesting, but there wasn't a literature.
*  It was really actually my advisor in grad school, Carl Kraver, who's a philosopher of
*  neuroscience. I was at that stage of dissertation writing where you're very much spinning your
*  wheels, at least in philosophy, that kind of how you're trying to put together this big
*  project. And I really wanted to talk about different levels of explanation between psychology
*  and philosophy and neuroscience.
*  I had this and it was just it was I can see now from the other side of it, it was just
*  way too big of a project and it was just out of control.
*  And he was like, well, you know, why don't you just answer this question about like,
*  let's just focus it a little bit like take a memory trace.
*  Is that a personal or a sub-personal phenomenon?
*  So that was the kind of way I was framing things in terms of that distinction between
*  levels. He was like, you know, go and answer that question.
*  And he was leaving.
*  As I remember it, he was leaving for like a semester in Germany or something.
*  And when he came back, I was like, well, you know, I was supposed to be finishing an entire
*  draft of the dissertation while he was gone.
*  And I was like, well, good news, bad news.
*  Like, I didn't finish the whole thing.
*  I'm only done with Chapter one, the one about the memory trace thing.
*  But now it's like 100 pages long.
*  He was like, I think actually you've just changed your dissertation.
*  I think you're writing about that.
*  So that was sort of, yeah, kind of getting into the top, like realizing like, oh, there's
*  things to say here. And, you know, there's a lot of memory psychology at I was at WashU
*  in St. Louis and so Roddy Roediger and Kathleen McDermott and a bunch of people working
*  on plenty of other memory research as well, whose names I'm suddenly just completely
*  blinking on. But, you know, there was a lot of memory in the air.
*  So as soon as I kind of focused in on that and had taken classes with these people and,
*  you know, been in conversations with them for several years, it was sort of clear to
*  see how you might come to focus on that as a project in and of itself.
*  So that seems like a really cool Ph.D.
*  program. What is it like?
*  What is it? What's the name of it?
*  But it seems very interdisciplinary and a great place to be.
*  Yeah, philosophy, neuroscience and psychology is a PNP.
*  It's a great. Yeah, there's a range of things like it in philosophy.
*  I mean, obviously have particular loyalties and affinities to that one, but it's a really
*  fantastic way of doing that kind of kind of work I've always wanted to do.
*  Should I have Carl on the podcast?
*  You should. He is a good luck getting him to sit still for an hour.
*  But yeah, he's he's fantastic.
*  Yeah. OK. So you mentioned memory traces, and I guess that was what where your
*  dissertation took you.
*  But you've since written about like tons of different topics in the philosophy of
*  memory. So and I could ask about any one, but I'm curious what you're excited about
*  right now. Is there a specific thing that you're working on that you're thinking about
*  all the time that maybe we could start with with that?
*  Yeah, so I'm actually I'm writing a book about memory traces at the moment.
*  That's what I'm sort of in the throes of working and writing about.
*  And in some ways, connections between that and some of the work that you've talked with
*  people on here previously about about the concept of the engram and and what sort of
*  contemporary research about that, sort of how those two things relate to one another.
*  You prefer saying memory traces to engram, right?
*  I do overall.
*  But I think some of that I think they're very related notions.
*  I think they do get used interchangeably.
*  There's reasons to keep them separate for commitments that might come on the engram
*  side that you could have a trace view without having that engram.
*  Some of the commitments that an engram brings along with that.
*  What can you can you spell that out for me a little bit?
*  I thought they were equivalent.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So I guess I mean, so certainly, I think that's a very important point.
*  So certainly the memory trace idea is an older idea.
*  Right. So it's you know, you find versions of appeals to things to memory traces in
*  Aristotle, you find rejections of it and other views of those kinds of times and appeals
*  to it kind of throughout the history of philosophy.
*  But when philosophy was where were the distinction between philosophy and psychology and
*  the kind of natural philosophy of the world wouldn't have been distinguished.
*  So it's an older it's a certainly I think of it as something that people have
*  long talked about when they've talked about memory, but it's never been very precise.
*  I think for for an idea that's had so much staying power, no one sat down and said,
*  here's kind of like it's the essence of what it is.
*  So it's part of why I'm trying to write a book.
*  It's to put something out there like here's what I think we should say it is.
*  And I think without that, the engram is a kind of way of making that idea much more
*  concrete. And so, of course, they're very you might think of it as a kind of proper
*  subset of that memory trace idea that commits you to the idea that it's a physical
*  brain mechanism. Maybe it's about carrying certain kinds of information.
*  So you could have been a philosopher of a different era and thought that minds and bodies
*  were distinct in some kind of way.
*  Maybe you would have thought about the memory trace in a way that wasn't necessarily in
*  the brain or wasn't even necessarily a kind of physical thing.
*  OK, so it's more the engram is more the implementation of the memory trace, like a
*  physical. Yeah, it's OK.
*  Yeah, it's kind of a sometimes I mean, I've said sometimes I think is still what I think
*  that it's a kind of scientized version of a memory.
*  It's kind of that concept taken into that into the kind of contemporary
*  space of neuroscience and biology.
*  How's the book coming along? When is it going to be available?
*  I mean, in some sense, I've been working on it for a long time.
*  It's I'm committed to sharing drafts of chapters with some colleagues
*  for like a workshop, these sessions starting in a couple of months.
*  So that should so it will be shareable with a trustable small
*  set in a couple of months and then hopefully more people, a broader audience, not too
*  long after that. So.
*  So four or five years. No, I'm just.
*  I mean, yeah, I probably want to say, like, of course not.
*  But given the math of how these things work, maybe that's true.
*  Yeah. So, OK, well, let's talk about memory traces because it's, you know, like
*  you sort of alluded to.
*  A trace is kind of a vague notion or term also.
*  And I guess that's why Ngrams scientized it, as you say.
*  What are some alternatives to the idea of a memory trace, like how memory could work?
*  Mm hmm. Yeah.
*  I mean, so I think part of the trick in answering that question is first thinking
*  a little bit more about what a memory trace is, because I think without
*  one of the things I find kind of frustrating in that kind of dialectic to begin
*  with is that the kind of thing you hear people frequently say nowadays
*  in philosophy, but also in psychology and neuroscience is like, well, we know that
*  memory is not a perfect recording of, you know, of one's experience.
*  So we, you know, they might start by saying, like, we know that memories are not
*  perfectly archived in a library in the mind or something like that.
*  And so you get a kind of straw man as a philosopher, but, you know, kind of straw
*  person articulation of what the idea is, a very like caricature of the idea.
*  Like, of course, there's not literal pictures stored in one's head of past
*  experiences. So clearly that view doesn't work.
*  But then, like what the alternative is, is not always well specified.
*  So, so one first thing is to say, like, there might be some ways of articulating
*  what this commitment is that are somewhat less cartoonish than thinking that it's
*  an argument for a video recording or a perfect image in one's head.
*  And so that's sort of part of the goal is to give a more substantive idea of what
*  that that idea might be.
*  And also for philosophers who've written about these kinds of things, you either get
*  the people who say, like, you know, this sort of record archived recording idea is
*  misleading, or you get people who say, like, well, sure, I still feel, you know,
*  of course, there are still traces, but they're distributed.
*  They're not local. Or they say, of course, there's still traces, but they're
*  they don't have content to them.
*  Or of course, there's traces, but they're dispositional, not sort of they're not
*  they don't they're not explicitly represented or something.
*  And those are all interesting alternatives, but they're really different from one
*  another. And you might think, like, if you are there some features that if you got
*  rid of them, it just wouldn't be a trace anymore.
*  Like, we have to I think it's interesting to sort of have an idea of what the kind
*  of concept is, such that we sort of know when you've moved beyond it or not.
*  So, you know, I have a kind of collection of different things philosophers have said.
*  And so it seems like you could have a trace view, but it could be radically, you know,
*  very, very different from something that is also a trace view in terms of which things
*  it supports or doesn't.
*  So what's what's your trace view?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So as I think about it, I think the most profitable way of thinking about it is
*  that traces are the kinds of things that it's an entity that's the explanatory role
*  that it plays, like the function of them, why we think that they exist, why we go
*  looking for them is that we think is in order to explain how we retain specific
*  events or particular past experiences, that the trace is really there to explain a
*  particular kind of retention.
*  Right. The way when I remember, you know, some very specific occurrence or something
*  that's only happened one time.
*  So it's about a way of retaining information that might exist alongside keeping
*  track of general tendencies and trends and broader bits of information.
*  But it's it's about that kind of a commitment.
*  So if that's the right way to think about it, the non-trace views are views that try
*  to explain the entirety of memory or the entirety of cognition without thinking
*  you're going to have those discrete.
*  You know, whether you want to think that the representations are not discrete mental
*  brain states that hold individual events.
*  But a trace is not confined to episodic memory, right?
*  I mean, it can be implicit memory, non-declarative or what is the reach of a trace
*  in the ontology of taxonomy of memory?
*  It's a great question. I mean, so the text that you had sent me that you might ask about
*  taxonomies of memory, I think that they're kind of a mess in that way.
*  And so I think that I think of the idea of specific events or specific, you know,
*  individual experiences or pieces of information learning or something like that as
*  being the kinds of things that could serve traces and that might crosscut
*  classifications. So you might have,
*  depending on how richly you define episodic memory, there are lots of things that we do
*  or encounter only one time that don't meet that criteria because they don't have the kind
*  of phenomenological, the kind of mental time travel aspects to them.
*  I mean, for me, I have like, I think, eight or nine memories that meet that more
*  elaborate requirement that Tulving wants.
*  But a lot of memories are, you know, the information I only acquire, you know, it's just
*  one time that that thing happened or one time where I heard that.
*  And like, I've forgotten a lot of the details, but I remember that thing and that that's
*  what I where I learned it or something like that.
*  And so that could hold true for some forms of implicit memory as well, some kinds of
*  associations. So that kind of, yeah, discrete one shot learning
*  episodes. So it's it's a way of saying that's where the notion has its most proper
*  use is in thinking about retaining information in that way.
*  So episodes would certainly be a central feature of it, but maybe not in the rich sense
*  that how we've thought about episodic memories.
*  So you think that the that our taxonomy of memory is a hot mess?
*  I do. I do think that's a technical term, hot mess.
*  And yes, it is very much a hot mess.
*  Yeah, it's a it's I mean, I was just thinking a few weeks ago about the fact that
*  this kind of standard model that everyone uses, you know, they just we distinguish
*  between declarative and non-declared that we use these terms declarative and
*  non-declared for that, which I went trying to track down, like, where's the first
*  paper that calls it declarative?
*  That's such a strange, you know, like especially because now we study what we
*  think are declarative memories in lots of animals, where we think of them as
*  happening. And so and it does look like it's maybe the kind of holdover of the
*  early cognitive revolution days in psychology and a lot of list and word
*  learning paradigms is where people first start talking about it.
*  I don't know that I haven't found anything where I could say, oh, that's the
*  first use. But that's where you start seeing those in papers on.
*  Yeah. And it does have this kind of behavioral behaviorist tendency to
*  think about it.
*  And so I think that's a very interesting thing.
*  And it does have this kind of behavioral behaviorist tend of, you know, like if
*  you're thinking about the memories, but in terms of like the expression that you
*  see, where you see them and kind of how I mean, episodic memories been thought
*  about over time is complicated.
*  And the whole implicit side of the story is just everything that's over there.
*  Those things are just sort of thrown over there and ignored, I think, by a lot of
*  people doing memory work. And yeah.
*  What do we need, though? Do we need more categories?
*  Do we need a finer grained taxonomy or do they do we need to lessen the
*  individual individuality of the categories because there's blurry lines
*  between them? Do you know what we need?
*  Yeah, it's a it's a great question.
*  I mean, I feel like half of the work or a lot of the work about memory
*  taxonomies in particular was really coming about at a time when there was great
*  optimism about taking our psychological categories that the cognitive psychology
*  had done a really good job of making precise and imaging was starting up.
*  And we were like, we're just trying to line everything up.
*  Right. And so the kind of memory systems view and let's find the
*  neurocognitive systems that support that.
*  I think of it as like really bound up in that optimism.
*  But as I see it has come sort of crashing down more broadly, all of the kind of
*  worries about cognitive ontology and and the ways that there might be massive
*  neural reuse across systems and how we think about those functions.
*  I think there's that worry kind of in the background of that sort of project.
*  But but more broadly, I think that we could have many taxonomies for different
*  purposes. So we could have one that says, let's pay attention to the brain regions
*  that are most centrally involved or the kind of and that might give us one way of
*  saying, like, well, these are maybe all of these are a similar kind of operation,
*  even if they're not. But they're on massively different kinds of content.
*  Right. Or, OK, maybe there's ones that have content features in common or maybe
*  there's ones that come from particular species or others.
*  But the current way of sorting things out does leave out a lot of things.
*  Right. It leaves out a lot of there aren't obvious places in which to put lots of
*  kinds of memory that from everyday life seem like they're important.
*  Like, and I'm going to say this and then I'm going to find out there's a whole
*  literature in these areas I just don't know about.
*  But I mean, like, you know, like memory for like the sort of standard story about
*  episodic memories, memory of episodes and then semantic memories understood as like
*  memory for facts or kind of generalizations.
*  But it's not clear that that has a way of understanding, like the way that we have
*  memories for like people and places and things that we know well that I might have,
*  you know, like a sort of memory of that person, which is over time, just, you know,
*  I've abstracted from all individually.
*  Maybe I remember, of course, I remember some experiences, but I also just remember
*  I remember that I remember my first car.
*  Right. Like maybe I don't remember any particular experiences about where I drove
*  it. You know, I can think about that as a thing in particular.
*  Separate from all that stuff.
*  I'm like, well, where does that fit in the taxonomy?
*  Or and that's just sort of one example of the moment.
*  But yeah, lots of those kinds of things don't have neat spaces to go.
*  But you might think when you're asking people about those, their memories, those are
*  the kinds of things people go to rather centrally.
*  So. Yeah, we don't know.
*  It could be other. It doesn't fit cleanly in the taxonomy.
*  It's like it's an abstraction.
*  It's kind of semantic, but, you know, with the car example, because it's
*  it is factual, but it's also autobiographical.
*  Yeah, I'd have to think about that more.
*  Yeah. And it's got all this it's got imagery.
*  It's got, you know, it's got all this stuff to it.
*  But. Like zooming out, though, like
*  you were talking about the worry about cognitive ontologies.
*  What's your view on that?
*  How have your how have your thoughts been shaped over time
*  regarding the neuroscience to psychology divide or connection or lack thereof?
*  Yeah. Yeah, I guess like I mean, I've always been a little.
*  Hesitant about some of the connections, I mean, this comes up in some of my work
*  more directly, but I mean, I do think there are questions about
*  levels of explanation, sort of how they fit onto and map to one another.
*  So in the I mean, when I was in graduate school and taking
*  Wash U had a standard kind of methods in FMR course
*  that all the grad students that were in the kind of psych neuro space took
*  and the students in my program took as well.
*  And it was a team talk course by, you know, the whole slew of people
*  at Wash U who did the different stages and phases of all the things
*  that go into FMR, which was absolutely fascinating to do.
*  And, you know, there was and that was a good place to be doing it.
*  A lot of optimism about this kind of like we've got these really well defined
*  kind of cognitive phenomena and effects and functions.
*  And we're getting better and better at the kind of task designed to do
*  in a scanner with the right kinds of analyses.
*  And we're lining these things up.
*  And and I remember even at the time being a little frustrated
*  and thinking like, well, suppose my psychological theory
*  says that these are two distinct processes.
*  And you come back to me and you tell me it happens in one brain area.
*  That doesn't obviously tell me that that's wrong.
*  Right. It might tell me that brain area is doing two functions.
*  Right. It might that it's doing two things or, you know,
*  and the reverse could be true.
*  You could have one function and I could find out it's in three
*  or four locations that it's happening.
*  But like, of course, there are ways that these things constrain each other.
*  But in terms of like which direction the inference goes, like, are we using
*  what we know about these functions to figure out what the brain is doing?
*  Are we using it as like a referendum on psychology?
*  I was sort of worried about those questions from the beginning.
*  And people, my colleagues who are, you know, my grad student friends
*  who are in psychology and neuroscience would often roll their eyes like
*  the philosopher is always making this so complicated.
*  But I mean, you know, they took me seriously, but that wasn't their concern.
*  And I feel like the fields more generally, from the scientist's point of view,
*  for for their own reasons and motivations, obviously, is kind of in a similar
*  space now. Those kind of those worries were more peripheral
*  10 or 15 years ago than they are than they are now.
*  And I don't have. Yeah, I don't know that I have.
*  Yeah, well worked out, like views about how it's going to go.
*  I worry about a kind of I mean,
*  I worry about what a bottom up ontology looks like.
*  I think some people have been, you know, like, let the brain
*  tell its own story about what the categories are.
*  Like, I think that might end up being one way to do it.
*  But our ways of examining that have always been guided by what we think
*  the functions are that we're looking for and how we understand those phenomena.
*  So I'm not I'm not sure we'd even know how to interpret that,
*  were we to get it.
*  Yeah, and we have to use words eventually anyway. So.
*  Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You were talking about, you know, the same brain area,
*  maybe having two different functions.
*  And you've written about imagination versus memory
*  because people have an account.
*  So I want to come back to that.
*  But I but I I'm jumping the gun a little bit because I want to talk about traces
*  a little bit more because you focus so much of that in your work.
*  Is optogenetics a like revolution in the idea of studying traces?
*  I think that it is.
*  I mean, that's the only someone you know, I took the classes
*  I had to take in doing the kind of neurobiology cell biology stuff.
*  But that was never my focus.
*  I was much more interested in the psychology and the cognitive neuroscience
*  side of things. And, you know, so the mere fact that I've learned a lot about
*  and I'll write about optogenetics is in its own way, a kind of testimony to me.
*  It's like, OK, you know, I started reading these papers and thought like,
*  oh, I have to go learn this stuff. I have to because it's
*  yeah, it's it's changing, I think, lots of things about how we think about those things.
*  So I'm very excited about it in general
*  as a research program, but also as kind of a stage
*  of asking questions about memory.
*  How has it affected the philosophy of memory?
*  I mean, has it settled questions?
*  Is it opening up new cans of worms?
*  Yeah. I mean, so for the philosophy of memory, you know,
*  as we were talking about earlier, is a pretty new area.
*  And unlike other parts of these sort of ways, we think about the mind
*  that philosophy has been talking about for a while.
*  Those have been other areas have been more hooked up to the science
*  for a while now.
*  There's been a lot of work at the intersection of philosophy and psychology
*  and neuroscience.
*  So memory, because it hadn't been had a lot of catching up to do.
*  So philosophers, the traditional philosophical conception of memory
*  is like it is for a lot, you know, that memories are these things
*  that are stored in your head and you pull them out when you need them
*  and you hit play and there they go.
*  And, you know, philosophers have used appeals to that kind of thing
*  to explain everything from knowledge to personal identity,
*  moral responsibility.
*  Right. I mean, memory is an important thing.
*  And so you have this kind of strong notion of it.
*  So once you have people doing philosophy of memory,
*  it becomes a real concern that like, oh, this is another place
*  where the technical term hot mess applies well.
*  I think like turns out memory is a hot mess.
*  Like, you know, you think you're remembering and you're not.
*  So all of the false memory literature showing, you know, that we can be sort
*  of memory can be systematically manipulated and distorted
*  in ways you can't detect from the first person perspective.
*  That really like so, I guess, like philosophy of memory,
*  if it started by saying, let's pay attention to the science of memory,
*  that's where it had to go.
*  That's where everyone went first, myself included.
*  Like, oh, we got to say something about about that.
*  And so maybe memory isn't what people have always thought that it was.
*  Maybe we should think about it differently.
*  You asked about the optogenetics role.
*  So I guess in that sense, because everything was so dominated
*  by the false memory literature and the study of it in psychology and neuroscience,
*  most of the science to which philosophers of memory
*  have paid attention has been at that level.
*  So optogenetics, part of its kind of basic significance
*  is giving a really strong argument for paying attention to
*  cellular molecular level studies of memory, which, you know, of which
*  there are, of course, decades, if not, you know, at this point,
*  more than a century of work.
*  So that's a huge, huge place.
*  But has optogenetics settled whether there are memory traces,
*  whether there is an engram?
*  I mean, I know I had Tomas Ryan on and I think that he would reply that, yes, it has.
*  But he's a pro engram researcher.
*  Yeah, I'm a huge fan of his work and the work in that area.
*  So I think it certainly has.
*  It's definitely to my mind.
*  Yes, it's settled that question.
*  There are there are traces.
*  I think where the people who don't
*  share my trace enthusiasm would would speak up is that it doesn't, you know,
*  maybe it's only for these very low level memories.
*  Maybe it's, you know, like you're showing them in these cases.
*  You haven't really obviously we're a long ways from human episodic
*  memories of someone's seventh birthday or something like that.
*  And you can grant that, but still think like this is a major step in that direction.
*  One of the things that you write about
*  are arguments against there being memory traces is
*  people who are in favor of a neural dynamics account of memory.
*  Could you just explain what that means and then why you argue that
*  neural dynamics does that not actually pose a threat to the idea of traces?
*  Yeah, so I guess part of why I think it I guess it depends on exactly how the
*  the claim of neural dynamics gets made.
*  And I think on certain ways of making that claim
*  and for certain kinds of trace views, it could cause a problem.
*  So especially if you have something like that sort of straw man conception
*  of like memory traces just are these, you know, video recordings in the head.
*  If you sort of prove like the brain can't hold the brain, can't do that.
*  There's no such thing that could play that role.
*  Then that would be those kinds of views could be deeply challenged by
*  by neural dynamics.
*  But more broadly, from another side, like the sort of I think it's important
*  to articulate exactly what the worry is about what neural dynamics is for memory,
*  because finding out and paying attention to all of the dynamical features
*  of neural activity doesn't change the fact that this is so it feels very similar
*  to the like two psychological processes, one brain reaching kind of worry.
*  Right. Like lots of things we do might be deeply dynamic.
*  And yet, at the experience level, it doesn't feel that way.
*  Right. So the brain is massively dynamic and maybe even perception, too,
*  is a hot mess, but it feels to me like I'm looking at a constant world in front of me.
*  I'm going to see how many times I can use that.
*  I love it. Yeah.
*  Before we get.
*  Right. But it doesn't, you know, the dynamic, the dynamicity of the brain
*  isn't isn't like things can still be stable and feel stable
*  and have a constancy to them in the midst of that at a separate level.
*  So it's I think that is a kind of background thing also to keep in mind.
*  Another point that I always think about when people are worried about neural dynamics
*  for traces is that one of the views that's been when people make trouble for it nowadays,
*  but a prominent thing that people have thought about memory in the brain for a long time
*  involves systems consolidation and the idea that memory traces over time move
*  from the hippocampus to prefrontal cortex.
*  And I like that.
*  If you're fine with a trace like picking up and moving, it's not like you're
*  being housed by entirely different neurons.
*  And that's a view of people, you know, obviously, there are alternative views, too.
*  But lots of people have taken that idea seriously.
*  Then you think that there is there's already built into the field some idea that like
*  the same thing, right, that information can migrate to a new place and yet be a persistent
*  version of this kind of thing.
*  So if that idea is there, then there are ways of thinking about persistence
*  or continuity of information that allow for those kinds of dynamics.
*  It is a challenge. You can't you know, maybe certain kinds of mechanisms aren't
*  compatible with what we learn about certain features of neural dynamics.
*  But you know, whatever you say is, you know, are the mechanisms by which information
*  persists, they better be, you know.
*  Resistant or sort of resilient in the face of those kinds of things.
*  But then you're talking about information and that's not a physical thing, right?
*  So, OK, you have a memory in the hippocampus, it gets consolidated in the cortex.
*  And those are kind of two different traces, I guess you would say.
*  But two different implementations of the same trace, because the traces information
*  set me straight on this.
*  Good. So I think that the trace of that, I mean, clearly it has a physical
*  we think of it as a physical mechanism.
*  I think that's a it's an inescapable feature.
*  But part of how we identify and find that physical neural mechanism
*  is by its informational sensitivity.
*  I mean, that's like over time, you can tell the kind of story of getting
*  to the engram that that Ryan and Jocelyn and others have have found their way
*  to as a story of getting more and more precise tools to say, like,
*  this is these are the cells involved because these are the ones that play the most
*  information sensitive role.
*  So the way that you tell like, is this is this an engram relevant cell or not,
*  or is this an engram relevant process or not, is the role it plays in
*  encoding and retaining that information.
*  So it's a we're certainly looking for a mechanism, but it's a mechanism
*  that carries that information in the right way so that both features are
*  are there from the beginning.
*  And you might think like it's a requirement that it have a physical mechanism,
*  but the physical mechanism can change over time.
*  It might like maybe it migrates from one neuron to the other.
*  Maybe it maybe it moves or maybe it just, you know, updates
*  the way it's held over time or parts of it degrade
*  in ways that may in some ways relate to that information and not.
*  I think these are actual puzzles we have to think about about how we think
*  carrying that information relates to what that mechanism is.
*  So, yeah, they're going to.
*  And I think this is the real puzzle.
*  And it's part of what optogenetics and the suite of tools around it
*  really let us do for the first time.
*  It's like not just watch these things get formed or watch these things
*  when memories are being reactivated, but kind of track them over time.
*  Right. We can we can now image them.
*  We can mess with them when we want to.
*  I think we I'm not doing this. They're doing this.
*  But that lets you kind of keep an eye on these states over time. Right.
*  And from a philosopher's perspective, that lets you ask a lot of questions
*  about, like, well, how do you know you're finding the same thing?
*  One is by finding re identifying that very same mechanism, right?
*  The neurons that you've stained and seeing what happens with them.
*  But another way is whether or not you're eliciting the same behavior
*  or representation that you think is involved.
*  And I think it's going to be an open and very difficult question.
*  What starts to happen as we notice that?
*  Well, the underlying physical mechanism, if we if we're following it
*  and its changes, it might take us here.
*  It might be, you know, but if we follow the information sensitivity,
*  it could take us in a different direction.
*  And sort of how are we going to think about which one really matters?
*  I don't have a good answer to that question, but I'm a philosopher.
*  My job is to pose really tricky questions.
*  And so I'm going to try to pose that question very well and then
*  but the smart people with the tools figure it out.
*  Here's a tricky question, perhaps you can settle.
*  What? What is the boundary of a memory?
*  I guess that you could ask that of any representation in the brain.
*  But, you know, thinking about a trace and the, you know, let's say you have 50 cells,
*  right, that are instantiate this memory trace or something like is is that
*  is there a clear way to think about the boundaries of memory?
*  Yeah, it's a great I mean,
*  I'm not sure what excites me about optogenetics and some of the surrounding
*  stuff is that I think maybe for the first time we can really pose that question
*  and worry about it. Right.
*  So, you know, previously
*  lots of work about the kind of basic mechanisms of different kinds of memory,
*  which involved a kind of implicit commitment to like this particular memory
*  is some of these particular cells.
*  But for the first time, really, we have like now we can actually show you that
*  we can literally count the cells and then we can reactivate it
*  and we can recount them and we can see as those studies find, like,
*  there's very strong overlap, but it's not precise.
*  And I mean, I don't know.
*  So I don't know what will happen as that gets.
*  There's going to be a burden, I think, not just at the mechanism level,
*  but at the content level for how we think about that.
*  Like, so what do you think the content of that memory is?
*  And, you know, what might happen is that we start to explore, like,
*  what would it mean for some of that content to go away or what that content to change?
*  And how does that relate to the underlying changes that we're seeing?
*  We might come up with, like, accounts that better and worse fit that data.
*  It makes sense of that kind of story of what it is that we see.
*  So, yeah, I think part of why I was so excited about optogenetics to begin with
*  is it has that kind of precision that a philosopher wants for these kind of like,
*  oh, my gosh, you can literally see exactly that, you know,
*  you can count the neurons involved here.
*  But of course, once you can do that, you realize, like, well,
*  it's not exactly the ones that we thought we were recruiting or which ones reactivate
*  or how strongly they reactivate does vary over time.
*  So, of course, it's more complicated than that.
*  So for the moment, I'm just focused on the kind of it's a hot mess.
*  You know, it's exciting that we can do it.
*  It's great that we actually get to be worried about that problem,
*  which is, in a way, a new problem.
*  Lately, I've been enamored with process philosophy.
*  I don't know how familiar you are with process
*  philosophical accounts of, you know, various things.
*  But I in preparation for talking with you, I looked up in Dan Nicholson's book
*  Everything Flows to see if there was a chapter on the process philosophy of memory.
*  And I didn't find anything.
*  I didn't do an exhaustive search.
*  But this, you know, approaching it from a process philosophy standpoint,
*  I have not thought clearly about this, but, you know, just marrying that idea
*  with the idea of a memory trace, which seems like a much more stable thing.
*  And then thinking about the neural dynamics account of how everything is constantly
*  being, you know, remade, rebuilt, changed.
*  Everything is constantly in flux. Right.
*  So I don't know if you've thought about that, but I thought I'd just ask you if you had.
*  Yeah, so I don't know the process stuff super.
*  I don't know it well enough to say much of anything, except that I think for a lot of these
*  kind of radical shifting views about cognition and the mind,
*  it feels like memory is often a sticking point.
*  So I know for like a lot of predictive processing views or a lot of kind of
*  massive simulation style views, a lot of views that are which, yeah, again,
*  I don't know the processing stuff as well.
*  But a lot of them come from offloading things onto the environment or operating
*  from very strong kind of general rules you can use, you know, kind of in
*  across a wide range of things.
*  And memory, yeah, it does.
*  It is a kind of sticking point for a lot of these things because it's it's offline.
*  It's it's more static or constant.
*  Why and when it pops out, what good it's doing us sometimes.
*  All of that is is less clear.
*  And so it is.
*  I mean, yeah, it feels like if I wanted to spend my time just picking on other people
*  and other views, I could spend
*  I could spend time just making trouble for like putting memory into some of those frameworks.
*  Maybe, you know, maybe we can switch gears and talk about the relationship
*  between memory and imagination.
*  I don't know. I don't know if it's Daniel Schachter who started this,
*  this constructionist view of memory and kind of equating it with imagination.
*  And I know that you've participated in some debates on this and you've written about it.
*  So our memory and imagination, the same thing.
*  And what the hell is imagination anyway?
*  Great question. So no.
*  And then great question.
*  And I'll find a way to use hot mess again.
*  I don't I think so.
*  The philosophy of imagination has been an area in philosophy
*  for a lot longer than memory.
*  But I think our understanding of what imagination is or the many different
*  purposes to which it could be put has is sort of all over the place.
*  And so already, I think those ways,
*  they're not well suited categories for one another.
*  I think there are big overlaps between memory and imagination
*  in the ways that, like for a lot of imaginative activity,
*  if you think of part of what it is doing is.
*  Generating imagery or creating
*  like in a kind of what I think of as a default sense of what I mean
*  when I say imagination is like I imagine like my six year old does.
*  I'm imagining this kind of superhero I want to put together that has like,
*  you know, different animal features and has different kinds of superpowers.
*  And it's something I've never seen before, but it's built out of elements
*  that I've derived from experience in lots of different ways.
*  That's part of it. And if on that kind of view, which I think is my sort of.
*  You know, background view that I come in with, like, well, memory
*  and imagination are related because memory is like the raw content
*  that imagination uses, it's kind of using the things.
*  Like I take what I remember about, like what different animals can do and look like.
*  And but I put it together in ways I've never seen to create a,
*  you know, mythical superhero.
*  And of some kind. Yeah, this is so I guess part of the debate here is that
*  at least in FMRI, it seems that memory and imagination are
*  constituted by highly overlapping brain areas, at least as measured by
*  oxygenation levels in the brain, which, you know, is not necessarily.
*  But even if you had the exact same area, the resolution
*  with which you can measure activity in the brain using FMRI,
*  I don't know that it would be able to tell you anything conclusive about
*  how it was happening and whether it was exactly the same
*  neurons and brain areas, you know.
*  Exactly. And I think for the
*  you might think that the same brain areas would be activated,
*  even if the story I was telling was true versus the stronger story
*  that they're the same, right?
*  Because if I'm making use of the content of my memory to do the imagining,
*  then it would be in fact like in reading some of those studies.
*  Part of my sort of back, my knee jerk reaction has always been like,
*  like it would have been alarming if we hadn't found that if that result
*  hadn't been found, especially given, especially given the methodology
*  of those studies, which, you know, for reasons that are necessary
*  for doing FMRI work, they're highly similar.
*  You know, they're asking people to generate imaginative scenarios
*  that they've well matched to actual memories.
*  That's going to, you know, that's going to even if these two capacities
*  are more separated, that's going to push them as close together as possible.
*  So so I have some skepticism
*  of sort of skepticism about how much you can infer on the basis of those studies.
*  But also the kind of broader background motivation for those studies.
*  So I think what's led people to
*  articulate this view of this close relationship between memory
*  and imagination is in part because of this perceived need
*  to give a different account of what memory is because of all of the false memory.
*  Work so that has made people really concerned, like, well,
*  the function of memory can't be for remembering because, you know, I like
*  if it were, I wouldn't be so bad at it.
*  And so what is what is memory doing?
*  And so finding its overlap with imagination and thinking about it
*  in those ways, I think is a kind of is thought of as a way to save that project.
*  And for me, I've kind of gotten off the boat
*  sort of long before we get to the actual studies and thinking that that was necessary.
*  So the constructivist view, which you adhere to, right?
*  In some ways, yeah.
*  OK, well, tease that apart for me.
*  So what maybe can you say what the constructivist view is and then
*  and then what you would what your philosopher, you're going to be very nitpicky here.
*  So what a hot mess.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I'll clean up the hot mess a little bit.
*  I'll make a move to clean up the hot mess.
*  I say
*  the the constructivist part of the constructivist claim is just that
*  is this idea that memories are constructed at the time of retrieval.
*  Right. Or that there's something part of it is
*  this rejection of an overly simplistic idea of retrieval is just the act of,
*  you know, going and fetching the memory and, you know,
*  hitting play or turning the light on.
*  This idea that, you know,
*  lots of things can have an effect on how it is you remember a past event.
*  So information you've learned since then, but also, you know,
*  the way I ask you questions, the mood that you're in, probably your blood sugar.
*  Lots of things are going to affect,
*  how it is you actually represent or generate and produce that memory.
*  So it is constructive in that sense.
*  It's not a just, you know,
*  sort of discreet extraction from from a memory store.
*  And I'm fully in support of that.
*  So it's wrong to think that memories are just, you know,
*  that retrieval is kind of like a neutral window.
*  I think it's actually Schachter, someone who articulates the view that way
*  that through which you can just directly probe memory.
*  But some people take the constructivist claim to be
*  to mean that there's nothing that it's entirely a process of constructing
*  from, of course, from from what information, but
*  I mean, it has to come from somewhere. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So that's where I think that's part of what is the basis
*  for having this idea about traces as being a particular way of thinking
*  about what information retention is, because, of course, more radical
*  constructivists don't deny that you retain information from your past experiences.
*  But they think that you do it in ways that are highly generalized or schematic
*  or they're based on.
*  Sort of overall patterns of information
*  and the kinds of things that you could learn in a more generalized way,
*  rather than keeping track of particular pieces of information.
*  So that's the kind that's the sort of difference.
*  So they might think like you have a kind of broad network of, you know,
*  every experience I have in the world adds to my way of understanding the world.
*  But it does so in this way that is, you know, maybe I've got a lot of
*  I've got a lot of Bayesian things set up.
*  So I'm I'm keeping track of what's likely and what's probable
*  across the range of experiences that I have.
*  And so if I have an experience that violates my expectations,
*  that's going to change how I think about what the likelihoods are
*  of the different features that were there co-occurring in different kinds of ways.
*  Right. And so you are going to store information,
*  but just in ways that serve these general updating processes.
*  So then having a memory is just going to be a matter.
*  Or remembering something is just going to be applying those sorts of
*  predictive processes backwards.
*  And so I I build something, I mean, not out of nothing,
*  but not on the basis of some stored information about that event.
*  Is it accepted these days
*  that when you retrieve a memory by the act of retrieving it,
*  whether you're constructing it anew or from, you know, some some register,
*  that it necessarily changes the reconstruction account of memory?
*  I think so. I think that aspect of retrieval is.
*  Largely accepted.
*  I mean, there are still some views in philosophy that try for some.
*  At least, you know, they want some ideas of like in really pure conditions
*  you could have, you know, kind of pure remembering.
*  So I think you might still get some people who want those kinds of things.
*  But I think as a broader, people are much more sensitive to that, that
*  the ways in which, like subsequent information and experience
*  and like what's happening with you now changes the.
*  The nature of that memory.
*  Yeah. You don't think that memory is for the future.
*  I kind of do. I think that memory, you know, talking about the function of memory,
*  what is it for?
*  How could it not be about your ongoing and future behavior?
*  Yeah, I'm probably going to live to regret
*  letting them punch up the title of that.
*  And you know, what is the title?
*  Memory is not for the future, I believe, is the actual title like that.
*  I think it's yeah. Yeah.
*  So it's you know, philosophers need at least seven people to read the book.
*  You know, philosophers need at least seven people to read the things that they write down.
*  So that's one way to maybe we'll get eight out of that.
*  No. So it's sometimes I agree to.
*  But what I what I haven't agreed with is the way that that kind of claim is built
*  into how people think about how that claim is often understood
*  for thinking about this sort of constructive approach.
*  So I do think that memory is for the future and that like
*  the organism is only keeping stuff around in an individual case,
*  but also if we're thinking about it, evolutionary evolutionarily
*  in terms of like things that are either good for it or at least not too costly
*  such that they die out. Right.
*  So at some point it has to pass that kind of threshold.
*  And that has a forward looking feature to it.
*  So memory had to get by in that sort of it had to get by in that framework
*  in one way or another.
*  The part of it that I don't the claim that episodic memory is for the future
*  from some people like Schachter and colleagues who have this sort of strong
*  link between memory and imagination and constructivism view
*  is that they think that that means if it's for the future,
*  then it's not going to retain information from particular past events.
*  Right. That's not what the function is.
*  The system isn't doing that.
*  Instead, the system is keeping track of lots of information.
*  In these more generalized and schematic ways.
*  And then performing lots of simulations about what I know,
*  but what's happening now, what's happening, what could happen tomorrow
*  and when needed about what happened yesterday. Right.
*  And that sort of thought is like, because it's for the future,
*  it doesn't keep track of particular events.
*  And I think so.
*  I'm perfectly happy with saying it's for the future.
*  If that has an influence on how we keep track of information from past events.
*  But that's not that doesn't preclude saying that there are traces.
*  In fact, I think your simulations are only going to work
*  so well unless you actually do have something like that
*  built into the view at some point.
*  If you had maybe this is not a coherent question,
*  but if you had to give up one personally, would you rather give up your memory
*  or your imagination, you know, since they're not the same thing?
*  Yeah.
*  I would definitely rather give up my imagination.
*  I think mine is rather impoverished to begin with, probably.
*  I'm one of those like I was always the like I can't abide a time travel movie.
*  I'm one of those people that like I'm noting the inconsistencies.
*  Science fiction sometimes like he can, you know, he's not falling through the floor,
*  but he can walk through a wall like someone explained it like I'm.
*  Sci-Fi movies are the worst. Yeah.
*  They are. They are. I can't I can't watch them either.
*  Like I can't enjoy them. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah, exactly. I get so hung up on those things.
*  I don't get lost in the stories and the way I'm supposed to.
*  So imagination in that sense, I think I'm already already deficient.
*  So yeah, that's not going to serve you well as a philosopher.
*  Don't you need a good imagination as a philosopher?
*  Oh, so I mean, I think philosophy really takes lots of kinds of people.
*  You've got to have the people with the imaginative big views
*  and the other people that sit around and poke holes.
*  And I think I'm I'm more of that
*  that philosopher saying like, it doesn't work.
*  I don't see how it works. Mm hmm. Yeah. Interesting.
*  So here's another kind of random question.
*  So we've talked about errors in memory and there are different kinds of,
*  you know, errors, but could misremembering things
*  somehow be an important feature of our intelligence or advantageous?
*  Like what is there anything advantageous about misremembering?
*  I think there's a lot that's advantageous about misremembering,
*  in part because you see, as a lot of the studies of it have shown,
*  like with other kinds of memory deficits,
*  things like Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia,
*  you often lose those errors and lose the sensitivity to some of the like
*  the DRM effects, the like list the cases of things where,
*  you know, if I give you a list of related words,
*  so like, you know, pillow blanket alarm, tired melatonin.
*  And then you ask you later about things that are on that list.
*  You'd be much more likely to think that sleep was on that list.
*  Right. Those kinds of effects, those diminish with with like memory disorders.
*  So it looks like there is some correlation between
*  being susceptible to those kinds of things and having a memory
*  that in some sense is working as it should. Right.
*  I mean, and it makes sense.
*  I mean, it's if you're if your goal in life is to perform well
*  in psychology experiments of list learning, then you're not doing very well.
*  But if your goal is to, you know, remember like,
*  of the list of things on your grocery list, like were you trying to make soup
*  or were you trying to bake a cake like that's going to help you in general?
*  It's better to come home with like two additional soup ingredients.
*  If you think you're making soup, even if it's not the exact ones,
*  you can probably make do.
*  Like that serves you well.
*  You know, it's good if you're talking to me about something that I
*  figure out the topic of what you're talking about and think about related things.
*  That's a that's a good thing.
*  Right. I draw connections between my experiences.
*  That's a good thing.
*  So I do think those effects.
*  And I think so, Roddy Radeger in a paper a long time ago,
*  like talked about them in the same way that we talk about perceptual illusions
*  and the kind of like funhouse sort of things like that.
*  Those experiments are really good for showing us,
*  I think, more how our memory works than how it doesn't work.
*  In the sense of like you don't go to the eye doctor
*  after you've been through the house of mirrors
*  because you think that something's wrong with your vision.
*  You've just been in a situation that shows you that exploits those features.
*  And if you think those experiments are well designed to, you know,
*  test the kind of boundaries of your memory capacities,
*  that's really what they're doing.
*  Yeah, I wonder.
*  One of the reasons why I ask is because, for instance, a computer
*  has quote unquote perfect memory because it's just, you know, a physical register,
*  right, that you can then retrieve and it doesn't make mistakes.
*  And, you know, often we on this podcast, we talk about
*  features of, you know, human intelligence and or brains
*  that may or may not be important for building artificial intelligence.
*  And and I don't know.
*  I was going to ask you this earlier, too.
*  I don't know if the concept of computer memory has sort of
*  affected the way that we think of our own memory.
*  And we think in terms of that permanent sort of computer storage.
*  And that's how we should think about our own memories.
*  Do you think that that's the case?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I mean, I think I think that it's gone in a certain way.
*  And maybe this is not entirely.
*  Sometimes I feel like I'm a bit of a lead about certain computer
*  technology metaphors for for memory and cognition.
*  But I mean, I think a lot of the early
*  computer designs are very much based on how we thought memory worked.
*  Right. And at the time, it was a sort of sensible way of thinking about memory,
*  of having, you know, like taking everything, giving it an address,
*  storing it and then calling it up by that address.
*  And then here we go.
*  And so it might have been built by what we thought was a very sensible
*  way of thinking about it. And that kind of view of memory in some respect
*  or another is sort of in the background of a lot of, you know,
*  philosophical and theoretical works that people wrote at those times.
*  And it's only and then, of course, that as a technology and theory,
*  that the computer memory stuff has taken off on its own.
*  Those things have taken off for their own.
*  That's turned out to be incredibly useful.
*  I think useful in part because of how different it is from how we store information.
*  Like we put all the things there that it does so much better than
*  that, those things do so much better than we do.
*  And since then, we've learned a lot about human memory
*  that is really hard to square with that model.
*  So, you know, I mean, for instance, the list effects
*  that I was talking about a minute ago, the the DRM,
*  de Sardegarde McDermott kind of paradigm where you think you remember the word sleep
*  when you hear the list of related words, like that's really hard to understand
*  in the kind of computer model sense. Right.
*  Like if I managed to get to the address,
*  if I managed to get to the memory of that list and extract it, which, you know,
*  like it'd be strange that I get wrong.
*  What's there in the ways that I do?
*  So those kinds of results are hard to fit into that model.
*  And so it seems like that's one.
*  I mean, there's I think other disanalogies.
*  To from that perspective, but, you know,
*  parts of that still seem I mean, there's still parts of those models
*  that seem quite right and that as a Tracy person, it's hard not to give up on.
*  Like there is kind of built into this this idea of like you keep track of things,
*  you know, particular pieces of information and you put them in places.
*  And like, it's hard for me not to think that the opto and Graham stuff
*  is showing like some forms of that are happening at some level for some pieces
*  of some experiences and information.
*  But the overall organization, I think, has got to be has got to be
*  at least a little bit different.
*  Did you just call yourself a Tracy person?
*  I think I did. Yeah.
*  Someone said to me not that long.
*  Someone called it Team Trace not that long ago.
*  I was like, oh, I like that I could make shirts.
*  So yeah, so maybe that's better than Tracy.
*  But so, you know, it just kind of perseverating on this idea a little bit.
*  Would we want to build human like memory in robots?
*  I mean, don't we want perfect memory, artificial agents?
*  Yes, I think you would want them to be.
*  You're either going to want what is what we want out of a lot of our computing
*  systems is that we want them to store a massive piece of information.
*  And when I ask for the thing that's at address 104, I mean, the thing that's
*  at address 104, I don't mean the thing that's, you know, like, I'm going to be
*  very particular about what I want and that's going to allow me to store
*  massive amounts of stuff.
*  So so in that sense, yeah, we don't want those capacities.
*  Yeah, so I think it does raise interesting questions about like whether
*  there is a way for something to have the system we do and do it in like
*  pretty. So could you have a good version?
*  So for things we do have, like episodic memory, like what would be the point
*  or function of doing that?
*  So I have spent a little bit of time collaborating with a couple of computer
*  scientists who've thought about that a little bit.
*  There are plenty of people who've thought about it even more, but it's
*  interesting to me to think about, like, why would you?
*  What's the what could the goal be of that?
*  And it seems like the only thing I've heard that seems like it could be close
*  to being the right kind of thing is that if you were in situations where you
*  were trying to build kind of robot or drone models of things where you're
*  sending them to places that humans aren't going to go and you want them to
*  report back to you, that you might want them to have something like those
*  capacities.
*  Why? What would be the advantage of getting misinformation from your robot on
*  Pluto?
*  Good. So you'd want it to have a working version of that.
*  You'd want it to get that kind of, you know, you'd want it to do episodic memory,
*  but do like the ideal human version that doesn't change or distort over time.
*  And then that's a question of like, is that really human memory?
*  You're trying to build that. Are you trying to build something like, you know,
*  a one off that's actually like, you know, like a human memory?
*  Are you trying to build something like, you know, a one off that's actually, you
*  know, an upgrade?
*  Is there any merit to the idea that that is perhaps a.
*  Way that we are creative by making mistakes and then analyzing the mistakes
*  and somehow, you know, when you join two things that are not alike or whatever,
*  that's one form of creativity.
*  But is creativity related?
*  Do you think at all to misremembering and memory errors?
*  I do think it's related.
*  And I think and I think that's one of the early directions that Schachter
*  and some of the people that now think about memory and imagination is being related.
*  We're trying to go. So there are a couple of papers.
*  I don't know.
*  There's a reason that there's not more, but there are a few papers that show
*  that on certain ways of measuring creativity, you get increased
*  susceptibility to like the DRM effect and other of these false memory effects.
*  Those things are very well correlated to one another.
*  And yes, I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if there is some kind of relationship
*  there that you're kind of putting together lots of different that, you know,
*  that's kind of what you're thinking about.
*  That kind of does require you to sort of take apart
*  whatever memories you have of particular things or be willing to take them apart
*  in certain ways.
*  Is that what confabulation is also that your my mom is the worst confabulator,
*  by the way, and I'm really worried about myself as I age like or how much I'm
*  confabulating, you know, without knowledge of it.
*  Yeah, it's it's scary.
*  I mean, it's scary how those things work.
*  I think that's the way we sell ourselves on this is by saying, like,
*  actually, it's just a sign of how creative I am.
*  Yeah, it's just a terrible side effect.
*  But yeah, I think there's I mean,
*  there are I also think that there are probably individual differences
*  across those kinds of things, and it would maybe make sense that there would be
*  in terms of how much those things happen.
*  So for confabulation, it's so tricky.
*  So I think it can happen in a couple of different ways.
*  I mean, the kinds of ways that confabulation in the more clinical sense
*  where you have this happening in in broader cases of mental disorder,
*  dysfunction, right, like in schizophrenia or something like that,
*  those might be slightly different, kind of like, you know,
*  there might be ways that you're not doing a good job of thinking about it.
*  Doing a good job of.
*  Yeah, thinking about how you generate
*  plausible representations of what you did the other day and and weed them out.
*  But for other people, some of it is sort of could be source
*  monitoring kinds of effects.
*  I mean, that's how you get some of the confabulate,
*  like the Elizabeth Loftus style studies, right?
*  I you ask people lots of questions about some ask them to imagine something.
*  And then over time, you think about this event later
*  and you've thought about it so much that it now feels it has the feeling
*  of a real event and so you sort of misinterpret it as such.
*  And I think, you know, sometimes people tell you stories.
*  I have one of these confabulation things of my brother and I
*  when we were little, we're on a vacation, like boogie boarding in California.
*  And I have this memory that I used to tell of getting pulled out on a day
*  when there were the sort of undercut, you know, the undercurrent and
*  like getting stuck out and people having to come get me and it being very, very scary.
*  And it turns out it happened to my brother and took years.
*  I mean, we were we were little, probably like six and eight at the time
*  or something, maybe slightly younger.
*  And so for years, I thought it happened to me.
*  And it wasn't until, you know, it's not a event my family really talks about for,
*  you know, for any reason.
*  And I had mentioned it and I was like, that was not you.
*  But did you see it? Did you see it happen to your brother or I saw it?
*  I was I saw it. I was right there.
*  I was so worried, especially as the older sibling, for not helping.
*  And I think, I mean, my my memory theorist justification for that is like,
*  I took it so seriously and I probably freaked out and thought,
*  what if that happened to me? Right.
*  And over time, what stuck around was like
*  a very first person image of what it was like for that to happen.
*  And it wasn't until I got to the point of like, well, do you remember people
*  pulling you out and like, well, no, I don't remember that part at all.
*  Like, I have no memory of that.
*  I just have this like, yeah, parts of it seemed very vivid
*  because they're ones that I thought about.
*  And now you can't
*  not remember it that way, probably. Right.
*  You just can you kind of I was going to say imagine, but maybe, you know,
*  you simulate the the thing that's in your mind and then you realize that it's
*  not real. Is that the is that the phenomena? Exactly.
*  Yeah. So it's like it still has all the same stuff to it.
*  But I just like I don't endorse it anymore in the same way. Yeah.
*  My mom, like, will to my like, I'll be in the room.
*  This happens so many times.
*  I can't I can't count the number and she'll make up a story about
*  something about me and it is patently false.
*  And she just does it like as if it's very real and without a hitch in her voice.
*  I it drives me nuts.
*  I love you, mom, but it drives me nuts. You know,
*  is it you specific or is this more it's everybody's other?
*  I'm not I'm not special, but, you know, so.
*  But I don't know how to.
*  There's nothing I can do about it.
*  I stopped calling her out on it because it's like she needs it or something.
*  So I don't know.
*  Yeah, I think I mean, there are people in philosophy
*  who think that a lot of these kinds of processes, they serve some other role.
*  Right. Yeah. That even if you don't think if your aim is,
*  you know, saying true things about the world, this clearly doesn't work.
*  But maybe it is like there are the stories you want to hear.
*  They're entertaining you. They're making sense of things.
*  Yeah, there could be lots of lots of reasons for them that are perfectly,
*  you know, psychologically healthy, at least for the person
*  who's engaged in them, even if they're not, even if they are frustrating.
*  We all have our own truth to tell or something.
*  Is that the yeah, that's very much like that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Who has a better grasp on on memory?
*  Philosophers, neuroscientists, psychologists.
*  Who's winning this this race?
*  That's it.
*  I don't think.
*  I mean, I'd like to think that it should be some kind of joint
*  enterprise of some sort.
*  Who's winning? I don't I mean, I.
*  I'm not ready to call sides in some like I don't know,
*  and I don't know that anyone could or should in those kinds of ways.
*  I'm glad to have philosophers in the conversation now in ways
*  that we weren't for a while, and that like some of the questions
*  about what counts as a memory or doesn't count or where we want to draw the boundaries.
*  I think philosophers can be helpful.
*  I mean, maybe even just especially now, not because philosophy is anything special,
*  but because science, the science is so specialized, right,
*  that you're not just working on memory, but you're working on episodic memory
*  and not just episodic memory, but episodic memory in, you know, corvids
*  and corvids on this side of, you know, with this set of measures.
*  And so you can read incredibly widely and still not at all come anywhere near
*  the primate memory literature or the literature on memory in Drosophila
*  or the memory literature for trauma victims, you know, like in dementia patients.
*  Right. There's it's massive.
*  And so philosophers, by not having to sustain a research program, get to kind of.
*  Look around and talk about similarities and differences
*  and try to put things into conversation.
*  And so I think, yeah, I don't know that anyone's going to win that.
*  I think kind of recognizing that,
*  recognizing that it's bigger than all of us is probably a good first step,
*  especially for I mean, philosophers need that too.
*  And sort of thinking like we don't get to pronounce how things are
*  without actually looking at what the data tell us memory is like. Yeah.
*  Do you see the OK, so my
*  actually before we started recording, I was just asking you like whether I should
*  how I would proceed if I wanted to get into like a philosophy department or something.
*  But and so what I'm about to say may rub you the wrong way.
*  I don't know. But the way that I see philosophy often is sort of.
*  So you're poking you're the type that pokes holes, right?
*  And then you poke one hole and that opens up
*  multiple other places where you can poke holes.
*  And so instead of solving anything, it seems like the questions become
*  more detailed, more nitpicky.
*  And what you want in science and philosophy is to solve problems. Right.
*  But it seems like often philosophy opens up more problems.
*  And I'm wondering how you view that trajectory specifically
*  in the philosophy of memory.
*  Yeah, it's a great question.
*  And so I think I think some I think there are ways of curtailing
*  parts of that question asking process that you know, like
*  you can recognize it going in directions that sort of transcend
*  what we're able to measure, just our limitations we have to take seriously.
*  And that's a lesson I've always taken from doing work alongside scientists
*  at different points. It's like, yes, sometimes you just have to say like, look,
*  this is we want a good definition.
*  We want to well define our measures.
*  We want to well define our criteria.
*  But like once we've done that, we just we're going to stick to it
*  because that's the only way to actually sustain an investigation.
*  And maybe at the end of that, like, you know, it'd be nice if science
*  weren't structured such that like you end up kind of with a lot of sunk costs
*  into like, well, these are the tools we know.
*  And so the retraining or re exploring if that were more rewarded,
*  I think would be helpful for everyone.
*  But, you know, it makes sense to stick with the program
*  for at least long enough to see it through, right, at least long enough
*  to see like what happens if this is the way we conceive of that thing.
*  So I think I think philosophers, it's good for philosophers
*  who do this kind of work to spend enough time with scientists to recognize
*  the different stages and ways in which the poking holes is helpful.
*  And in times at which that actually like is just going to get in the way.
*  And you need to like, you know, maybe phrase that in a different way
*  or wait until we've actually seen what happens from defining it in this way
*  as a way of going forward.
*  So I do think that that's
*  yeah, that can be the philosophy needs to have that kind of
*  if the goal really is to answer the question.
*  I mean, think for some philosophers, the questions are their own. Right.
*  Their own reward. Right.
*  There's merit to that, though, too.
*  I mean, I think that's part of the fun, right, of philosophy
*  is coming up with a good question.
*  But so so so then what's your outlook on the philosophy of memory and,
*  you know, imagination?
*  And you're not going to be out of a career anytime soon, for instance.
*  No. Yeah, no, I think I think this is
*  is really like it's it's in some ways very early days.
*  I think the number of topics that philosophers have picked up on
*  in the kind of memory literature and of course, their debates and views,
*  it's also is just very limited relative to the range of phenomena
*  that are out there to talk about.
*  So there's going to be plenty of that.
*  Yeah. And for the stuff that I've been interested in about traces,
*  because especially because of all of the optogenetics work
*  on engram and such like that.
*  I mean, for me, it's an exciting time because you have a set of scientists
*  who are excited about what these new tools are letting them do
*  in a way that is opening them up, not to the white, not quite to poking holes,
*  but to the fact that they're actually doing it.
*  Not quite to poking holes, but to asking questions in a way that like
*  a certain, you know, in certain places and stages of research projects,
*  that's not where you're at.
*  And so a philosopher is going to be in your way.
*  And right now, somebody who wants to say like, but what is the memory trace?
*  Like, that's not getting me thrown out of conversations
*  in the way it might have a decade ago. Oh, OK. Good. Good.
*  So in your interactions with neuroscientists and psychologists,
*  I mean, is it a pretty friendly interaction or is there skepticism
*  from their side or how do you feel like you fit in there?
*  Yeah, it's tricky.
*  I mean, I think part of it is making the right kinds of space.
*  So these are the kinds of things that
*  philosophers have a different kind of time on our hands and a different kind of
*  the sort of space we have for these kinds of conversations are hard to find,
*  especially because, you know, the kind of professional spaces
*  where you would interact and have a conversation with someone about their work.
*  There's not a lot of those.
*  There have been some and they are usually really welcome, in part
*  because it takes a while to align terminology and align ways of asking
*  questions and and doing that sort of work.
*  My experience has generally been that once you if you build the kind of environment
*  that allows people, kind of gives them the space to have those conversations,
*  they can be incredibly productive.
*  But it's it takes a lot of doing to make that the case.
*  Just because the the the background environments are in kind of
*  practices are so different.
*  Yeah. Sarah, what was the title?
*  What's the working title of the book?
*  Is it memory traces a hot mess?
*  No, it should be.
*  Although now, like, I don't think they let me get away with putting hot mess on the
*  on the cover.
*  And although now it sounds like a dare, and I'm interested.
*  Memories trace. That is the memories trace.
*  Oh, that's nice.
*  Well, continued success and keep up the good work.
*  And let me know when when the book is ready to come out, send it to send it along.
*  And we'll have you back on.
*  If you'd like to come back on.
*  I would love that. Yeah, that would be fantastic.
*  So thanks for this. This has been great.
*  And it's a great resource in general.
