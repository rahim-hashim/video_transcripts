# BI 170 Ali Mohebi: Starting a Research Lab
**Brain Inspired:** [July 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpohK9tI4nk)
*  I want to understand how human intelligence or intelligence or behavior is
*  emerged from activity of bunch of mindless units.
*  Like my job as a scientist now is to find good questions, even if I don't have good answers for them.
*  That this change of mentality took me some time.
*  First year in my postdoc when I joined the lab I was like super bubbly and I was jumping bouncing off the walls.
*  You're still pretty bubbly.
*  Am I? Okay, good.
*  This is Brain Inspired. I'm Paul. Hello everyone.
*  And the first thing I'll say is to turn this episode off immediately if what you're desiring is a show that delves into
*  the science of some researchers work because this is very much another kind of off-brand episode,
*  off-brand for Brain Inspired anyway, because it focuses more on the academic career side.
*  So my guest today is Ali Mohebi.
*  Ali has been on the podcast before on episode 112 with Ben Engelhard where we talked a lot about
*  dopamine functions in the brain.
*  And we do talk a little bit about dopamine because that is what Ali is going to continue to focus on.
*  But mainly we talk about the beginnings of Ali's career as a faculty member running a lab.
*  So he recently got a job as a faculty member and I thought I got wind of this and I thought it might be fun
*  to try to track a faculty member, someone who's running a lab, track them over time,
*  and periodically check in with them.
*  So if everything goes according to plan on a semi-regular basis, they won't be long-form episodes
*  like this, but I might have periodic check-ins with Ali to see if his plans and dreams are working out
*  the way that he has intended them to.
*  So in this episode we talk about his background and how he transitioned from an engineering mindset
*  into a scientific mindset and his future plans.
*  We don't lay out, I mean he has a kind of a five-year plan and he talks about some of the details
*  of how he's thinking and approaching his faculty position, but we don't go into a very, very specific
*  list of his goals.
*  But I found this a very enjoyable conversation.
*  I hope that you do too.
*  Don't worry, I'm not going to be switching to all life story type of episodes.
*  So you can save your hate mail for another time, or you know, send it to me anyway.
*  I always enjoy those.
*  But if you are early in your academic career, for example, hopefully you'll find this episode,
*  and again if all things go well, this kind of series of check-ins over time, hopefully you'll
*  find it beneficial, and Ali's an entertaining guy, so hopefully you'll find it entertaining as well.
*  You can find links to Ali's website, etc. at the show notes at braininspired.co.
*  slash podcast slash 100 170 170 braininspired.co. slash podcast slash 170.
*  Okay, here's Ali.
*  First of all, congratulations.
*  I've said this to you privately before, but a public congratulations to you now.
*  Thank you.
*  What am I congratulating you about?
*  I mean, I guess I got a new job, and that's yeah worthy, or I don't know,
*  that's congratulation worthy, maybe, maybe not.
*  So I will start in next year, I would start a lab and be an assistant professor of psychology
*  in Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.
*  Psychology.
*  Psychology.
*  That's right.
*  Will you be doing psychology or will you be doing neuroscience?
*  Is there a difference?
*  Yes, there's absolutely a difference.
*  I will not do neuroscience.
*  I'm a neuroscientist.
*  I'm a neurobiologist.
*  I'm, I guess, a psychologist as well.
*  I did two years of postdoc in the psych department.
*  I'm also an engineer, but I think I will be doing, I'm interested in behavior.
*  So I will do psychology and I'll use like every tool to study behavior.
*  One of those is neuroscience.
*  Okay.
*  But you're a previous electrical engineer.
*  Previously electrical engineer.
*  Yep.
*  Okay.
*  So let's get into your background just a little bit for people who don't know.
*  So you've been on the podcast before with Ben Engelhard talking about dopamine.
*  I've had the honor.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He got a job shortly after actually we did that podcast.
*  So I could very well be doing this with him as well, but I hope things are well with him.
*  So I know that you were born in Iran and from what I understand,
*  you had options not necessarily to go into research because,
*  or physics because those were dead end paths monetarily.
*  So you went into engineering and then fell in love with biomedical engineering
*  and then found yourself in, I guess, psychology and neuroscience.
*  So, you know, I guess the question is like, how did you come to be interested in what
*  you're interested in?
*  I mean, I thought about this prior to our conversation, just like, yeah,
*  what would be a good answer for you?
*  And I think I can tell you like eight different stories and all of them would be
*  equally valid and invalid.
*  Right?
*  So maybe I'll tell you one story this time and then I'll tell you a totally different story next time.
*  The story here is that, yeah, I wanted to do like,
*  I got interested in biomedical engineering and like back home, I have to, I mean, people
*  are very much encouraged to either go to engineering school or med school.
*  I didn't want to do med school because I hated chemistry.
*  And like, I don't want to do that.
*  So just engineering, yeah, is a better choice for me.
*  And then I picked electrical engineering because I did not have to do a single
*  credit on chemistry.
*  So that was it.
*  I'm teaching my children chemistry right now and I feel your pain.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Exactly.
*  Because like I loved math, I loved physics, I love like literature, but chemistry?
*  No.
*  Why?
*  I mean, I just, I didn't like it.
*  So that was my choice.
*  And then I got a master's degree in biomedical engineering back home in Tehran.
*  And I thought like, I wanted to just become a biomedical engineer and do engineering
*  thingsy and build devices and all that.
*  But at some point I decided not to stay home and leave the country for a number of
*  like sociopolitical reasons perhaps that we can get to or not at some point.
*  And like one way to leave the country for me was to get into grad school.
*  And I like the only way, like I couldn't get into like a chemistry program
*  because I hated chemistry.
*  I didn't have any background in neuroscience or anything like that.
*  So I applied to an engineering program.
*  I get into an engineering PhD program in Michigan State and I left the country.
*  I don't know.
*  So the decision to go to graduate school was a function of wanting to leave the country?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Okay.
*  I mean, that's one story that is valid.
*  Okay.
*  Equally be like just made up.
*  I mean, it's post-hoc.
*  But there's a bit of truth to that.
*  So yeah, I mean, that was my decision to be like fully honest.
*  That was I didn't want to do.
*  I wanted to get an MBA degree and get into the world of business of biomedical engineering
*  devices.
*  That was my choice.
*  Okay.
*  But that didn't happen.
*  Well, so when I read your bio on your website,
*  that story is that you ended up going to a talk that you fell in love with.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So I'll tell you that story.
*  Let's do that.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, one day in Michigan State, there was a talk that I saw the title.
*  Now I forgot.
*  It seemed like something I could have been interested in.
*  I went to and Josh Burke, my current boss and future post-hoc advisor was giving a lecture.
*  And I really liked both the stuff that he was talking about and his presentation style,
*  the figures and things that he showed.
*  I'm like, I want to be an author on one of those papers.
*  I want to be first author with this guy on one of these papers.
*  Because my interest in electrical engineering was not as strong.
*  I thought maybe I'll just drop out.
*  I've done like three years of PhD in electrical engineering.
*  How about if I just drop out and start fresh and do a psych degree or neuroscience or something
*  like that?
*  So I sent Josh an email and got an appointment, went to his office, which was like an hour drive.
*  And I told him that, like, Josh, I like what you do and I want to do this stuff and not my stuff.
*  How about if I drop out and reapply next year to your program?
*  He's like, I mean, you're three and a half years in.
*  How about you just finish and then come do postdoc with me?
*  But I mean, that's what happened.
*  I finished my PhD.
*  I got a degree in electrical engineering and then I went on to do postdoc with them.
*  I didn't do like postdoc interviews elsewhere.
*  I'm like, yep, this guy, I want to work together.
*  Like to this day, I don't know if it was a good decision or not.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, because like, yeah, but.
*  Because three and a half years in, like the first few years of a PhD,
*  it's not like they're linear, right?
*  So the last couple of years are like six years.
*  The last two years of a PhD are like the six years or something.
*  Whereas the first few years are normal.
*  Yeah, normal like coursework.
*  So I didn't get to have like a cohort in psychology or neuroscience or anything like that.
*  But I have friends now.
*  I go to conferences and I have friends.
*  So I don't know.
*  I mean, maybe it doesn't matter as much that I didn't have my
*  I didn't get to have my neuroscience cohort because I have friends now.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll go to conferences just to see them.
*  I mean, I go for science as well, but I go to conferences to hang out with my friends.
*  So OK, so you've kind of transitioned from a.
*  I would I don't know, industry kind of mindset towards the beginning.
*  OK, and now you're fully academia.
*  I'm fully academia.
*  I mean, I knew at some point that I wanted to be.
*  I mean, I guess I always had interest, like deep
*  if I may say philosophical interest or like I was always interested in the why kind of questions.
*  But I also had this part of me that love to build things that I still do it.
*  I build my own rig.
*  I write my own like control programs to do things.
*  And I think moving forward in the future when I open my lab and start doing all these things,
*  at some point I will stop doing experiments because I mean,
*  I will not be able to do these like surgeries, et cetera.
*  But one part I don't want to ever not do is stop building.
*  I want to keep building things, building like rigs and pushing technology a bit forward.
*  So that's one thing I would always do.
*  So, yeah, I mean, I had that part in me as well.
*  But I guess the neuroscience questions or behavioral neuroscience questions were important
*  to me as well.
*  But that's maybe another valid story that why I'm interested in that kind of stuff maybe for next.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  For next up.
*  Yeah.
*  The idea is that we're going to keep revisiting you to see your little your career arc and your
*  feelings along the way.
*  How are you feeling right now?
*  Anticipating.
*  So you're going to be starting in what next year, right?
*  In the fall center.
*  All of next year.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  So there's excitement.
*  There's is there trepidation?
*  Is there anxiety?
*  What's your current outlook?
*  Yeah, there's all of all the above.
*  I mean, there's excitement for sure.
*  There's a bit of anxiety because I mean, it's a job I've never been trained for.
*  I mean, many aspects of the job I've never had training for it.
*  And in fact, the reason I deferred my appointment for one year, I mean, typically, if you apply
*  in twenty three, you start in the fall of twenty four.
*  But I pushed it back for sorry, fall of twenty three.
*  Yeah.
*  Shit.
*  Oh, God.
*  I applied in twenty two.
*  Yes.
*  In a decade, I will begin my lab.
*  Right.
*  God.
*  OK.
*  Yes, I applied in twenty two.
*  That's right.
*  In November of twenty two ish, I applied.
*  So I mean, the idea is that you start in fall of twenty three, but I deferred my appointment
*  by one year to start in twenty four.
*  And I call it my sabbatical year.
*  But you know, it's typical when you get an appointment as a professor, you like every
*  six years, you'll get a year off to just reconvene and learn new things and think about
*  what you're going to do in the next five, six years.
*  Like, I guess I'm lucky to have that sabbatical on my year zero.
*  So I want to spend some time to learn what to do, how to do, think about like get training,
*  go to workshops on like academic management, on teaching and things like that.
*  Because I know that's I guess that would help me reduce my anxiety and then be prepared
*  a bit for the job that I'm going to do.
*  I guess it's a privilege.
*  I think it's a privilege that I'm in this situation where I can spend this year.
*  Soterios That is a privilege.
*  I mean, everyone that I've seen, you know, when you get just kind of thrown into the
*  fire without the skills that are necessary for the job that you're supposed to do.
*  Yeah.
*  People are sweating and running through the buildings and yeah, just overwhelmed.
*  Right.
*  And I mean, I'm in this NAMH training fellowship.
*  That would allow me, I mean, it's designed for like a career transition that would allow
*  me to spend this time and I'm encouraged to spend this time to prepare for my future job.
*  Yeah.
*  And like there's always lab renovation that has to be done.
*  I didn't want to move before the space is ready.
*  And I know I've been around long enough to know that
*  your space will be ready by the time you're in will mean that it will be ready year after.
*  Soterios Yeah, I had an idea for a business.
*  It's like a consumer reports kind of business that for any construction jobs that the estimation
*  of time and money is always short of, you know, what like, but that's the case for academic
*  pursuits as well.
*  And research pursuits, we always underestimate how long things are going to take.
*  Soterios Yes, yes, we underestimate, which is
*  Soterios We're optimistic.
*  Soterios Yeah, we have hope and dreams.
*  So I guess it's
*  Soterios So hopes and dreams.
*  Do you have a grand vision and a sort of timeline of how you see things unfolding and
*  questions being answered in your career?
*  Soterios Yeah, in the first five years, at least.
*  I mean, if had you asked me this when I applied for jobs, which was, I don't know, in September,
*  October, I had a like, better answer.
*  But after chat GPT, I don't know.
*  I mean, all my estimates, when I applied, there was no chat GPT.
*  Soterios What difference does that make?
*  Soterios I mean, it changes everything, I think.
*  I mean, it changes my approach to neuroscience.
*  I mean, I'm going to spend a year thinking about like, we'll get to it, maybe a bit later.
*  But I'm like, it's a tool, I think, for neuroscientists as well in studying behavior,
*  right?
*  I mean, what is the idea?
*  What am I doing here?
*  I want to understand how human intelligence or intelligence or behavior is
*  emerged from activity of bunch of mindless units, right?
*  We call neurons or channels, ion channels, whatever, right?
*  I mean, these could be your nodes in a network.
*  And if it's now showing some activity, right, my job here as a neuroscientist, I think,
*  is to decode the brain in the sense that what algorithm is the brain using to produce this
*  behavior, right?
*  So much as I know, like these large language models, I mean, I'm not an expert, but I mean,
*  they're just the algorithm they're trained with is like quite simple.
*  Minimize an objective function, look at the data and minimize the difference between your
*  produced results and whatever you were trained on, right?
*  So there's no specific algorithm for understanding or comprehension, text comprehension, etc.
*  But how is it doing that?
*  So now I'm thinking, can we just...
*  So isn't this what we're doing in neuroscience after all, that we're trying to find out what
*  algorithms these mindless units in the brain are using?
*  So maybe one way we can do neuroscience, we can use our tools, our ideas to study how these
*  networks produce the behavior.
*  So I'm now really thinking that I'm not interested in neurons per se, right?
*  I'm not a neurologist or neurobiologist.
*  I mean, I'm trained as a neurobiologist, but my goal is not to fix the brain.
*  I mean, if your goal is to find a cure to Parkinson's disease, then you need to know
*  your neurons, right?
*  I mean, the computer analogy that like, do I need to understand the transistor if my
*  job is to find out how your code works?
*  I mean, not really, but if my computer is broken, I may need to understand how transistors
*  work or how different parts of the machine work to put it back together and fix it.
*  So someone who's doing translational neuroscience is really interested in how neurons work.
*  I'm not as interested.
*  I still study them, but in the context of how they encode information and how they
*  collaboratively help us guide in this universe.
*  But as someone who's interested in behavior primarily, I know that you're
*  interested in a lot of other things as well.
*  But I mean, has the like chat GPT, has it changed the way that you think about behavior?
*  And it's you're like sort of zooming out.
*  You're like overall overview of behavior, right?
*  Like that we're going to figure out what you've wanted to figure out about behavior,
*  how it comes about.
*  It is much as you can call what chap GPT does behavior, quote unquote.
*  I mean, has it changed the way that you view like your own questions and outlook on it?
*  I mean, it is, I think, starting to change.
*  I don't have like concrete thoughts yet about it.
*  I'm still trying to figure out and understand it better.
*  But I think it has changed a bit and it will keep changing it.
*  I mean, how I define behavior, what aspects of behavior, what am I interested in?
*  Holding onto a conversation is working memory, basically.
*  And my first plan in the lab is to study working memory.
*  And the big project and I have specific goals and how to study what aspects of it to study.
*  But I guess part of it is like holding onto a conversation and chat GPT seems to be able to
*  do that to some extent.
*  Yeah, how would you?
*  Right.
*  And a network, like how would network dynamics maintain some information, some context information?
*  Well, on a computer, it's easy.
*  Memory is easy.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But is this memory or not?
*  Right.
*  I don't know.
*  So, right.
*  This is something that I don't know.
*  Maybe I'm reading.
*  I have to read more.
*  But is it like very discrete memory that is explicitly encoded or is it
*  maintained through some network dynamics?
*  Right.
*  Because yeah, it's boring.
*  If you just keep everything in a memory stack.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's boring.
*  But from what I feel is that it's not.
*  Your conversation with chat GPT seems to be able to tip the network to some space in the state,
*  space that would like, yeah, maintain this memory.
*  It seems like very similar to what people have been doing.
*  So you've been playing with having conversations with, I guess, as everyone else has.
*  Yeah, right.
*  What do you use it for?
*  I mean, I use it for like writing codes these days.
*  It's great.
*  It helps me.
*  I mean, maybe not first attempt.
*  It has some bugs and things.
*  But I mean, if I'm writing a function to do something,
*  I mean, I don't have to spend an hour writing that and testing it.
*  I'll ask chat GPT write it for me and then I'll just supervise it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's I think my main use these days.
*  Okay.
*  But let's go back to how you think it's changed everything.
*  Like you changed like how so in terms of like what you're asking and what your research.
*  That's right.
*  So I guess like chat GPT and maybe deep learning in general, right?
*  Two effects and neuroscience.
*  I think one is like tool development.
*  Now we have better tools thanks to all these AI systems.
*  Yeah.
*  We have like deep lab cut that previously we had to sit there and score videos for
*  tracking animal position and amaze.
*  Now we don't have to do that.
*  I know.
*  It's like embarrassing.
*  Recent history is kind of embarrassing.
*  I refuse to do that because it was just so demeaning.
*  I mean, it was the only thing to do, but I refuse to do it.
*  I designed my experiments so that I didn't have to do that.
*  I was going to study like whisker movement at some point and like this was like many years back
*  where like these tools were not as advanced and it seems so just demeaning to sit there
*  and do these.
*  So I decided not to do that project.
*  But so yeah, I mean, one thing is that it helps us do it's giving us better tools, right?
*  Like writing codes, for example, right?
*  I don't have to spend my time because I'm not a software engineer.
*  I don't have to spend that time doing that and I can spend it in other ways.
*  But I think beyond that, it makes me think more about behavior and what is behavior
*  and how you can use tools that we currently use in neuroscience to get from collective to decode
*  algorithms from collective activity of some nodes in the network.
*  Okay, I know that.
*  I mean, these networks are not like spiking networks, most of them, right?
*  But I think like some of the tools that we have developed over the years may help us,
*  may be able to help us decode these algorithms.
*  And if so, I mean, this is like we can treat it like a brain, right?
*  Where we now have access to every single neuron as opposed to recording from like,
*  I don't know, 50, 200, a thousand out of a billion, right?
*  So I think one of the things that it has done because I guess everyone is reflecting on what
*  does this mean about how I think about intelligence and behavior?
*  And for me, that's always an open question because I have no answers.
*  But it really hammers home the vast variety of multiple realizability.
*  And I don't think that these transformers are the end all, right?
*  I don't think that they're intelligence.
*  But it does really hammer home that there are lots of different ways to skin a cat,
*  I suppose, is the old adage that we don't use anymore.
*  We should not.
*  Yeah. So is that part of what you're thinking as well?
*  Like, yeah, I agree.
*  So yeah, I don't think they're intelligent, but they seem to be capable of producing
*  some aspects of intelligent behavior, right?
*  So and that's what I'm interested in to like figure out.
*  And I think we can use them as study subjects.
*  So far, I've been studying rodents mostly for neuroscience, but I think I may want to have
*  another research program developed to study these as agents of intelligent behavior as well.
*  But that's going to be a crowded road, right?
*  I think a lot of people thinking that same thing like, oh, I will study transformers.
*  It won't be as crowded as dopamine field, I guess.
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah. I mean, of course.
*  Yeah, I'll be part of the crowd.
*  It's good to have like group efforts.
*  Yeah, but absolutely.
*  But I think each scientist would, I mean, part of what we try to do is we want to craft
*  our own way of looking at things and combining things.
*  And I think I will have this unique opportunity and these like tool sets and skill sets that I
*  want to keep studying rodent behavior as well.
*  And I want to study their brain.
*  But as an additional subject, maybe at some point I'll study these artificial agents too.
*  One of the reasons why I wanted to do this with you is very selfish,
*  because when I think of my own path, so I'm going to ask you a question that I wouldn't
*  want anyone to ask of me because I don't have a good answer for it, which is like how your
*  views and relationship, I guess, with science and thinking about what science is and engaging
*  with it, how that's sort of changed over the years for you, because it's a really
*  hard question for me to even approach an answer to.
*  And I feel like I would just ramble on without saying anything.
*  Yeah, I think maybe I can have some meaningful thought about that because
*  I was not trained as a scientist until like late or like until after grad school.
*  I was trained as an engineer.
*  And these are two different philosophies, I would say.
*  So like I got to learn how to be a scientist from Josh and interaction with people in his lab,
*  at schools, etc.
*  In my very adulthood.
*  So like an engineer, I mean, the big difference between an engineer and a scientist,
*  I would say that if you're an engineer, you are amazing at solving problems, right?
*  You're a contractor.
*  Well enough.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  Yeah, right.
*  It's a caveat.
*  Yeah, right.
*  I mean, yeah, if you're a good engineer, if you're an amazing engineer, you're amazing
*  at solving problems, right?
*  I mean, you're a contractor, someone shows up with a problem and will ask you,
*  can you solve this for me?
*  But you're amazing at solving the problem at twice the cost that you estimate and twice
*  the time.
*  Yes, you're not a good manager necessarily, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's what happens when you put nerds on management positions.
*  I mean, we get Silicon Valley, I guess.
*  But that's a separate conversation for another time.
*  But you're not very good at asking questions.
*  And I think a good scientist, I mean, this took me some time to realize that, like my
*  job as a scientist now is to find good questions, even if I don't have good answers for them.
*  That this change in mentality took me some time.
*  I showed up as an engineer and I'm like, I'm this happy bubbly guy.
*  I want to just code up things and build things and put these probes in the brain
*  and do these measurements.
*  And Josh is like, but why?
*  What's the question?
*  What are you trying to show?
*  And then I'm like, I don't know.
*  It's cool, isn't it?
*  I mean, look, I can double the channel count.
*  And I can use these cool new digital systems.
*  You don't have to use analog amplifiers for your EFAs anymore.
*  He's like, yeah, sure.
*  But what is the point now?
*  Tell me what is the question you're going to ask?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, we'll just...
*  I'll just do whatever everyone seems to be doing, stamp collection.
*  I'll just go there and...
*  Record from a bunch of cells and then try to craft a story.
*  Okay, so you're touching on something that I've observed.
*  David Popol comes to mind because lots of people come to mind actually who preach that
*  at an early stage of your career, you need to be asking these sorts of questions.
*  So in the beginning, you kind of do what everyone else is doing and it's cool and you do it because
*  it's cool and you can...
*  The question is kind of already set, especially when you're being advised by someone often.
*  And then it seems like later, I don't know what stage it is later in people's careers,
*  then they start asking the meta questions and realizing, oh, well, we don't actually know
*  what we're asking or why we're asking it.
*  And that's when you start digging down and that seems to be happening to you right now.
*  Are you going to start preaching to people coming into science that they need to
*  start developing that sense immediately? And if so, why would that be?
*  Yeah. So I think there are things you need to learn. You need to learn some skill sets.
*  That's something you have to learn. And this would be different for grad students versus
*  postdoc. Different stages of your training, I think, would be different.
*  For postdocs in my future lab, I want them to be asking questions. I mean, maybe first year or two,
*  it's okay to answer questions that I have in mind. But after year two, I want them to be working on
*  their own questions, something that they can seal and take it with them. Because we don't have much
*  time to just walk around with tools and experiments. I mean, it's cool to learn
*  new things always. I mean, I'm learning new techniques still. I mean, after being
*  postdoc for eight years now, God, it's been long. And we can talk about that as well at some point.
*  But I'm still learning. I mean, there's always new things to learn, new cool techniques to learn.
*  But I think it's important to develop your own questions because that's what science is.
*  But can't you get bogged down in the question? And so,
*  okay, so you ask a good question, right? And then you think, well, how would I answer that?
*  But then I guess that's philosophy, right? Because then you can just ask another
*  question and ask another question and not end up not doing anything paralysis by analysis.
*  Right. But I think, yeah, then science, I would say, would be the art of, I mean,
*  that's the difference between a scientist and a philosopher, right? A scientist should be able to
*  break it down, break down those meta questions to smaller achievable units that then you can
*  ask yourself. Like, yeah, I cannot. I mean, okay, another valuable story or valid story of me
*  going into neuroscience was like free will and consciousness. I wanted to know.
*  Of course. Of course, right? Why wouldn't you?
*  I want to know. I need the answer for that free will, right? But how would you do that
*  experimentally? I think a scientist would be interested in breaking it down or reducing.
*  Scientists are very good. I mean, I guess the science has been good at reduction. I mean,
*  hmm, can reduce that like huge meta question to something more tangible.
*  But something like free will, and we don't have to talk about free will specifically,
*  you know, the Libet experiments. So you reduce it, you do an experiment. But then the notion
*  of free will itself is just so slippery that you can interpret it, interpret the results of an
*  experiment in such a way that you end up redefining what free will is. And then you're
*  not actually answering any questions necessarily. You're getting data.
*  You're getting some data that would help you better understand it and then may help others
*  better understand it in the future would help. I mean, you had a show a few weeks back about
*  like memory and how optogenetics has changed or has helped philosophers understand, I mean,
*  how memory is encoded and engrams and all that. So I guess you make some progress that then
*  some people who are more interested in the meta question can use your evidence to come up with
*  better working models of these big concepts. Do you think that, so again, this is like
*  really selfish of me. So I'm glad that you decided to have this conversation with me. But
*  do you think that you're, I know you're humble, so you're not going to answer this well.
*  Do you think that you're kind of ahead of the curve in terms of people getting
*  scientific research, academic positions with your philosophy and going into, you know,
*  for running a lab and for asking questions and tackling questions?
*  Yeah, I mean, maybe. And the reason would be that I spent so many years doing a postdoc.
*  I think, I mean, had I started my lab in year three or four of my postdoc, I would have been more,
*  maybe I wouldn't use the word ambitious for it. I wouldn't be more like pragmatic. I wanted to
*  publish in big journals and get the fancy flashiest. But I think it's part of aging as
*  well that calmed me down, that changed my priorities. How old are you?
*  I am 38 now. So I started postdoc when I was 38 years gone. I mean, it was pandemic, I guess,
*  to be honest. I wanted to be out in 2019, but then pandemic happened and jobs and everything. Just,
*  yeah, life. But I think what helped me realize is that, I mean, I lost that hunger for
*  publishing in best journals and flashiest data and everything. I started thinking more about
*  the why question. What are we exactly doing? Part of it is that I'm getting paid by
*  taxpayers to study something that is useful for human beings. So it's very selfish and irresponsible.
*  If I funnel that fund to publish something flashy just to get famous, and it's like a dumb way of
*  being famous because this fame is super local and is limited to, I don't know, I mean,
*  you would be famous among 200 people. Not worth it. Not worth spending my life that way. I would
*  become a rock star if I wanted to do that. But there are benefits of being a rock star.
*  You could sell out and then use that to 10x your productivity on what you actually want to do.
*  Hmm. Yeah. Is that so? Or by that point, you become that villain, right? That you would be
*  chasing that fame. I guess one of the advices I got, I mean, I'm going around now and I will
*  go around ask for advice from people who I trust and how to run a successful lab. One of the things
*  that I got was that you should know what you want and not let other things distract you. If your goal
*  is to become famous, focus on that. You don't have to do good science if your goal is that.
*  If your goal is to publish in top journals, that's your goal. If your goal is to win awards,
*  that's your goal. Sit there. And if your goal is to do good science, then you should not care
*  whether or not you're getting awards because if you do that, you will become very bitter and
*  resentful. What proportion of academics do you think are primarily concerned with legacy?
*  Good fraction, I would say. They're successful. Those are the super six, at least in the eyes of
*  publication records and invitations and keynotes. I'm not trying to badmouth anyone.
*  It's a valid thing that when I was a postdoc and thinking about, well, should I get a faculty
*  position? These sorts of questions drove me away from it because I wanted to be honest with myself
*  about aspirations and why someone would write a grant and for what reason. It's kind of just
*  to keep myself going instead of doing something honest. Exactly. If you become a grant writing
*  machine, if that's your goal to have five R1s and run a big lab with 30 postdocs, that's your goal.
*  Good for you. But if that's not your goal, don't let that distract you or don't let that make you
*  resentful. If that makes any sense. There's some correlation between success with those measures
*  and good science, but it's not 100%. It would happen that you see that someone in your field
*  of study would win an award that you think you are worthier than them winning that award.
*  And then if you set your goal to win awards, that's good for you. But if not, that would hurt you.
*  I deserve that award more than they did. Why did I not get it? And then that would distract you from
*  doing your goal. If that's not your goal, you should not be bothered by that at all. If that
*  makes any sense. If you feel that you're happy with having a small size lab, having two grad
*  students, one postdoc, one lab manager, and work as a small team, you don't need five grants.
*  Because if you get five grants, then you need to maintain that. If that's your goal, if you want to
*  be managing a big lab, great. That's your goal. That's not mine. I mean, I decided that's not mine,
*  and I will not, at least for the next decade, that's not my goal. And I will not let, yeah.
*  So part of the reason why I wanted to do this is we're going to periodically check in to see
*  how your thoughts have changed. So this is sort of an adjacent topic, but are you a follow your
*  passion kind of person? Or, I mean, these aren't, you know, exclusive axes, but follow your passion
*  versus work towards something and then and your passion develops through that. Where would you
*  put yourself in that? I mean, I have been the latter, but I'm becoming more and more follow
*  the passion, right? Kind of guy. Because now I think that again, aging might be part of it too,
*  that I'm like, we're running out of time. Yeah. The line reduces over time. Yeah. I'm like,
*  I don't have time for this thing that like life is now too short. And I have some years I have to do,
*  I have to follow my passion. Otherwise, like, why am I in this job that is not paying as well
*  as other activities that I can do well? And yeah, I mean, if it's not following my passion,
*  I'm in the wrong business. Good to like follow up. I mean, one reason I am like very eager to do
*  this together is just to see myself, I guess this would be a mirror of like, how would I change in
*  years? Would I become that? Because first year in my postdoc, when I joined the lab, I was like,
*  super bubbly and I would jump bouncing off the walls. You're still pretty bubbly. Am I? Okay,
*  good. Great. And then there was an older postdoc in the lab, who told another one in the lab that
*  he's just so happy. Oh, he hasn't been crushed by the system yet. And give him a year or two,
*  he will become like us. Yeah. And I mean, there's truth to that you get maybe defeated by the system,
*  you get crushed, and you will change. Like, I've been thinking about like, now I have these ideals
*  in my head that like, I would be different, I will start a lab, and I would try to implement my
*  thoughts, and I would be a good person. And at some point, I mean, is it like the two faced story of
*  Batman? That what did he say that you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself
*  become the villain? So is that what happens to professors? Or like, or to anyone, right? Like,
*  I was thinking of like, I don't know, like political leaders, I was 2008, one reason I moved to,
*  I was like, very excited to move to the US and not go to like Europe to study, like a bunch of my
*  friends went to like Switzerland or other countries to study and pursue the degrees.
*  Like a mass exodus. It was like, I have more friends now outside of Iran than I have inside.
*  I mean, and like many of them in Silicon Valley now, because like I went to an engineering school.
*  And yeah, this is their friends are rich. Yes, way. I mean, yeah, I guess. I mean, if you go to
*  restaurants, I mean, I will, I mean, you can tell by the kind of restaurants that they pick, and I
*  mean, like staring at the menu prices. I'll have an appetizer, one appetizer. Yes,
*  I'll get an appetizer. Yeah. But so like, it was 2008, Obama was running for presidency. I remember,
*  I was still back home. He was on like campaign tour he gave. And he was like, he was talking in
*  Berlin. And I remember this talk, like, clearly, he was saying that the walls cannot stand. And then
*  he went on talking about like using walls as metaphor for like, prejudice, like,
*  and I love this. Look at this guy. He is so amazing. And like the country will change forever. And
*  like, I guess I was lucky. I joined that year I moved to the US when he would he started
*  becoming president but things didn't like he wasn't like, by the time he left the office,
*  he was not that person anymore. Right. Okay. Like, it's the story of these like, again,
*  is that aging that you become more conservative, you change? Is it like the story of like Berkeley
*  hippies who voted for Reagan? Right? I mean, yes, summer of love, they're all like dancing and happy
*  here. But come 80s, they all voted Reagan. So I don't know. I mean, I'm like, one of my,
*  again, sorry, I'm just telling stories after stories. Great. I think I mean, science is about
*  storytelling part of it, too. So it's all a story. That's the thing. That's something that comes with
*  aging as well. And I suppose wisdom is that it's all stories. It's all stories. Yep. So made up
*  stories. Not true. I mean, valid to some extent, equally valid and invalid gets us to the moon,
*  etc. Yep. We'll take a step. So the first year, I mean, I went to a brain initiative meeting,
*  I think this was Obama speaking of them, Obama brain initiative, like first PI meeting, I was
*  not a PI, but I mean, I guess each PI could take one person. I tagged along with Josh and I'm sitting
*  there. There's this new PI. There's a panel on like data management and codes, etc. There's this
*  new guy. What's he doing? Oh, yeah, I think he was a genealogy or somewhere. One of these like
*  genealogy Alan, some of these is one of these well funded institutes. Yeah. Yeah. And he was like,
*  very comfortable about like code practices and how we should just all share codes and have like a
*  good hub repositories and like Python, but not even Python, Python, like, oh, this is a cool guy.
*  And it was all about open source and three, four. So I was like following him. And after three or
*  four years, I think he left that Institute, whatever it was, and started working for Zuckerberg.
*  Uh huh. And I'm like, Oh, like he sold out. And I want to use that word, but he changed his views
*  and like open academia and everything. Right. He because he was like preaching open academia,
*  right? So much. And then I guess people change, right? So I am interested to see how I would or
*  would not change. I mean, if you're going to become a villain. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well,
*  we don't have to make this like so long or anything, but I want to kind of hold your feet
*  to the fire and not to make you lay out your research plan, but I want to get like your vision,
*  a few years down the road, what you think you might want to accomplish. And so there's that,
*  there's the science aspect and then the whittling away of your bubbly-ness aspect as well that we'll
*  track over time. Yeah. Okay. So science aspect. So I guess in my postdoc, I became a dopamine guy.
*  I studied this molecule and how it affects the behavior. And I think I, and started me,
*  I started thinking about like neuromodulation in general in the brain. Right. Cause I mean,
*  one thing that is very interesting about this molecule and a few other that are similar to this
*  is that like, okay, sorry, let's go one step back. So brain, I mean, how does neuron communicates?
*  They just, they're connected to each other and they chemically communicate with each other,
*  right? That if neuron A is active, it will pass down some action potential that would lead to
*  some chemical getting dumped at the other one. And that other one picks it up and pass it along.
*  Right. So like most of these are like most cells communicate by through like two molecules,
*  glutamates or GABA that are mostly excitatory or inhibitory. So that is very similar to our
*  like artificial neural nets. Right. So you're either positive or negative. You either stimulate
*  the other neuron or inhibit the other neuron. And this is very local. So you have these
*  local networks in different parts of the brain that communicate through these chemicals. But then
*  there are these neuromod, so we call these like neurotransmitters, GABA, glutamate, et cetera.
*  Cells used for transmission like fast transmission. I mean, but then there are these
*  neuromodulators that are not local to the brain. Right. So there's this nuclei somewhere in the
*  brain, in the midbrain that produces dopamine and then broadcast it all over the brain.
*  There's another nuclei that would broadcast serotonin or acetylcholine or norepinephrine.
*  I call them the big four. I mean, in Bay Area, big four are Apple, Google, Microsoft, whatever.
*  But in the brain, my big four are these dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin and norepinephrine.
*  Right. So they seem to have like a more global function in the brain. Right. They don't
*  necessarily excite or inhibit activity of these cells. I mean, they just modulate the activity of
*  these local networks. So my job, I think, would be to understand how these molecules work together
*  to sculpt network states. Sculpt. That's a good word.
*  Yeah. I mean, in the context of cognitive tasks, like very specifically,
*  working memory. I mean, we know that dopamine, for example, is very important for working memory.
*  Working memory is often related to this one part of the prefrontal cortex.
*  Primates would be like dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and rodents would be medial prefrontal
*  cortex. And it seems like if you... So activity of neurons in that brain is related to working
*  memory. But if you deplete that brain area of dopamine, if you disrupt dopaminergic transmission
*  in that area, the effects on behavior on working memory behavior is almost as if you have scooped
*  that part of the brain out. So it is absolutely necessary. And the exact details of it is a bit
*  unknown. And then part of what I found during my postdoc years is that most of these neuromodulators
*  won't act alone. There's a collaborative effort between like, for example, in the stritum that I
*  studied, there is a coordinated activity between dopamine and acetylcholine release. So how these
*  different... And then we know that like working memory, like attention is an important part of
*  working memory. And attention, like historically, people have attributed that to acetylcholine
*  function. And how these... So part of my job would be to better understand how these neuromodulators
*  sculpt network dynamics in the service of certain cognitive behaviors.
*  So what's the answer? And then we'll revisit your hypothesis, your answer.
*  Hmm. I would say that they... Sorry, what's the story going to end up being? We'll talk about it in terms of story.
*  The story is a manifold. And did I say the right word?
*  Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So yeah, I think, I mean, what they do is that if you look at the network dynamics,
*  these neuromodulator would help us get to that stable point, basically.
*  Would help the trajectory get there and stay there.
*  Oh, on a manifold.
*  On a manifold. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Okay. So in let's say five years, what does your lab look like? How many post-docs do you have?
*  How many graduate students?
*  So I think I want to keep it small. I mean, not more than five, six people.
*  Because like I want to be involved more. And I think at some point I will lose my focus if there
*  are like too many projects going on in the lab. I don't want to become just a lab manager.
*  I want to be involved in the science of the lab as well. So I think I'll keep it small,
*  at least to begin with.
*  And you're hell bent on staying in academia.
*  Sorry, what was that?
*  You're hell bent on staying in academia.
*  Yeah.
*  For those listening. I mean, there's a little hitch in there, but with the head bobbing.
*  Right. I guess you never know.
*  You never know. Okay. Anything you want to highlight that we didn't cover?
*  There's so many things that I have to learn between now and then. I'm developing a rule
*  book for the lab. That would be one of my projects now to figure out some of these things.
*  To think more carefully about lab meetings. What is the function of a lab meeting?
*  I will have a blog. I'm planning to start writing some of these thoughts down.
*  I will post them on the blog. And then that would be a way of keeping track of my thoughts as well.
*  What are the best practices for maintaining code in the lab?
*  So I'm working with these. I mean, I love this framework of data joints.
*  I mean, I guess they're a company, but funded by NIH. They provide a platform and a framework
*  for neuroscience data management. I'm working with them as well. And I have to maintain good
*  code practices, data sharing, and all that. I mean, part of it, I want to come up with rule book and
*  things that by the time I start the lab, we have everything established. And it would be like,
*  go, go, go. And it would be, things would be at a state where I could look at everyone's data.
*  And everyone can look at everyone else's data. It would be like, I don't know, Jupiter notebooks
*  that would just go grab your data as you keep, like would analyze your data automatically as you
*  keep adding more data to the repository. It would get lumped into your analysis pipeline.
*  We'll see, I mean, how much of a pipe dream these things are. But I want to spend a good year
*  setting up some good foundation for the lab in terms of technological data management.
*  So my experience as a postdoc and an undergrad, well, more as a postdoc,
*  it's like every year we had these meetings about how we needed to,
*  you know, develop a system that we could all share data and but the tools changed every year.
*  We would end the meeting with optimism that we were going to implement this thing. And then it
*  never really happened, kind of happened. And then the following year, we would have this meeting,
*  well, we need to do this. And now there's this thing that we need to learn. Jupiter notebooks
*  come along, for example, right? And then the next year, you know, then it's GitHub and it for, you
*  know, the the tools changed over time. And the intention remained the same. But it never happened.
*  So this is gonna you're gonna do this, huh? Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm gonna ask for help from people
*  who know this because like spikes are spikes, right? I mean, tools, yes, like analysis tools
*  will change. But I think if we can track that if we can have like, good way, good, like organized
*  way of collecting our data and storing our data, and now there are think attempts by like
*  professionals to do it, because like, in the past, we would do it on our own, right? Like I had my
*  own like way of storing data that was different from the person sitting next to me. I had like
*  the name of these variables. But like now, like neuro data without borders, I think is another
*  attempt to like formalize and have like a data standard for neuroscience. So I'm like very hopeful
*  that by adopting these new frameworks, this can last a bit longer. I mean, we would still have
*  those like regular meetings, I've been into so many of these meetings, and everyone is like, yes,
*  we should share code, we should, like, all organize our data, but then we will go because that's not
*  our job. That's we are not trained to do that, right? But some professionals who like now data
*  joint or nerd data without borders and similar attempts that are funded by NIH and NSF and all
*  these like agencies, I think these are good initiatives. But this is not okay. So this is
*  another thing to track over time. This is not why one gets into science, to think about these things.
*  And you end up spending so much of your time and effort thinking about these meta questions, right?
*  And then some people become enamored with that question instead of the actual science questions.
*  But I don't know, is that do you think that's part of the loss of bubbliness over time?
*  Maybe, yeah, right. But I guess what I want to pay the front, I want to make sure that I'm
*  setting things in place, and I'm getting help from professionals, right? Because like one thing is
*  that sometimes as scientists, we think that we know the answer, and we know how to do it. We are
*  smart. And like, no, I have a better solution for this, right? What does that guy know? I mean,
*  data has to be stored this way. And we that's how we end up with having proliferation of codes,
*  tools, etc. I mean, the saying is that scientists will use each other's toothbrush, but will not
*  use tools and codes. I remember, for some reason, this memory sticks in my head, I think because I'm
*  embarrassed about it. We were I think we were at SFN, and I was a postdoc. And it was a few
*  PIs standing around. And I was part of this conversation talking about the best way to
*  save references to save like PDFs, right? And I was like, No, no, I have the best way how to name them,
*  you know, in the folder. And, you know, and I was so confident. I still I still do it that way. But
*  now just used to it, you know, but everyone had a different way of naming PDFs. And, you know,
*  so yeah, what if we hire professionals who whose job is to do this? I mean, okay, they may not be as
*  smart as you, but that's fine. I mean, I remember this. I mean, a friend of mine once, he said, like,
*  he had he was going through rough patch and said, like, in my therapy sessions, I would go to
*  therapy. But then my goal was to prove to my therapist that I'm smarter than you. Oh, geez.
*  And then at some point said that the therapist was smart person. They got back to me and said,
*  Look, you are very smart. You're smarter than me. Okay. Now let's get to it. But this is my job.
*  I'm trained to do this. Can we please like, can you stop this game?
*  So the therapist knew that they were working with a narcissist?
*  Yes. Yeah. I mean, it's very clear, right? It becomes clear. I mean, we both have worked with
*  narcissists. We know how I mean, it just sticks out. So I think, I mean, sometimes we have that
*  attitude with like, tool development or software, etc, etc. That thing like, no, I mean, let some
*  professional do that. I mean, like an editor in a journal, right? I mean, you may know better how
*  to like, write. That was chat GPT, maybe. I mean, you should just submit. I mean, they may know
*  better than you how to write things. But I mean, the ideas are still yours. And I mean, one advice
*  I was given, like I said, I'm like soliciting advice was that if you can spend money to solve
*  a problem, if you can solve problem by throwing money at it, just do that. Don't try to reinvent
*  the wheel. And money is fungible. Time is not. Don't spend a year coming up with a solution that
*  already exists just to save. But the time you're losing is worth more than that. The last point
*  that I wanted to say that I missed is that I've been to many career panels in years and some of
*  I walked out of many of these like very resentful. And why a guy would show up on these? I mean,
*  because like when you're postdoc and you're looking for academic positions, you are very desperate
*  because the odds of getting that job is very low. And most of the stories that you hear in career
*  panels have this like survivalist bias to them. Right? Yeah. It's the story. And like we talked
*  about how like stories are post hoc, we make up these stories after. I mean, and then you see this
*  person sitting up there and telling you what to do to be successful in science. And they're like,
*  no, I mean, don't forget what stage you were at when you were postdoc applying for these jobs.
*  And this is one of my worries that I don't want to become a person. I remember how stressful it is.
*  I mean, I want to keep remembering how stressful it is to apply for an academic position and how
*  low your odds are. I send out applications, maybe 40 applications to different schools.
*  Is that average? What do you think is average? I think that's average. Right. I mean, I've heard
*  people sending up to 80. So there were not, I would have sent 80, but there were not positions
*  that I would have been interested in. I did not hear back from 20 of them, like nothing radio
*  silence. I mean, would have appreciated a very kind rejection that you're great and amazing,
*  but we had a great pool of applicants. Sorry, come back next year. So like half of them,
*  I didn't hear anything. Half of them, I mean, maybe 10 of them, I got rejections from the same
*  formal letter. I appreciate. Yep. And I got 10 zoom interviews. So they have like two stages.
*  First, they do a screening interview now, they call it, which might be like 10 people or something
*  around those numbers. And then they invite like two or three or four people on campus for visits.
*  So I got 10 of these zoom interviews and I got four campus visits. And I guess like
*  in the end, I had like three offers to choose from, right? Which I feel like very fortunate
*  for this. And there's definitely an element of luck in this. And
*  um, so many talented, amazing, brilliant friends of mine might not have had that chance.
*  Or like, I was lucky that I was privileged enough to stay in academia during the pandemic.
*  I know so many people had to, against their will, I mean, have to choose other careers,
*  because there's nothing wrong with not choosing academia. There's absolutely everything is right
*  about not choosing. It's a training stage, right? You're getting trained to decide what to do next,
*  right? That next thing should not necessarily, I mean, it doesn't work on paper numbers, right?
*  So like what I don't want people to take from this conversation we now have is like, I don't want
*  um, uh, like my enthusiasm about this job just defeat that. I mean, I don't want it to be
*  interpreted wrongly as if like, do your best and you'll get the job that you deserve. No,
*  it doesn't happen. I mean, often, and I think there's something wrong with academia,
*  like with the way we train people for jobs that don't exist sometimes moving forward,
*  I want to be like very, uh, cognitive of this. I want like in my lab, I want to provide opportunities
*  for like alternative careers because like, I mean, yeah, this is broken in academia. Um,
*  if you promise everyone that you will get an academic position, right? And if you train them
*  for this, I mean, it will be just disappointment. What about, um, if you have, let's say you have a
*  graduate student or a postdoc in your lab that you judge to be incompetent with respect to the
*  particular skills needed or questions being needed to be asked, what, what do you do with them? Do you
*  um, or do you sit down and have an honest conversation with them? Do you let them
*  perseverate? What do you do? Yeah, I mean, uh, incompetent in what sense? I mean, I think,
*  I mean, all of us, I mean, are competent in some aspect of our behavior, right? I mean,
*  I think we have to just find out what is the thing. Like my role as a mentor would be to help you get
*  what you want, right? I'm like the dopamine guy, right? We'll not excite or inhibit a cell. I would
*  just modulate. I'm just sitting there to help you modulate to get what you want out of this, right?
*  So if you are struggling in the year, like a third year, I think we should have an honest
*  conversation about your goals, your career goals, right? Cause like there's like me going into this
*  like job markets. I was thinking that, okay, I'll try it. There's a chance I'll get a job and there's
*  a very good chance I will not get a single offer. And then I will move on with my life. I'll find
*  another thing that would make me happy and fulfilled in life. I love baking. I would do that,
*  but I can, there are so many other like good research opportunities here in the Bay area
*  where I live that I can work for a company who studies, who's interested in these, the stuff that
*  I'm interested in, like academia is not the only solution or like if nothing works, like I
*  can have another thing that makes me fulfilled. So I think part of my job would be to help this
*  person who's struggling to struggle less and find something that's more meaningful for them.
*  And sometimes I think that people don't do that in academia. Some like, I don't want to say mentors
*  because a good mentor should do that. Some advisors and supervisors will not do that. I had this
*  conversation during the jobs interview cycle that I was going around, having you meet with so many
*  people and talk, I had this exact conversation with one professor. I asked him, what do you think
*  I should do with this person? I mean, should I guide them to select an alternative career or not?
*  And his answer, which broke my heart was that, are they useful to your research or not?
*  So it's pragmatic. So yeah, this is a person who's been in science for a long time.
*  Yeah. And what he said is that if they're good, if they're doing the job that you want,
*  keep them. It's your career on the line. It's out there. The thought is out there. It's like,
*  it's your career. If they're useful for you, if you've trained them for three years and they're
*  useful to you, just keep them. And yeah, I mean, that is what maybe, I mean, some people think that
*  way. I don't think. I would help them gain expertise. I would assign them to projects that
*  would give them skills that would be useful for alternative careers. Or if someone, I mean, yeah,
*  I mean, I was at, when I was a grad student halfway through, like I told you earlier that
*  I wanted to drop out. I mean, that was a recommendation that I received.
*  But everyone feels that way at some point, right?
*  Yeah, fair. Maybe.
*  Most people.
*  Most people may think, yeah, you may feel that. And like, I was totally fine. Now,
*  like I was totally fine. I wouldn't felt like a failure, right? No, this is, I mean,
*  this is not a good choice at this point. And if I continue doing things that I don't like and I
*  struggle in, that's maybe more of a failure than like, choosing like, voluntarily and actively
*  and consciously making a brave choice of leaving the comforts of being there and seeking
*  alternative careers. So yeah, I don't want, yeah, I mean, I want to remember this. I want to remember
*  the stress that I went through during the application, all the waiting, waiting there for
*  not getting hearing back from any school. There's this group of, I think it's called like FuturePI,
*  Slack. There's a Slack group of like a Discord community.
*  Oh, what a bummer. What a depressing job.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I was advised to just sign up, which I don't know, maybe it was not the best decision.
*  You go on there and then people post their expect, like, and you would see, I mean,
*  you applied for positions and you would see someone saying that I got a job interview at
*  this position. That's how you realize that, okay, you were rejected. I didn't get one.
*  There was this morning that some, and people write their experiences. It's fascinating.
*  Someone should like compile these. I mean, someone wrote that they went on a campus interview visit
*  at one of the Ivy Leagues. One day they got an email from department chair that,
*  are you ready for a phone conversation? Is there a good time? I want to have a phone conversation
*  with you. I mean, often when you get a phone conversation, that's a good thing, or like a call,
*  it's a good thing, meaning that they want to offer you the job. So this person gets all happy and
*  excited and the department chair gets on the phone, tells them that you did not get the job by,
*  and the person was complaining that, I mean, you could have done this over via email, right? This
*  was not necessary. So I read that one morning before going to work and that same day I get an
*  email from department chair in Madison, Wisconsin, that Ali, you have time for phone conversation.
*  And this is in my head now. That's okay. I didn't get this one too. And I'm just,
*  I'm waiting for her to call me and say that I didn't get the job. So I feel the stress.
*  And we talk and she starts by saying that Ali, I have some good news for you. Like,
*  good news? Is it like good, good? And she's like, yeah, I wouldn't have called you otherwise. I mean,
*  and it was hard for me to believe because of that morning I read that thing that happened to this
*  other person. So like one thing I don't want to forget is this feeling, like this valid feeling of
*  being in this stressful situation that none of us signed up for when we started.
*  Going into grad school, we thought it would be all like, do your job. And if you do your job correctly,
*  you will get a job. It's like medical doctors, right? I mean, if you do your job correctly,
*  you will get a job that you like, right? Maybe it's not in that institute or that hospital
*  specifically, but you will get a job as a practicing doctor if you don't screw it up.
*  Right. In science, there's no guarantee like that. Maybe many of us entered thinking that way that
*  like, I'll get my job done. Like, what do you need? Do you need the CNS paper? Do you need me to get
*  grants? I mean, we jumped through all these arbitrary hoops that you're setting up, right?
*  And still, it's just a gamble. So I mean, part of me going into academia is that like, I don't want
*  to be just a scientist. I want to have a voice and be activist and be leader, have a say in trying.
*  And there are good people, friends of mine who are like, I think we're a team together, like good
*  younger generation who have like some support among the more senior generation. But I think,
*  I mean, we will try to change things. I hope this is not like Obama change, like talking about
*  things. But I'll see. Let's check in. Maybe. Yeah, we'll check in later. Yeah. I mean, I don't want
*  this to be one of those career panels sound like one of those survival stories. We don't have time
*  now. Maybe next time I'll tell you, unless I've already told you, my just getting into graduate
*  school was kind of a long story and involved phone calls, negative, positive and negative for me as
*  well. Yeah. So I don't know. Are we ending on a high note? Is that a high? It's a high note.
*  Okay. Ali Mohabbi, the dopamine guy, foolishly optimistic, gonna change things and lead
*  the change. That's I like that. There you go. All right. Yep. Better future. Okay.
