# BI 166 Nick Enfield: Language vs. Reality
**Brain Inspired:** [May 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7miCG29sBc0)
*  What I'm interested in is humanity and really the fundamental questions of anthropology
*  are the ones that we're trying to answer, which is, you know, what is universal about
*  humans or what makes us all the same but unlike all the other species we're related to?
*  The words are not really meant to capture the specifics of the perception.
*  They're meant to be kind of landmarks that we coordinate around, right?
*  So their function really is primarily about social coordination.
*  You know, you're not particularly free when it comes to what you want to express and how
*  you want to express it.
*  We're very much at the mercy of something, of a system, namely in our current case, English.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  I'm Paul.
*  Nick Enfield is a professor of linguistics at the University of Sydney and he calls himself
*  a linguistic anthropologist.
*  You'll learn what that means in a few minutes.
*  In this episode, we discuss topics in his most recent book, Language vs Reality, why
*  language is good for lawyers and bad for scientists.
*  A central question in the book is, what is language for?
*  What's the function of language?
*  This is a question that people answer in different ways.
*  So you might be familiar with the debate about whether language evolved for each of us to
*  think our own wonderful human thoughts or evolved for communicating those thoughts and
*  information between each other.
*  So Nick would be on the communication side of that debate.
*  But if by communication we mean simply the transmission of thoughts or information between
*  people like, I have a thought, I send it to you in language and that thought is now in
*  your head, then Nick wouldn't take either side of the debate.
*  He argues that the function of language goes beyond the transmission of information and
*  instead is primarily an evolved solution for social coordination problems, coordinating
*  our behaviors and attention.
*  When we use language, we're creating maps in our heads so we can agree on where to go.
*  So for example, when I say this is brain inspired, I'm pointing you to a place to meet me on
*  a conceptual map saying, get ready, we're about to have a great time again.
*  Or if you're my wife's aunt, Allison, it means get ready to not understand anything I'm talking
*  about again.
*  Hi, Allison.
*  Hope you and Bruce are well.
*  Or if you're my curmudgeon expert friend, I won't name names here, but it would mean
*  to get ready to send me that text about what went wrong in the episode.
*  So in any case, with those four words, this is brain inspired.
*  I'm not just transmitting some information from my head into your head.
*  I'm providing you with a landmark so you can focus your attention appropriately.
*  From that premise that language is about social coordination, we talk about a handful of topics
*  in his book, like the relationship between language and reality, the idea that all language
*  is framing, that is how we say something influences how to think about it.
*  We discuss how our language changes in different social situations, the role of stories, and
*  of course, how large language models fit into Nick's story about language.
*  I had a ton more to ask Nick, and his excellent book covers a lot more, but we were a little
*  rushed for time.
*  So hopefully I'll have him back on the podcast soon enough to keep the conversation going.
*  I linked to the book and Nick's information in the show notes at braininspired.co.
*  Slash podcast slash one hundred sixty six.
*  Apologies if my audio isn't as good as usual.
*  I've been in transition for a while, but I'm now in my new place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
*  and I'm still putting my new quote unquote studio together, but I should have it back
*  in shape soon enough.
*  So thank you for listening and your patience.
*  And thank you to everyone who supports Brain Inspired through Patreon and through my online
*  course about the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
*  You can learn more about those at braininspired.co.
*  And now this is Nick Enfield.
*  Maybe maybe this is a question.
*  It was going to be a comment, but I'll make it a question.
*  Is it so one of the things that I got from reading your book is that when we learn language,
*  we don't learn necessarily how it affects us and how it works, how it affects our cognition
*  and what it's for.
*  Is that an important thing for us to learn in conjunction?
*  Would that solve some of our societal problems if we understood more about what your book
*  is teaching us?
*  Well, to the second part of the question, I would hope that it would help us.
*  I certainly try to make that case in the end of the book that there is a lot of importance
*  to having good knowledge about language because it allows us to, I think, be more mindful
*  about the impacts that language has.
*  And I think that's kind of one of the key messages in the end of the book.
*  But going to the first part of your question, you say when we learn language, you know,
*  language, this is one of the things about language.
*  You learn it in one sense, you learn it as a child and you have this sort of incredible
*  capacity with language to use it, to create new expressions, to, you know, do all the
*  amazing things that linguists learn about in their kind of undergraduate degree in linguistics.
*  It's pretty phenomenal what we do.
*  But the amazing thing is that kids who learn their first language don't, so much of that
*  is not conscious.
*  So when you say when we learn language, perhaps you're talking about when we learn about language
*  or when we learn a second language or something, you know, that is more kind of conscious as
*  adults.
*  But when we learn our first language and we just gain linguistic capacity as a functioning
*  human, you know, I think we really do learn a lot of those aspects of language, certainly
*  as language producers.
*  We are adept at using language as a tool.
*  We're adept at using it to influence others.
*  Perhaps some people are more adept than others.
*  But, you know, my argument and that of many others is that that's what language really
*  is for.
*  So you wouldn't be learning language if you weren't also learning those kind of aspects
*  of language's pragmatic function.
*  So yeah, in answer to your question, I think you need to distinguish between the true learner
*  of a language as in, you know, a two or three year old child who's acquiring a language
*  versus the scholar of language who is very often, you know, not paying attention to those
*  much more social interaction or pragmatic features of language and focusing much more
*  on, let's say, individual oriented aspects of language, informational aspects of language
*  rather than aspects related to action.
*  But if I mean, even learning first language, so I have fairly young kids and they're adept
*  already at language and I didn't tell them, hey, you should read Nick Enfield's book and
*  realize that language is not connected to reality in the way that you might think it
*  is.
*  And I'm wondering if that, you know, how you say things matters.
*  I think that we teach our kids that.
*  But but the nature.
*  So one of the ideas from your book is that our perception is one step abstracted from
*  reality in that we reduce, for instance, the light spectrum, right.
*  The the visible light that we can see is only one small blip of this whole spectrum.
*  Right. And so our perceptions are a reduced dimension.
*  From what you call brute reality.
*  And then language is a further step abstracted from our perceptions.
*  And so there's this kind of two step connection to brute reality.
*  And I think when I learned language, so these are things that I didn't I don't think I
*  appreciated at all, you know, maybe even until reading your book.
*  It hadn't hadn't been put that crystal clear to me.
*  And I don't know.
*  I don't know how it's going to affect my language moving forward.
*  And I don't know how it would have affected my language from the get go.
*  Yeah, I think I would probably think about things going in a slightly different direction.
*  I mean, I feel that things like understanding that brute reality is far, far richer than
*  you can perceive.
*  Is is not where you start, right?
*  I mean, that is quite hard to comprehend.
*  And it's something that, in fact, requires language, at least in part, for you to get
*  access to. So over history, humans have made discoveries about the world beyond what we
*  can perceive with our bodies.
*  And, you know, we're able to draw each other's attention to these things.
*  We're able to kind of, you know, hack the environment in various ways and discover that
*  there are frequencies we're not perceiving.
*  And that kind of thing.
*  So getting to understand the brute reality in that fullest sense is very unusual.
*  And we're not built for that, right?
*  We're literally not evolved to know about a whole lot of reality.
*  And so I think that, you know, you could say a starting point for reality for humans is
*  what we perceive and it's the band, it's the spectrums of light and sound that we can
*  actually perceive.
*  And over time, of course, we learn to take cues that would help us to know other things
*  about the world. So an example might be frequencies that you can't hear.
*  Now, if there's a sound in a frequency you can't hear, well, you can't hear it, right?
*  But maybe a dog can hear it and they start reacting to it.
*  And then the dog's reaction is then a sign for you and you know, OK, something's happening.
*  I don't know what it is, but, you know, the dog reacts in this way.
*  But even in that case, what's happened is that the dog has kind of transformed the sound
*  into something else that now I can perceive.
*  So there's that whole sort of translation piece where you somehow to get to get access
*  to a larger reality, it's still got to be packaged in a way that you can perceive it.
*  So that's kind of looking down into brute reality.
*  But then when we kind of look up into the linguistic representation of it, well, that's
*  another kind of ridiculously dumbed down version of what you actually perceive.
*  Right. So we just take color.
*  You can perceive hundreds of thousands and maybe millions of just discernible differences
*  in shades of color.
*  As your bookshelf behind you can attest to.
*  Yeah, but we don't have labels for all those and language is very a great deal.
*  It's very well known literature on how language is different in terms of their color vocabulary.
*  But even the most, you know, even a Dulux paint catalog with, you know, two and a half
*  thousand different distinctions in paint is still a fraction of what you can actually perceive.
*  So and that's a kind of a crazily over differentiated set of the space for very specific kind of
*  economic purposes.
*  But most for most people in life, you get away with a very, very kind of blunt kind
*  of differentiation of the perceived space.
*  And why do we get away with that?
*  Because the words are not really meant to capture the specifics of the perception.
*  They're meant to be kind of landmarks that we coordinate around.
*  Right. So their function really is primarily about social coordination.
*  And I think that's the thing that's kind of this massive kind of, I don't know, blindspot in some sense in the cognitive
*  science of language, I think that that that is really that coordination is not something that you take language and
*  then go and do with.
*  It's really the other way around.
*  So, you know, you said at the start of your question, you've got young kids and and, you know.
*  Well, to my mind, young kids aren't that much concerned about the relation between language and perception.
*  Obviously, they have perceptions and they need to connect language to them in some way or another.
*  But what's primarily interesting about language for young kids is that they can use it to
*  manipulate, especially the other agents in their vicinity.
*  So I'm sure that your kids are very good at manipulating you.
*  And no, no, no.
*  So you say they're not sure how old they are.
*  But, you know, from a very young age, not just using language, of course, you know.
*  So it just is very powerful at a young age.
*  But as soon as they get onto the idea that.
*  Words create responses in other people, quite specific ones, then, you know, that's what becomes interesting about a about a word.
*  And, you know, I think that it's their embeddedness in sequences of action, their embeddedness in
*  people's courses of behavior that makes them interesting.
*  So take a simple example, I don't know, something like a verb like open or I guess an adjective to set to be open or to open something.
*  You know, you can argue about what exactly that word means and what is the physics of something being open or closed.
*  And when would you, you know, you could study the reality of things that are open or closed and argue about what the what the concept is.
*  But if you look at. How that word gets used with young children, well, it's going to be about things like.
*  We open the box and, you know, then an activity begins at the toy box, for example, we pull out the toys and we play and then it's over and we have to close it.
*  And kids will associate open with the sort of beginning of an activity and close with the end of an activity.
*  And you have these associations that are not really about kind of measuring the physical world,
*  but they're about being embedded in a sequence of activity and action.
*  And that becomes the initial meaning for the initial association.
*  The most important kind of association is how words link to courses of action and particularly interaction.
*  So, OK, well, this opens up many things that I wanted to ask you about.
*  Maybe, though, I would like to back up and I should have done this in the beginning because your title or the title of your vocation,
*  the name you give to your vocation is that you're a linguistic anthropologist.
*  And one of the things I enjoyed from your book is reading about all the anecdotes from your travels.
*  And it struck me that you have, through your work, lived a rich life interacting with so many different societies and languages.
*  And so I guess my question is, have you lived?
*  Do you feel like you have lived a rich life through your work?
*  And then what is a linguistic anthropologist? So so that I can understand it myself.
*  Well, I'm still living. I'm still living. So hopefully many more decades.
*  Best of all, yes, of course.
*  Yeah. Yes, absolutely.
*  I'm incredibly fortunate and incredibly grateful that, you know, I've had an amazing number of experiences in cultures,
*  very unlike my own and places that aren't like the place where I grew up.
*  And that's, I think, probably something that got me into what I do is a fascination with travel and with diversity.
*  What's a linguistic anthropologist is really I identify that way because what I'm interested in is humanity.
*  And really the fundamental questions of anthropology are the ones that we're trying to answer, which is.
*  You know, what is universal about humans or what makes us all the same, but unlike all the other species we're related to?
*  That's sort of one question. And the other question is, what are the constraints on the diversity within our species?
*  So, you know, we have this incredible differences. We have these thousands of languages.
*  We have these different livelihoods and value systems.
*  And what is the what are the possibilities for diversity?
*  So that's the kind of fundamental question of anthropology, which has been around for a long time.
*  And it's not so much you do still hear this term, but there's a there's a there's a notion of anthropology as having four fields.
*  And linguistics was originally conceived as one of these fields.
*  Yeah. So when people use the term linguistic anthropology, sometimes they mean, you know,
*  it's that field of anthropology that is concerned with looking at that universals and diversity in language.
*  These days, of course, that's kind of captured within many fields of linguistics itself.
*  And anthropology is kind of developed in the four fields.
*  Conception is not necessarily used by everyone.
*  But that's how I view it is that essentially I'm looking at language as a way of answering the basic questions of anthropology,
*  which have to do with human universals and diversity.
*  OK. All right. Thank you for that clarification.
*  I wish you many happy, fulfilling years ahead, by the way, and continue.
*  Yeah, look, I mean, you know, the work that we've done.
*  In linguistic anthropology, I mean, this thing going on for a long time way before me, of course, but, you know,
*  it does coming back to your rich life question, I mean, it's doing fieldwork and getting out into other.
*  Cultures. And trying to understand them and participate with them is just so enlightening in some sense, right?
*  It not only are you learning something, but what you're doing is changing your.
*  Kind of calibration, you're recalibrating yourself in some way, and, you know,
*  that's obviously important from a scientific research point of view, but also it's it's it's good for you.
*  You see what your own presuppositions are, hopefully.
*  And, you know, that that helps to draw your attention to the things you're taking for granted.
*  So I think, you know, in terms of.
*  Scientific approach, that's important, but it's also it's also good as a general principle.
*  I was going to ask you this later, but I'll ask you now.
*  And I know that we haven't gotten into many details about what your ideas and work actually say.
*  But, you know, has your work affected how you use language and interpret language like kind of on a daily basis?
*  Do you have an on and off switch or are you constantly thinking about the framing of what's being said and the influence and the social coordination dynamics and stuff?
*  Or are you just sometimes talking and listening?
*  Well, I'm talking most of the time.
*  I mean, it's hard to introspect about these kinds of things.
*  And I, you know, one of the things we we all learn early on in linguistics is that people are quite poor at.
*  At introspection and they believe certain things about how they speak, that that empirically just a false, you know, they say, oh, I would never say that.
*  And then in the next sentence, they say that thing or, you know, I only seldom use that word, but then you record them for a day and they use it all the time.
*  So, you know, we're quite poor at that sort of introspection, but I'll just expect anyway, I think that for me.
*  A lot of the time, of course, I'm just talking and I'm not kind of thinking carefully about this stuff.
*  And one of the reasons, of course, is it has time.
*  I mean, your processing language so quickly, so much has to happen in such a small amount of time when you're when you're just having a conversation.
*  That you know, you literally don't have the bandwidth to to kind of worry about those things.
*  And we do all this stuff in a in a in a fairly unconscious way.
*  But I do think that it enters into more deliberate.
*  Use of language, so.
*  You know, you're giving a talk, you're doing something a bit more formal, you're in a meeting, you know, when you have some, you know, some issue with your kids or whatever, when there's some kind of.
*  More heightened importance in a way to the situation, then, yeah, I think I do become much more aware.
*  I pay more attention to the framings, not just as a producer, but also as a as a comprehender of language.
*  And I think that's helpful.
*  And I think in this day and age, it is especially important to be very.
*  Critical in a way of how framing is being done when you're on the receiving end, because, you know, now it's just so.
*  In terms of the kind of the media that we're being exposed to and so on, you you you really have to be a I'm not sure if you have to be more careful than than we used to be, but just just quantitatively the sheer amount of stuff we're being exposed to.
*  I think is is means that we do need to be more mindful.
*  So coming to your question, I mean, I think probably the answer is yes, I'm becoming more mindful of how language is getting used.
*  And that's what I advocate in the in the book.
*  So hopefully I'm going some way to practicing what I preach.
*  Yeah, I mean, you mentioned the media and.
*  I.
*  See if this see how you feel about this, I'm not sure about the state of your news outlets in Australia, but you know, here it's all about fake news, and I've decided that no news is real news.
*  It's all framed and it's all just influence.
*  And my parents generation in the generation before them, it seemed like it was different because I don't know if the framing was different or the nature of influence in media was different.
*  But it's like you could kind of take some bit of news at face value.
*  And and I'm wondering, here's the question.
*  I'm wondering if like my mom.
*  Still believes the news because she was raised in an environment in which you could believe the news.
*  And so, you know, whatever Fox News or whatever is telling her, she'll just take it kind of face value, even though it's an opinion show or something like that.
*  And have the news outlets just learned to frame everything in a very specific way or do you think that that's right about my parents generation and their parents generation that they could kind of trust the news more?
*  And now that's why these days we're in this predicament where they're being fed.
*  False information or heavily, heavily framed information.
*  I think it's easy to overstate that point.
*  I mean, I think that, you know, we have this tendency to say, well, those are the good old days and now kids these days and that kind of thing.
*  You know, and I think that.
*  Certainly not the case that if you went back 50 years or something, that suddenly everything would be hunky dory and the newspapers would be full of true facts and all of that.
*  So one thing that's clear about newspapers 50 years ago is that they're very selective.
*  You only read about certain things and not other things, and that's already a big kind of difference.
*  And that is less the case now because we have so much more material.
*  So, you know, as a consumer, you have much more choice.
*  You can get much more information than you're used to.
*  So there are clear ways in which the information ecology is better and healthier because you have access to more information.
*  But because of that scaling up of material and also across times and now just endless 24 hour news,
*  that means that the audience capture, you can still you know, you don't have to capture the whole population.
*  You know, you're just going for a particular group and this leads to the kind of classic polarization.
*  So, I mean, I think the thing to really not forget about news is that it's it's it's a money making industry.
*  It's it's just a business. Right.
*  So information is not really the primary concern as in terms of like getting at some version of the truth.
*  That sounds kind of cynical, but I think it's true.
*  And I think it's something always worth worrying about that and being critical about is going back to what I was saying earlier,
*  that you are always consuming something that has been produced that way for a reason.
*  And that's the case just when you're having a regular conversation, different dynamics, of course, and different things are at stake.
*  But but I think that. There are ways in which news and information is worse now and ways in which it's better now.
*  But one of the things that's really highlighted today is that the importance of being our own individual gatekeeper.
*  People, you know, I was asked some time ago on a kind of panel about fake news and post truth and stuff,
*  who should be the gatekeeper of facts?
*  You know, we need fact checking and all this kind of thing.
*  And I think, you know, the the days of excitement about fact checking from a few years ago is kind of waned because partly it's so hard to do if you can even do it at all.
*  But I think it's because it's it's looking at things from the wrong direction.
*  So it's really about critical thinking.
*  It's a kind of it's, you know, it's a bit cognitive literacy, I like to call it, which is to say,
*  you know, we don't need as consumers of news or any language, we don't need a filter before it hits us.
*  As if if we have our own filter that we're able to apply in a kind of mindful way.
*  So if you went back to the news that your your your mum was reading, you know, as a kid or a young person or whatever,
*  it would have different properties, but you would certainly need to read it mindfully if you wanted to get at what was actually going on.
*  So the news of that time might have been quite.
*  Balanced, let's say, or if you know, relatively objective for that audience,
*  but just look at, well, you know, if it's reporting some kind of foreign policy or some kind of event that's happening overseas,
*  are we getting any perspective from the people on the ground over there?
*  Seems unlikely. Are we hearing about things that are happening between groups over there that don't that don't sort of concern us?
*  It seems unlikely. So there's a whole lot of things that are being filtered out and there's just as much need then
*  for reading news in a discerning way as there is now.
*  Well, yeah, I don't want to I don't want this to devolve into a political episode, obviously.
*  But but thinking about so so when you know, you argue that the main function of language is for social social coordination
*  of social problems, essentially.
*  And we already talked about the two degrees of separation between language and reality.
*  Does that mean that language cannot describe truth?
*  And I'll back up. And obviously, when I write a science paper, I'm telling a story and I'm using language to do so.
*  Should I be concerned that there's just no way that I can describe something the way that it actually is?
*  Am I am I trying to describe truth or am I telling a story to influence the reader that it is true?
*  You know, how do I how should I think about language versus truth?
*  Well, you can do both those things.
*  You know, hopefully the thing that you're saying is true and you can convey it to a person while through through the tool of influencing them.
*  So that's what you want to do is to get the kind of influencing function of language to align with some sort of fidelity around reality.
*  First thing I'd say is there's a distinction between reality and truth, I think.
*  So, you know, reality is the stuff we come up against, the thing that makes us die, et cetera.
*  Truth is really a property of of assertions that you make in language.
*  So, you know, is that true or not is is not a question about the world.
*  It's a question about your claim about the world.
*  And so really, it's it's about language.
*  The question of truth is really about language and and the claims that we make are very vague and they're very underspecified.
*  And that's by design.
*  So, you know, if you want to coordinate with someone around some statement, then you don't want to go to too much trouble.
*  You just want to make a statement that's good enough for the purpose.
*  So it's a classic kind of, you know, min max trade off kind of thing.
*  You you want to go to as little trouble as you can in formulating your utterance in order to achieve the goal.
*  So, you know, you might say something like.
*  There's a dog in the backyard.
*  You know, and whatever the situation, you can imagine why I might say that to you.
*  Maybe I'm checking, is that your dog or is that normal?
*  Is it like the neighbor's dog or what are we going to do about this or whatever?
*  But I use the word dog, and that's kind of this category term for really great variety of beasts.
*  Right. When I say there's a dog in the backyard, I don't tell you anything about this dog, its color, its shape, its breed, how it's acting, all these things.
*  Because for the purpose of that statement and what I might be trying to kind of what response I might be trying to get out of you, those details are irrelevant.
*  So I have just the level of specificity around reality that I that I need for this for this function that I'm trying to serve right now.
*  Or, you know, I'm at the table and I say, can you pass me a spoon?
*  Well, I don't mind a plastic metal spoon, whatever.
*  Just for this for the purpose of what I want you to you to do now, this word should be good enough.
*  So in relation to your question.
*  What specific spoon it is and what its real measurable qualities are is not at issue for why I've selected this word or that specific dog.
*  You know, it's measurable, real qualities are not what's at issue, even though I could.
*  They might become they might come. If you ask me, oh, is it is a black dog?
*  Then it matters because, OK, maybe the next door's dog is black and it comes through the fence sometimes or whatever the case may be.
*  So there's a it's really important with language that the concern is not just does this.
*  Expression or this choice of words.
*  Bear a relation of being true or not true in relation to what I'm talking about, it's really what is it being used for?
*  What is the response it's being used?
*  To elicit what task are we trying to accomplish by using this term?
*  And that might be a joint task.
*  We might be cooperating towards some end or it might be some sort of manipulative task on my part.
*  But either way, it requires coordination between the producer and the comprehender of that bit of language.
*  Does that answer your question? Yeah, yeah.
*  I'm also so I've been, I guess, self critical or critical of lately on the podcast and a kind of a devil's advocate sort of approach.
*  I've been critical of language as having the, you know, sitting at the in the sitting at the top of our cognitive capacities.
*  Right. We're so special because we have language and I've been sort of testing that hypothesis somewhat informally.
*  Saying, you know, because I feel dumb when I think in words and and thinking about the connection of language to our actual experience,
*  which is of a much higher granularity or well, much finer scale granularity.
*  Right. And you take like a concept or a word and it reduces it away again, one more step from away from brute reality.
*  And so my question is, do you how do you view language in terms of our cognitive capacities and, you know, how where is it in the hierarchy of our cognitive capacity?
*  And a related question, and maybe this can kind of funnel you into that.
*  The answer to that is, you know, there are people who literally talk out loud to themselves all the time or, you know, can't seem to function without speaking.
*  And there's this term called process blocking that if you and I are at a party and I'm just yammering on like this, as I am, you can't even think straight because I'm interfering with your process because I'm influencing you.
*  So can people spend too much time in language land in their daily lives or, you know, if someone just talks so much, does that mean that they're higher cognitively, etc.?
*  Yeah, that's an interesting question.
*  I don't know if I if I have any kind of opinion on that, you know, people who talk a lot and people who don't talk as much.
*  That puzzles me a lot. And I, you know, it's not something I've studied, but it's something I've thought about.
*  We were talking, I was talking with colleagues yesterday about students in university classrooms that some students talk all the time and then other students are dead quiet.
*  And often there's an assumption that, you know, a student who's always piping up, it's kind of a really good student and does well.
*  But, you know, you get this some students who don't seem to say a thing and then they just ace the assignments and exams.
*  So, you know, I think that we don't want to over associate talking with kind of some capacity to think and reason.
*  And I think this is one of the issues that I keep coming back to in my in my work and certainly in this book.
*  And that is that we're always when we're talking about language in a kind of scientific context, we always seem to be coming back to thinking and reasoning and concepts and cognition and individual internal ideas.
*  Which is the exact opposite of the message in your book.
*  Exactly. So, you know, that really you can have all of those things, images and ideas and reasoning and categorization of a kind without having language at all.
*  Right. I mean, you can be a creature that doesn't have language and you can reason about the world and act in accordance with it and so on.
*  And we are creatures of that kind. And we have all that internal cognitive life, too.
*  But having language makes a big difference, I think.
*  Well, I'm going to say in two ways, I mean, one is because of all this public stuff that we do with language, which is about manipulating others in very specific ways, putting descriptions of things on record and by which any description is a very specific framing of something that's going on.
*  You know, highlighting certain things, de-emphasizing certain things and making claims about what's in front of us.
*  You know, is this a dog? Is this a mutt? Is this a pet?
*  I can frame this thing in certain kinds of ways for social interaction purposes, not because the reality kind of gets me to do that.
*  So once we build up these labels, these words that have rich kind of ideas or maybe not very rich, sometimes pretty stripped back, I guess I'd want to say, but we build up these labels, we build up these categories in language.
*  And of course, then that's going to have some effect back on the kind of inner conceptual life.
*  So I recently wrote something where I tried to kind of sharpen a distinction, which I feel is really not often made and surprisingly not often made.
*  And that's simply the distinction between non-linguistic concepts and linguistic concepts.
*  So, you know, if you look in the concepts literature, literature about.
*  Yeah, I mean, just pick up a book that has the word concepts in the title.
*  And you'll see people are talking about things like dog and cat and doorknob and walk and, you know, on and all these things that happen to have labels in a language.
*  Just so happens they have labels in a language.
*  And my argument is that, you know, that really conflates two very different kinds of mental entity.
*  Right. So one famous paper by Frager that's often cited for distinguishing between sense and reference where reference is what a word,
*  something in the world that a word points to and sense is sort of the meaning of the word.
*  But in that paper, he also pointed to what he called idea.
*  So idea is really, I think, what you were referring to just before, which is, you know, you're completely rich in experience of something.
*  So let's say I say the word dog and you are underdog as a kid and all your experiences of dogs and, you know,
*  everything about them, all your sensory perceptions and your grounded cognition of dogs and everything else.
*  But that doesn't come into issue when we communicate using the word dog.
*  So that your idea is this very individualized, very rich, personal kind of mental thing.
*  And the sense of the word is this other kind of concept.
*  So I talk about I concepts and L concepts in this in this recent thing I've written.
*  And that's to point out that, you know, if you want to talk about linguistic concepts specifically, it's a very different beast.
*  It's something that is built through interaction for interaction.
*  It's something that's going to necessarily be stripped back because it only has to be good enough for communication,
*  not for making decisions about how I deal with this creature when I encounter it in a dark alley or whatever, you know,
*  individual decision making processes have to take place.
*  These things are created by and created for social coordination.
*  Is this are you referring to the self generating idea of a concept paper?
*  Well, no, that's another recent paper that is related to this stuff.
*  So this is a paper that's not published yet that I've just recently drafted about concepts and concepts.
*  But the other paper that you're referring to was recently published in Transactions.
*  Yeah, because, well, I wanted to ask you about that.
*  I like that your conception of a concept as a self generating thing, which is in that you have two different axes.
*  And we don't need to get, you know, super technical about it.
*  But can you just talk about your I'll call it a processural or process based view of what a concept is?
*  I think they use the term dynamic in the paper to describe how you view linguistic concepts.
*  Yeah, so in that paper, as you just said, I invoke the term choice architecture.
*  You know, there's this literature on nudge theory and on the idea that but also a sort of large literature on design and how,
*  you know, the way that you design a door handle, for example, will determine whether people reach for it with a hand shape like that or with a shape like that.
*  So the environment sort of.
*  Speaks to you in some sense, that's a classic kind of old insight about how we interact with the environment.
*  So if you're a designer, then what you're doing is, you know, let's say you're designing doors.
*  So there's a famous Donald Norman kind of work on how doors get designed.
*  If you're a designer and you're designing a door.
*  Your specific choice of how that door will open will should communicate to people what they're supposed to do with their body,
*  like they press it and push through or they grab a door knob, you know, so that the door communicates with you and that determines your choices.
*  So it has what we call choice architecture.
*  And so there's an actual interaction or as a dynamic relation between how this static object is structured physically, the door and what you do when you
*  encounter it and want to functionally engage with it.
*  Right. You want to open the door. Well, you have to sort of make choices of how you're going to do that with your body.
*  So it's a it's a it's a sort of stimulus response type of axis.
*  And that's been stripped out of how we think about language for a long time, famously going back to kind of anti-behaviorism and so on.
*  The problem is it was sort of thrown out with the bathwater and the real what you really want to do is combine a view of language that is there's one
*  axis, which is, you know, some bit of language as a stimulus that gives rise to a response in someone else and another axis, which is really the cognitive
*  axis, which is, you know, some bit of language maps onto some mental representations that I might have.
*  So, yeah, that's probably as far as we want to get in terms of the technical side.
*  But it becomes a dynamic process because any time you encounter a bit of language, it's like a door that you have to decide, you know, how do I shape my hand in order to open it?
*  You you get a bit of language directed to you and you make decisions.
*  So how am I going to respond to this?
*  How am I going to adjust my beliefs or whatever it may be, whether it's interaction or you're just reading something, it's affecting you and you're updating, you know, who and what you are and what you're going to do next kind of thing.
*  And that very kind of action based aspect of how language works and what it's for is, I think, underappreciated in how we think about the function of concepts.
*  So from that, that is L concepts, the linguistic concepts.
*  From that point of view, a linguistic concept is something that is designed partly just through, you know, emergently in a population, but also locally, I'm designing my utterances to affect you in a particular way.
*  And in that sense, it's a piece of choice architecture.
*  It's something that is directing you, nudging you in a certain way.
*  Whatever I'm trying to say, I could have said it in these other ways, but I'm not saying it this way.
*  And hopefully that will set you in the direction that is the desired one, either desired for me or desired for us, whatever the context happens to be.
*  So all language is choice architecture and framing, whether we are intending it that way or not.
*  Yeah, I think that's true.
*  I think that it's just something you have to live with.
*  And one reason I think that helps to make clear that that's the case is that, you know, we're never talking about language in the abstract.
*  Where when we're talking about language and concepts, we're always gravitating to particular languages, some language like English or Japanese or French or, you know, six or seven thousand languages that are spoken in the world today.
*  And who knows how many hundreds of thousands have been spoken through history?
*  You know, each one of them.
*  Is going to present a very different array of available concepts, which don't exhaust the possibility space by any stretch of the imagination.
*  So, you know, just the resources that you're drawing on when you're using language.
*  This small subset of of all the possibilities, and that should indicate to you that it's a very biased system, right?
*  So that you even I can take words and I can combine them in new ways and say new things that you haven't heard before.
*  But I still am limited to the resources that my language gives me.
*  And I can't reinvent my language in any serious way on the fly.
*  So what that suggests is that, you know, you're not particularly free when it comes to what you want to express and how you want to express it.
*  I mean, you're a bit free, but you're very much at the mercy of something of a system, namely in our current case, English, that has been developed through history within a particular cultural context that we don't have any control over.
*  So I realize that we're kind of all over the place, so I apologize.
*  But going back to this idea of language as a coordination solving entity cognitive function function.
*  So in, I guess, the cognitive sciences, there's this kind of classical debate whether language is for thinking or for communication.
*  And your ideas, I guess, would lean more toward the communication side, but it really goes beyond that because it's about agency and coordinating in the world.
*  Do I do I have that right?
*  Is that the right way to look at it?
*  Well, absolutely. So, I mean, there's a few things to say here.
*  One question is, like, what are we what do we use it for?
*  Just empirically, like, what's what do we use it for?
*  You could go out and somehow count instances of people communicating with language versus people using it to think if you had some way of kind of doing that.
*  I think that one answer would be, well, that's irrelevant.
*  You know, the modern in this day and age, we've realized this wonderful epiphenomenon of linguistic thinking, which is that now we can talk to each other and let's do that a lot.
*  So I don't think that would change people's minds about kind of what's fundamentally different or interesting about language.
*  But what I would say in response to that is it's not just what.
*  A language gives rise to what it can be used to create, like, you know, a new thought or a decision or an action on behalf of someone else.
*  But but but just as important is where did it where does that particular bit of language come from?
*  How was it? How was it brought about?
*  And this brings me back to the point I was just making about how whenever we talk about concepts, we're naming particular words in particular languages.
*  How did those things come about?
*  Well, they came about through social interactions and through those social interactions are the only thing that cause the words that we're talking about to circulate within populations.
*  So you asked me about that paper about self generating choice architectures.
*  And we talked about the choice architecture part, but not the self generating part.
*  And this dynamic kind of cycle of bits of language being used to give rise to responses in social interaction,
*  that itself causes bits of language to circulate within a population.
*  So I like to quote this line by Daniel Dennett when he's talking about kind of circulation of diffusion of innovations in populations of new tech.
*  And he says, OK, well, a wagon wheel is this wonderful invention that can help you transport stuff from place to place.
*  But what it also does is it transports the wonderful idea of a wagon wheel with it.
*  So when you see that device being used, you go, that's a good idea. I'll do that, too.
*  It's exactly the same with language. So you can't build linguistic concepts, which are the kind of concepts we're mostly talking about in cognitive science.
*  You can't build that kind of concept without getting your data from interaction.
*  Your data that you use to build up a concept of like dog, for example, or any other of the thousands of concepts we have.
*  Is shaped by the evidence you get from how people use words and how they respond to how words get used.
*  And most of the concepts are different in most of the languages that exist.
*  So that to me is a very powerful point about the primacy of communication and the primacy of social interaction in thinking causally about linguistic concepts.
*  So agency is central to your conception of what language is the function of language.
*  That's right. Yeah, it is.
*  And that you can take that to simply mean.
*  We do stuff with language, and that's really a big piece of what I want to say is that you use language to create effects in the world,
*  and then your effects become you can track the success or not of those effects and you can refine language on that basis and become better at it.
*  I think a lot of what we talk about when we talk about.
*  Cognition and kind of internal processes.
*  Is very often about action anyway, so.
*  I mean, a couple of examples.
*  Classic kind of William James definition of cognition saying, you know, you have higher cognition to the extent that you can consider different means to want to an end that you can.
*  You know, Romeo seeks Juliet and the door is locked, so he has higher cognition and he can find different ways to get to her by using his intellect.
*  So we talk about that as being something kind of mental, but it's necessarily mapped onto action.
*  He's thinking about these different possibilities precisely because he wants to make a decision and undertake an action towards a goal in the world.
*  So that's kind of one example to me, cognition generally is is equally all about action, right?
*  I mean, that's what it drives and then actions and their outcomes.
*  What provide evidence that allows you to kind of update your concepts and your kind of, you know, reweight aspects of kind of how your reasoning works and so on.
*  Another example related more closely to languages is the writing of Benjamin Lee Wharf, who's always cited in connection to linguistic determinism and linguistic relativity.
*  And everyone talks about his work as being about language and thought language influences, you know, how we think.
*  But in probably his most famous paper, it's in the title of it, it's something come over the exact title, but it has thought and behavior in the title.
*  And he's just as much talking about thought as he is about behavior.
*  He's talking about actions people took, given certain linguistic inputs that led to them, you know, reasoning in certain ways that turned out to be not very smart.
*  So these were examples from people who started fires in because they misunderstood something about the situation.
*  So, I don't know, there's a there's a substance called spun limestone and people reported thinking, oh, well, that's just some kind of stone.
*  So it's not going to burn. So I'll place this, you know, very hot thing on it.
*  And then a fire starts and they surprise. And I think this is what's overlooked a lot is that language played a role there, not just in thought, but in action.
*  So a person took a decision and carried it out.
*  So that's kind of one piece of it. And the second piece of it is that they.
*  That the people in question used language in a different kind of action, which is.
*  Explaining what they did after the fact, so when they meet the insurance inspector, who is coming around saying, how did this fire start?
*  You know, who knows what decision process they went through at the time, but they're certainly using language in a particular way to to narrate what they think happened or to explain or to justify the actions that they took.
*  And they reach for language to build such an explanation.
*  So I'm going to I'm going to bring us back. I want to be sure to bring us back to the ideas in your book.
*  Maybe we'll get to some via my next line of questioning.
*  I've been past handful of episodes, we've been talking about large language models a lot, and this seems like a natural time to bring them up since agency is central to your concept of language and language as coordinating solutions to social problems.
*  What does this mean? Then I'm sure you've thought a lot about large language models.
*  What does your approach and ideas mean about how to think about what large language models are doing?
*  Yeah. I have been thinking a lot about them, and so has everyone.
*  So, you know, these are kind of sort of partly digested thoughts here.
*  I mean, they're obviously super interesting, the large language models that everyone is engaging with right now and kind of using.
*  One thing that I would always want to kind of keep in mind when thinking about something like an AI, some kind of artificial agent is that we.
*  We as interpreters of the language that such a model produces are doing a lot of the work.
*  And so, you know, you might say, well, you know, this is just an algorithm and it's spitting out something, you know, it's sort of in.
*  Some stuff went in and now some stuff comes out and you are attributing some kind of mind to that, and that's the wrong way to think about it.
*  I think what's really important is to get away from that focus on the model as an individual mind or some analog of an individual mind.
*  If you think about this in that more dynamic kind of processual way, every time that a large language model spits out a piece of output,
*  it's not just this disembodied thing, it's something that you then process.
*  And so there's this relation between the language that the model produces and your interpretation of it that that's really what we're interested in here.
*  So, you know, you as a user.
*  As an interpreter of this output, putting a whole lot of the meaning in.
*  Just in identical way to what's happening when you're just having a conversation with a real human being.
*  So you're never getting a direct download of what the person thinks or means or wants to say.
*  What's happening is that they are giving you some set of clues.
*  And then at the other end, you're making all sorts of inferences and filling in intentions and filling in kind of,
*  you know, information that actually wasn't expressed, but that you think you can infer based on what they said.
*  So it's a kind of classic kind of inferential model of language understanding.
*  And we apply that to these models and it feels very natural and it works really well.
*  So I think, you know, there's a great sort of functionality to it.
*  The big difference, of course, is that.
*  It's really about the social relational element to how you relate to that particular agent as an agent.
*  OK, so foundationally, one of the big things I argue is that and in other work as well.
*  Is that when you're using language and you're using it to to carry out social actions,
*  there's this big piece to the process, which we I typically refer to as accountability.
*  And so this is something that is. Big in the kind of micro sociology of language.
*  I published a book recently with Jack Sidnell called Consequences of Language,
*  where we focus on this kind of accountability piece.
*  And what this is about is looking at how language forges social relationships and how it sets up kind of, let's say.
*  Well, I'd say accountability, reciprocity of sort of roles and so on between people and language
*  is what allows you to really set up your personal relationships and maintain them.
*  Now, when it comes to an AI, you know, what's your relationship with that thing?
*  Well, you don't have that kind of accountability or it doesn't have that kind of accountability in some sense.
*  It's a very different dynamic.
*  And I think that. We're just at the beginning of learning how to actually interact with that kind of with that kind of an entity.
*  And I think we're we're probably making all sorts of errors just because the natural thing to do is to treat it like any other agent.
*  But I think that we're going to adjust and adapt very quickly.
*  I've been talking about this a bit in relation to the to the.
*  Images, so, you know, mid journey photographic imagery now, I mean, it seems like this has happened in the last five minutes.
*  You know, in terms of how fast this is going.
*  So you better get this podcast up quickly before everything goes out of date.
*  But now we're getting these what seem to be incredibly realistic looking photographs that can be generated by AI.
*  And there's all this panic about, oh, we're going to be constantly tricked by deep fakes and that kind of thing.
*  But, you know, I was saying to someone the other day, what has to happen is a simple psychological shift that we no longer look at a photograph and go, oh, that's a real thing that happened with photographing it.
*  But rather, let's say I did a little cartoon of Donald Trump getting arrested and I showed it to you and I say, look, Trump got arrested.
*  You'd be like. So you say it's your little cartoon.
*  But if I do a fake news website and I go, look, is this wonderful looking photograph, you're going to get tricked much more easily.
*  But I think that's going to change very quickly and it should.
*  That's where we will simply recalibrate and change from instantaneously taking treating that thing as treating that image in this case, the way that we've treated photographs 50 years ago to just changing how we process them.
*  So that is something that happens at our end.
*  And that's the kind of change.
*  That's the kind of adjustment that we'll need to make with large language models is really adjust at our end how we digest this kind of input.
*  But aren't we so what you're saying is, in essence, we're going to become less gullible.
*  And it seems like we've become more gullible over time in the modern day.
*  You know, going back to the idea of two people interacting right.
*  And they're using language to sort of coordinate around some problem, you know, the dog in the backyard or something.
*  And so I kind of picture a problem.
*  Yes, there's a it's not a symmetric flow of influence.
*  There's always like one person influencing the other more.
*  Right. I mean, in general.
*  But with an AI, I worry, you know, where is that flow of influence?
*  Right. And and how does that fit within coordinating around solving a social problem?
*  So that was kind of three different topics to throw at you there.
*  Well, I think I mean, accountability is something that I would kind of often come back to.
*  So if if we are in the house and I say, hey, there's a dog in the backyard.
*  And then you go out and look and there isn't one.
*  Or, you know, it's a sheep or something.
*  I'm accountable for what I've said to you.
*  It's like, it's not a dog.
*  It's a sheep or, you know, there's no dog.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Yeah. So it seems like a trivial case, but it's really important because I in a regular
*  interaction, I am accountable in that sense for what I for what I've said that I make a claim.
*  You understand that you act on it.
*  And if it turns out to be real, you know, you're not going to be able to do that.
*  If it turns out to be wrong, you can say, well, you misled me or that's not accurate or you lied or, you know,
*  why say that there's some sort of problem of inappropriateness.
*  And then because of it, you might update or there may be some, you know, that we update our relationship or whatever.
*  You can imagine sort of.
*  All the consequences of the accountability of things we say, and that's why we tend not to kind of lie.
*  It's why we tend to be pretty conservative in how we speak to the people around us, because we're trying to maintain these
*  relationships, something like an AI or also maybe a news outlet.
*  It's completely impersonal in that sense.
*  So maybe with a news outlet, you do have an accountability in the sense that I can withdraw my subscription.
*  I mean, there's a kind of some cost that can be paid.
*  But with something like a large language model, it's this completely impersonal thing.
*  And you just don't have that kind of coordination that is like, let's put it another way.
*  It doesn't really have any skin in the game.
*  I mean, you're just kind of using it in some way.
*  So maybe that addressed part of what you're saying.
*  I think the other thing is when we talk about gullibility.
*  You know, that's it's a very sort of.
*  That, I think, kind of draws on this conduit metaphor that, you know, there's a there's a message here.
*  It comes over to me.
*  I unpack it. Do I do I accept it or not kind of thing?
*  And I think there's much more I keep trying to emphasize this with the relation between the sort of sender and receiver is not it's sending and receiving is not the best way to think about it, because it's really about a joint activity.
*  So I tend to think of, you know, I'm using more and more the term calibration that you're kind of getting calibrated to each other.
*  And language, of course, is a big technology for calibration.
*  And, you know, that's how it works.
*  And we have that's what we have to learn it.
*  And then we can save all this time by kind of because we're all intercalibrated within the community to some tolerable degree.
*  So learning a new medium is like knowing a new person or going to a new culture in some sense that you're you've got to get calibrated.
*  And we're just, you know, we're not calibrated very well yet.
*  I wouldn't think to the functionality of, let's say, a lot of eyes, but we will be soon because, you know, a lot of us will make errors and update our understanding and figure out how to how to benefit.
*  It is interesting.
*  You said meeting new people and calibrating with the new person.
*  So I meet Jessica and she seems real nice and I want to be her friend.
*  So I'm more prone to calibrate with Jessica through language, et cetera.
*  But I won't have the choice with an AI.
*  Right. And because they're going to be a very certain way.
*  I mean, I don't know how the varieties of quote unquote personalities that will be, you know, do you get to choose what kind of personality you want to interact with with your chat?
*  GPT or chat bot AI.
*  And then how will that affect?
*  So let's say and we can bring in things like Siri.
*  Right. So a lot of what you talk right about in the book is not just written language, but spoken language and the dynamics of our speech.
*  And so maybe we'll come back to that.
*  But, you know, things of that nature, when people talk to Siri, Siri doesn't adjust the way she speaks to you based on your emotions or how excited you are about a concert that you want to get tickets to.
*  Or something.
*  And I would I would assume that an AI like a chat written language based application also would doesn't co calibrate.
*  You're not co calibrating because so then you're always calibrating to it.
*  It has no cat accountability, no skin in the game.
*  Right. And I also just wonder how that's going to affect if we are going to become more skeptical of a fake picture or fake text or something.
*  Will that affect how our skeptic our skepticism with other live agents as well?
*  You know, how is that going to affect the dynamics of society and language and so on?
*  It seems unlikely they would affect, you know, our calibrate, you know, our understanding of live agents.
*  I mean, people are really. Smart and very discerning and very much able to move.
*  You know, we're a kind of fish and fusion species in a radical way.
*  We we we can create little groups that we break in and form other groups than we break and form other groups who do it all throughout the day constantly.
*  So every time we like move from, you know, we have a meeting over in this room with these people and then you go to have lunch with someone.
*  You're changing your calibration is very, very subtle kind of ways.
*  And so we're adept at that. We're good at that.
*  And I think we're very good at kind of learning how to shift between diets and updating what we want things to mean and what we regard as being appropriate and inappropriate in this kind of context.
*  In terms of, you know, let's say flexibility of calibration.
*  I think what you say is true about certain, I don't know, serious, something like that.
*  It's just always the same and it kind of has no emotion and all the rest of it.
*  There's certainly, I think, a lot of work out there going on that aims to achieve this kind of calibration with AI.
*  So, I mean, there's an app, I think it's called replica, where you set up a, you know, a friend and then.
*  It's cumulative. So this friend gets to know, you know, you chat with it all the time and it, you know, it you build up a relationship.
*  So it's kind of like a fake friend or whatever.
*  And you can very much specify who it is, what they're like, what they look like.
*  And then they learn who you are.
*  And over time, you build up this relationship.
*  So it's a lot of people find that creepy.
*  And I can understand why, because deep down, you know, it isn't.
*  Another person in some sense.
*  I mean, it's maybe like a pet or something like that.
*  So it's good for some people and other people don't really like it.
*  And probably even me saying that pet lovers are kind of like, yeah, you're going to get in trouble.
*  Yeah.
*  So your puppy dog in the background.
*  Yeah.
*  Just before.
*  But I think something that's important is, you know.
*  Transparency and sort of an appropriateness to what we actually know about the nature of this.
*  Of this agent.
*  So thinking, for example, about.
*  Navigation.
*  Bots in cars, right?
*  So you're in your car, you've got your phone there and it's telling you.
*  When I turn left and turn right, things like that.
*  And you're talking to sometimes.
*  What's that?
*  And you're probably talking to it saying, I don't want to go that, you know, using language.
*  You could be talking to it.
*  It's not it doesn't care what you say.
*  Yeah.
*  But what I was thinking about was the relation between its instructions and your actions.
*  So the let's say, so sometimes if I'm going to, let's say, go to point A in the car.
*  I don't know where point A is exactly.
*  I don't know how to get there exactly.
*  So I put it into my phone.
*  But first I have to drop off someone at, you know, some other place that I do know the way to.
*  So the first part of the journey, I keep taking turns that are not the ones that the
*  navigation is telling me to take.
*  I just go and go left.
*  But instead I go right.
*  And then it has to redo its little instruction and says, okay, go left now.
*  But I go straight ahead.
*  And all it does is it just silently recalculates and gives me a new instruction.
*  But of course, if it was a real person sitting in the seat next to me to be going,
*  hey, I said turn left.
*  What are you doing?
*  I said, go straight ahead.
*  What's up?
*  So it would be questioning me.
*  It would be, and then it would be getting mad at me.
*  Probably it's saying you're wasting my time.
*  You know, or are you okay?
*  It may be actually now.
*  Yeah.
*  I fell over the other day.
*  My watch said, should I call the emergency line?
*  So, you know, you get these maybe now at some point apps will say, you know,
*  have you been on drugs or something like that?
*  Are you having a stroke?
*  Yeah.
*  But my point is that if you that I am, I don't really want the app to be saying those things to me.
*  I know that it's just a robot and I know what I've programmed it to do.
*  And I don't care that it has to recalculate the route on the way because I've taken a different
*  turn.
*  And so the transparency there is clear, you know, and I think there's a lot of cases in
*  which because we transparently know this is not a human being that we are accountable to,
*  you know, that I don't want to be held accountable to it.
*  I don't want to be told, oh, you're not taking the turn I told you to take.
*  And if you started programming AIs to do that kind of thing, people would be like,
*  yeah, this either it creeps me out or it annoys me or, you know, so I think this is all part of
*  the idea that humans are excellent at relationships.
*  We're excellent at calibrating our understanding and also calibrating things like what's required
*  of us and what's appropriate.
*  So, you know, take just in everyday life, forget computers and stuff, you go back 5,000 years,
*  you'd have the same thing with certain people in our lives.
*  We can talk about certain topics and with other people, we wouldn't talk about those topics.
*  Right.
*  So if something like, I don't know, medical condition or something like that,
*  you know, if you're talking to a total stranger, you're probably not very likely to start talking
*  about that than if you are talking to your immediate family member.
*  So we're very good at calibration and I don't think that AIs should,
*  you know, pose any threat to that.
*  We just need to learn the different agents that are now in our landscape.
*  For the very end of your book, you make the claim that we need to essentially
*  strive to get our language right because all language is bias and influence and framing.
*  A, should we, so that has a normative flavor and is that the way language works and or should work?
*  Should we be trying to engineer the right kind of language?
*  And the reason I'm asking this now is because I'm also just wondering about the effect that
*  that AI generated language will have on our society and culture and language moving forward.
*  Yeah. When you say, should we be trying to engineer, you know, there's
*  different scales or different levels at which you could ask that question.
*  So if you mean, should we be trying to engineer language, regulate it, you know, get
*  someone in the government to make decisions about how to say things?
*  I think the answer is no, because like, who is this person going to be and
*  whose interests are they going to be representing and, you know, will they be making good decisions?
*  So for me, if the question of engineering is about something like regulating, I think no,
*  I think no, because going back to the gatekeeper point I made earlier on,
*  it's really about us as individuals being mindful. I mean, you can't, mindfulness is for minds.
*  It's not something that you can kind of make happen at a level far above that or any level
*  above that. So the engineering that has to happen, and yes, engineering must happen, it's
*  at the level of us as individuals. So as a producer of language, engineering would be
*  just deciding what to say and how to say it. That's what we do every time we open our mouths.
*  And part of the kind of mindfulness that I want to advocate is about just being aware of that
*  and thinking about that and thinking, well, okay, I'm going to say something, what's the right way
*  to say it? Now, sometimes we do, I mean, I think all of us have the experience of consciously
*  thinking about that. How am I going to say this thing I want to say? What are the best words to
*  use? But oftentimes, you know, the words just come out. So as a producer, I think we can be
*  more mindful than we are. And it's always about picking the right balance. You simply can't kind
*  of overthink everything and it wouldn't be efficient, wouldn't be useful. The other part
*  though of engineering, I don't know if engineering really applies in this other part, but the other
*  piece of this that's just as important is from the comprehension side. So when a bit of language
*  comes in, you don't take it at face value, just like you no longer want to take a video or a photo
*  on a website at face value. You want to think, okay, they said it like that. Why did they say
*  it like that? Now, when I put it like that, it seems cynical, it seems kind of like untrusting
*  in some way. And that's not how, you know, sometimes it might be like that, but that's not,
*  this can be a very cooperative way to think as well. So, you know, it's about thinking,
*  what does this person want? Is that something that I also want? So oftentimes miscommunication
*  is about missing those cues. It's about not seeing why someone said something in that way.
*  And the clues come from things like the available choices that they had. So we always have different
*  ways of saying the same thing. And we refer to that difference as difference in framing. And
*  I think that being more aware of framing, being more sort of literate in some sense,
*  mindful is just a crucial rule of thumb. And it's really, to me, one of the most important
*  aspects of cognitive literacy. When people talk about things like media literacy, I think that's
*  ultimately what they are talking about. And it goes far beyond media. It's about really just
*  a communication of any kind.
*  Going back to, you know, you talk at length in the book about spoken language as well,
*  like I alluded to before. And one of the things that you write about is Dunbar's concentric
*  circles. So, which I didn't know about. So there's Dunbar's famous number. Is it 150? I forget.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's about the number of people you can actively maintain in your social group. But the
*  concentric circle idea is that you have around seven that you regularly communicate on a regular
*  basis and ask how their health is and things like that. And then, you know, there's a little bit,
*  the next circle out has more people in it and you have a kind of a different relationship with them.
*  You know, you exchange a narrower range of words. And the example that you give in the book is,
*  one of the examples is a party where the person who answered the door was being recorded.
*  And when I think her name, I don't know what her name was. Let's say it was Sally. When Sally
*  answers the door and it's her friend Beatrice, she goes, hi. And, you know, it's like really long.
*  And Beatrice kind of says hello over, you know, over the top of her. And then later when Jim
*  comes to the door and she doesn't know Jim very well, she says hello, like kind of much quicker,
*  you know, and those relate to where you are on within the hierarchy of the concentric circles
*  within Dunbar's number. And it made me again, think about, you know, Siri and how Siri is,
*  you know, always, I guess, toward the outermost ring would be in the outermost rings of those
*  numbers. And I suppose what you're saying is that we shouldn't worry too much because we won't,
*  our interaction with these kinds of gadgets, whether it's spoken or written,
*  doesn't, won't really interfere with that kind of cognition, that social cognition of ours.
*  No, not as long as we have a life. You know, I think that
*  I think that Dunbar's point is that, you know, any human is in a social network. And within
*  that social network, I mean, the network is, is made up of, of relationships. So, you know,
*  dyadic relationships fundamentally. And so you should, any individual person should be able to
*  count up who are the people that they have a relationship with. And then you can characterise
*  differences between those kinds of relationships. And that's part of what the Dunbar's work for many
*  years has sort of been mapping out. And that is that you can, you can create these kind of groups
*  that, that you have in your life. And those people, there are different implications for how you would
*  act in accordance with those people. That's kind of what you were summarising just before.
*  Language plays a big role in that. If you don't maintain those social groupings,
*  you know, then you really can't survive in some important sense. I mean, you know, you literally,
*  the innermost circle of your social world is, is very often defined with things like, you know,
*  those are the people who would bail you out if there was a, if you had a real problem. Those are
*  the people that would drop everything and go to help you if you had a health crisis, things like
*  that. And so that's not just a fun way of defining who are the people and you're in a circle. That's
*  a very real consequence of being in someone's inner circle. So you have certain people who are
*  that to you and you are that to certain other people. So that really is about accountability.
*  So you being in that circle and having entitlements with respect to others in that
*  circle also means that you have obligations. And that's what relationships are all about.
*  And when it comes to things like Siri, well, you know, what are your entitlements? They're very,
*  very different in kind. I mean, your entitlement is that you can pose a question to Siri anytime
*  and it doesn't matter what it is and they'll just answer it. You don't have to say hello.
*  You don't have to say goodbye. There's all these different rules around how you interact,
*  but people in your real life, that's not possible. You can't ring someone up at three in the morning
*  and say, you know, how long would it take me to drive to New York? And then they tell you,
*  you know, it wouldn't work. So they're just a whole, every one of those concentric circles
*  of Dunbar's is about a set of entitlements and obligations in social relationships. And if,
*  you know, and language has everything to do with enacting and defining what those kinds of
*  entitlements and obligations are. And artificial agents are just, you know, a very different kind
*  of beast when it comes to our social relationships. All right. Well, I really appreciate, despite my
*  scatterbrained questions, the book, I highly recommend it. And it's much more organized
*  than my questions were today. So I appreciate it. Okay. Well, I appreciate it, Nick. Thanks for being
*  on. No problem. Thanks for having me.
