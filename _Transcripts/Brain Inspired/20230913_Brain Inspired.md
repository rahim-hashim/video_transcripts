# BI 174 Alicia Juarrero: Context Changes Everything
**Brain Inspired:** [September 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVmz3r1dSzg)
*  How on earth can I argue for a local science? I'm going to be laughed out of the room if
*  I argue for a local science.
*  But this is kind of what Bill Wimsatt hints at in the causal ticket, right?
*  Thank you, thank you, thank you. It seems to me that what those folk psychology terms
*  mean, represent, are what dynamical system theorists would call the constraint regime
*  that holds the dynamics together.
*  The next stage of this is going to be a study of all the different modes of constraint that
*  are all operating simultaneously.
*  This is Brain Inspired. Hey everyone, I'm Paul.
*  Alicia Juarero is a philosopher and has been interested in complexity science for a long
*  time. In her own words, since before complexity was cool. I like that.
*  In this episode we discuss many of the topics and ideas. In her new book, Context Changes
*  Everything, How Constraints Create Coherence, the book makes the thorough case that constraints
*  should be given way more attention when trying to understand complex systems like brains
*  and minds. How they're organized, how they operate, how they're formed, how they're
*  maintained, etc.
*  So as you probably know, modern science, thanks in large part to the success of physics, focuses
*  on or mostly on a single kind of causation. The kind involved when one billiards ball
*  strikes another billiard ball. But that kind of causation neglects what Alicia argues are
*  the most important features of complex systems, the constraints that shape the dynamics and
*  possibility spaces of systems.
*  Much of Alicia's book describes the wide range of types of constraints that we should be
*  paying attention to and how they interact and mutually influence each other. I highly
*  recommend the book and you may want to read it before, during, and after our conversation.
*  It's partly because, if you're like me, the concepts that we discuss still aren't comfortable
*  to think about in terms of normal modes of explanation in science. Thinking across levels
*  of organization turns out to be hard. You might also want the book handy because hang
*  on to your hats, we also jump around a lot among many of the concepts that are in our
*  book.
*  The Context Changes Everything comes almost 25 years, almost a quarter of a century after
*  her previous classic, Dynamics in Action, which we also discuss and which I also recommend,
*  especially if you want more of a primer to her new, more expansive work. These ideas
*  touch on all things complex, of course, from self-organizing systems like whirlpools to
*  businesses, societies, and of course, minds and brains. Find the show notes at braininspired.co
*  slash podcast slash 174. I'm sure you could tell I very much enjoyed this conversation.
*  We also have some guest questions from friends of the podcast, Kevin Mitchell, who's also
*  coming up on a near future episode about his new book, and Max Schein from Down Under.
*  Thanks for listening. Here's Alicia.
*  Context Changes Everything is almost a quarter of...
*  It's Cuban hyperbole.
*  Oh, what does that mean?
*  Humans tend to exaggerate. I probably should have said context changes most things or a lot of things.
*  Well, I was going to tie it to your previous work, Dynamics in Action, which is now almost a quarter
*  of a century old. And so what you could say about that is that context changes action
*  is a very coarse and terrible summary of that classic now work. And so I was thinking maybe
*  context changes everything is just kind of an expansion on those ideas.
*  Yeah, it really is. It really is. After I wrote that one, I thought, well, I've got nothing else to say.
*  But you know, there's been so many issues. And one of the things is people said to me,
*  you know, there's nothing that's context free. I'd use that term in that one.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's true. So what do I call it? Well, what about context? It depends. So I'm thinking maybe I
*  gave short shrift to that one, to that kind of constraint. And so, you know, things start...
*  And of course, AI and language models and so on. And 4E, I think, came out of the process.
*  So there were a lot of things that I thought once the pandemic started, I thought, you know what,
*  just sit down and do it, you know, and just put it all together and see if it comes together.
*  And I was pleased it did.
*  Yeah, me too. I mean, you mentioned the phrase context free, which you have changed
*  now to context dependent in the new book.
*  Independent.
*  Oh, that's the context, right, context independent. Yeah, see, that's what I was going to say is,
*  you know, I love the book. It is challenging and one that I will have to revisit over and over
*  because, well, no, it's not bad. So I'm already, that's not a bad thing. I'm already a slow reader
*  and I'm a slow thinker, apparently, as well, at least to get any depth.
*  I'm a poor writer is what I am. I don't write very clearly. I don't know why I'm good in the
*  classroom, but I'm terrible. I just, it looks still, I spent most of my time just editing.
*  Sure.
*  Well, that's what, so what I want to ask you is, what's changed in your views since Dynamics in
*  Action? And, you know, besides just expanding, you know, you cover like so many different
*  constraints and topics in this book. But what I wanted to comment on before that is one of the
*  reasons why I'm going to have to go back to it over and over is because the terminology and
*  is you're like inventing some of it. And a lot of it is kind of still for me,
*  still fuzzy in terms of like what, what it actually like it's, it's definition and how,
*  like how I set the boundaries, you know, with these terms and what they mean and how I can use
*  them. And so, you know, and we'll come back to this. But anyway, that's why I'm going to be
*  revisiting a lot. So maybe let's start with, you know, what's changed in 25 years in your thinking.
*  I think what's changed is that when I wrote Dynamics in Action, I basically meant it as a
*  brief against analytic action theory. Okay. Can you can you summarize analytic action?
*  The idea that that either that intentional behavior, intentional action, you know,
*  the book starts with what's the difference between a wink and a blink, right? Difference being that
*  you should be able to explain a way, anything that philosophy of mind considers
*  intentionality or intention. So teleology was
*  reduced away. The idea of contentful intentions were reduced away. And so my thought was, because
*  I had published a number of standalone papers about what's wrong with behaviorist reductions
*  of intention, what's wrong with with identity theory attempts to reduce intentions is on that
*  complex dynamical systems theory was a very good way of entering this whole field that would solve
*  a lot of the problems and wouldn't get you into the problems that all these other attempts did.
*  But in the last 20 some years, I keep thinking, you know, most stuff in reality is irreversible,
*  most stuff is context. So it applies not just to action, but it applies a lot more broadly. And so
*  I think I stick my neck out a bit more with respect to general ontology or general cosmology
*  by using the same notion of constraint. Yeah, more broadly than just for action.
*  Yeah. Well, I had to revisit dynamics in action. As you know, and as you write about in your newer
*  book, Context Changes Everything, neuroscience has embraced the dynamical systems perspective.
*  And you talk about some of the studies that, you know, some of the people who have been in
*  those studies have been on this podcast. And on this podcast, we talk a lot about the dynamical
*  systems view. And then going back to dynamics in action, it's like, oh, my God, it's all there
*  already. I mean, thank you. It's fascinating to me that somebody like Mark Churchland, who I
*  use in one of the chapters, is the son of Paul and Patricia Churchland, who were the
*  foremost advocates of the eliminative. Right. Oh, I didn't even think of that.
*  Because this thing is as a mind, I'm thinking, oh, my goodness, this is the revenge for excellence
*  of dynamical systems theory. Because I once met Paul Churchland here in DC, Dick Schlegel at GW,
*  and invited him to speak. And I asked him back then, this must have been, this must have been
*  just about when dynamics came up. I was years ago. And I haven't ever considered dynamical
*  systems theory. That has nothing to say about neurology or the mind.
*  Really? Oh, huh.
*  Paul Churchland said that in person, and I've never forgotten. I'm thinking,
*  no. And the reason I was almost sure that was so is because way back when I was talking a lot
*  to people in operations research and network theory and that kind of thing. And like, you know
*  what, there's got to be a network property in the brain that has emergent properties that somehow
*  loops back down and is able to influence behavior such that these emergent properties get realized
*  in behavior. That's the difference between an action proper and behavior. There's got to be
*  some of that. But no, I think that just traditional notions of causality, traditional notions of
*  ontology, that only the tiny little fundamental components are real. So it was all, let's look
*  for the neuron. It does this, yeah. So I find it really, really very rewarding that dynamical
*  systems theory has been vindicated in a sense. Yeah. I wonder what the elder Churchlands,
*  their daughter is also in neuroscience, by the way. I wonder what they think of the dynamo. I
*  wonder if they've come around at all because the tagline sort of eliminativism is that folk
*  psychology, the words that we use in folk psychology aren't real things, right? And then
*  there's a reductionist way to understand things and that's the best way. But the dynamo, the
*  dynamical systems viewpoint kind of, it's kind of in between that, right? Because it allows for a
*  top-down thing, but it doesn't necessarily say anything about the terms and concepts we use.
*  Well, that's why I think I stick my neck out in this one, where it seems to me that what those
*  folk psychology terms mean, represent are what dynamical system theorists would call the constraint
*  regime that holds the dynamics together. And so they are capturing an emergent property
*  that is powerful. And that's where the whole problem of causality kept bugging me because
*  I'm thinking, Carl Gillette's book on reduction and emergence where he says, you know, nowadays,
*  the physicists, like Brian Laughlin, for example, have espoused the truth or the reality of emergent
*  properties, but they still don't want to allow that those emergent properties are causally
*  influential on their components. In other words, they cannot change behavior. They cannot change
*  in a sense neural architecture in virtue of their emergent properties. Whereas that's what I think
*  complex dynamical systems lets you do. Maybe we could just segue into causality.
*  I do that a lot. No, that's great. I do that a lot.
*  You'll have to, I do it too. So we're going to be in a real swamp here pretty soon.
*  But you know, so one of the things in dynamics and action also is, you know, you've railed against
*  this modern notion of efficient causation as the only valid kind of causation. And since you're
*  just talking about causality, maybe we should talk about that. And then I want to come back to also
*  what you have changed your mind about perhaps since then. But so, you know, famously, there
*  are these four different types of causations from Aristotle's days from Aristotle and an efficient
*  causation, the billiard ball, the thing X hits things Y and then that moves things thing Y.
*  That's the only valid kind of causation. And a lot of your labor is trying to bring back notions
*  of the other of formal causality and causality via constraint. And so do you think that and
*  from my limited perspective, because I'm reading works like yours, and like a lot of similar kinds
*  of works that are trying to bring make teleology not such a bad word and bring like these constraints
*  to bear. Because of that, I feel like the old story, the modern story of efficient causation
*  is the only causation. I feel like that's dissipating. Do you believe that also?
*  I think it's still very present in in physics, especially with regards to the kind of causality
*  that we would call top down causality, that in fact, emergent properties really are not causally
*  powerful, that all the heavy lifting, as Van Orden would say, it all happens bottom up. And so it's
*  really to be explained through efficient energetic transfer. But I think that's because
*  the idea of causality as efficient boxes you into the impossibility of top down causation,
*  of top down causation, because if there were top down causation with that kind of causality,
*  you'd have over determination, you'd have a violation of the closure of the physical,
*  and you'd have all these problems. And so therefore, knowing that can't happen.
*  Well, but if you think of but what I found fascinating, it's one of the reasons why I
*  adopted the notion of constraint was every time natural scientists, hard scientists
*  got into trouble thinking in terms of efficient causality, then immediately the term starts being
*  used as well, it's factors or conditions or constraints that are causal. Well, okay, so I'll
*  grant you efficient causality as the term for cause. So let's call it influenced by constraint.
*  And that's what I was trying to do, because I certainly don't want to go to
*  an Elan Vital notion of formal cause. I don't want to go to, you know, Deus Ex Machina, or,
*  or you know, Paley's teleology, or even Aristotle's teleology, which was all built in,
*  set up from the beginning. That's the way God, that's why, that's why Darwin,
*  Darwin bought into this. And so Darwin thought he was very concerned about the notion of evolution
*  because they have new species appearing, that that would mean that it wasn't all built in from the
*  start. And therefore, this developmental process was only an unfurling of pre existing potential.
*  And what I want to say is that constraints really create new potential, because I think that's what
*  you get from prigogine. I think that's what prigogine gets the, he was the good prigogine
*  now that we think about it. He was the one who he got the Nobel Prize for dissipated structures,
*  I think for that very reason. But you mentioned physics, and maybe it's just in biology that the
*  notion of circular causality and causality via constraint is more comfortable among biologists.
*  I think the biologists, biology was the last holdout. They refused to get shoehorned
*  into the model of efficient mechanical causality. And as I was reading your email, and reading one
*  of the latest issues of Science Magazine on Australia, you know, they're talking about the
*  dispersal of distribution of black beans throughout Australia. And the assumption was, well,
*  this precedes the Westerners who arrived in Australia. But now they're revisiting the idea
*  that some of the songlines of the native Australians have accounts of these plants,
*  and the dispersion. So the Science Magazine article talks about combining not only the genetic
*  flow of the genes of the black bean plant, but also biogeography, and these ethnographic accounts.
*  So I think that you see it now more in ecology, in addition to just straight biology, but you see it.
*  And of course, the social scientists have always used other causal factors as their reasons. But
*  of course, that's what led the hard scientists to say, well, that proves they're not sciences,
*  social scientists. Because they need to appeal to unique causes, to things that don't
*  scale as a universal law. And because they use top down factors that are not efficient causes,
*  that shows for sure they're not science. Before maybe this can just be a jumping off point to
*  any of these can be jumping off points, because we can go any direction. But have you changed
*  your mind about anything in particular with regard to the story of context and constraints
*  over the last quarter century? No, I think I focus more on context independent constraints,
*  because what I think that does... And hang on, I'll just say context independence means it's an
*  external constraint that drives a system far from equilibrium, like a gradient or gravity,
*  etc. It pulls on the system. Like gradient particularly. And when you start looking at
*  the different kinds of gradients, either the spatial temporal gradients of gravity,
*  the gravitational... I like that you just illustrated gravity right there.
*  That means that space time is not homogeneous in uniform. There are inhomogeneities in space and
*  time. Polarities. We know the importance of polarities all over the place. We have polarities
*  in electric and magnetic, but also in developmental anterior posterior, right and left in the
*  development of an embryo. I think in social systems, we certainly have levels of organization
*  that would give you different points of equilibrium at different stages. So I think
*  the importance of that, the importance of boundary conditions, I think, as a setting for a context.
*  Basically, I think of context independent constraints as those that determine, in a sense,
*  bounds of possibility space. They kind of determine the basic fundamental characteristics
*  of possibility space. But you need both context independent and context dependent, and I'll just
*  briefly define context dependent constraints, which bring things back essentially away from
*  context independence, which means more toward equilibrium. And when you get these mixing and
*  matching, maybe not. I know, I know, I just caught myself saying more toward equilibrium,
*  but away from independence, we'll say maybe that's correct. Yeah. But when you get these
*  interacting is when you can have the ability to develop complex systems. I think the reason I
*  had given context free context, independent constraints short shrift back when is because
*  I don't think context independent constraints complexify. They don't enable complexity.
*  All you get in principle would be a clump. Correct? They would match.
*  At the poles. Yeah.
*  Clumps and masses and agglomerations have no emergent properties. So context independent
*  constraints don't create complexity. Once you have a space of possibilities with a certain
*  inhomogeneity in it, then I think complex dependent constraints can kick in.
*  My question is, why do they show up? Why do context dependent constraints appear? And I'm
*  wondering whether again, the boundary conditions if the clumps are dense enough, and they can't
*  move much, then do accidental linkages.
*  The indeterminism? Are you hinting at indeterminism in the universe?
*  Even the bumps and jostlings of regular Brownian motion that if there, I always try to ground
*  what I say in in hard sciences. And I always end up going back to things like the bannard cells in
*  the bZ reaction. Otherwise, I'm very worried that philosophers will be accused of flights of fancy
*  that are not grounded in anything scientific. And so I keep thinking, all right, so you've got
*  bannard cells and a pan of water, heated uniformly from below, and at a certain threshold of non
*  equilibrium, in other words, at a certain gradient, correct? The status quo cannot be
*  maintained. In other words, conduction cannot be maintained. And so the system flips to
*  linking individual water molecules into local perturbation. But if that gets amplified by the
*  conditions, then it becomes a self reinforcing feedback loop. And that's, I think, where you see
*  the context dependent constraint kicking in that then the linkages create standalone units.
*  Almost like when you're playing hangman, you know, we know that instinctively, because if we have
*  towards the end of a word that we don't know what that is a T, and then an I,
*  well, there are two more to go. Well, it's either going to be ng or o n, because these form like
*  standalone units, because they the context dependence concatenates and becomes a standalone
*  unit. And now you've got in language, you'd have a phoneme. Right. But in in that's what a laser is,
*  a laser is context dependent constraints of a whole bunch of photon streams, getting linked
*  together in a way that they become a standalone entity with emergent properties. Yeah, so you're
*  talking about and you just mentioned why you use these examples, because they're less dangerous,
*  I suppose, because they're, in some sense, simpler, more, more, I'm gonna say low dimensional,
*  because they're like from physics, so it feels more comfortable. Maybe that's a way to say it.
*  But but you do venture into these more, you know, like biological systems in the book. And one of
*  the questions I had for you is, so I'm glad that you're sometimes pausing just a little bit before
*  you say causality or something. Yeah, that's where immediately a physicist will say no, that's not
*  cause. Yeah, right. Right. Well, then, like, and then I don't know what's going on in your head,
*  if you're searching for a different term, because there are, you know, alternative types of terms,
*  because, you know, reading your book, and one of the reasons why I need to revisit it multiple times,
*  and I look forward to it is just because things feel so new to me, and the terminology so new,
*  that I that that I don't feel like they don't feel comfortable, right? So I'm trying to think,
*  like, how do I apply this term? And how does that? How does this concept interact with this kind of
*  constraint? And there's their interlocking dependencies? And how do I think about
*  applied to the brain? And so what I'm wondering is, are these going to feel you're the expert?
*  How do these feel super comfortable to you just switching and thinking about these things
*  interacting and the different modalities? I wish I had made I had coined the term enabling
*  constraints. It goes back to Patti, Howard Patti, and a whole bunch of these biologists who talked,
*  several of whose books have the same similar title, hierarchy theory. And it's because the
*  enabling constraint is able to create a level of self organization that can then also embed in the
*  next higher up level of constraint. So so I particularly want to use the notion of enabling
*  constraints as constraints that enable the formation of a more complex dynamic.
*  And that is, and how does that relate to a limiting constraint? Contrast that with a limiting?
*  That would be the I think, we tend to use the term constraint, especially in physics and in
*  mechanical engineering, especially as limiting as as as closing off options, but the biologists
*  tend to use them very often as factors, conditions, feedback loops, catalysts. See,
*  the nice thing about the notion of a catalyst, two things, a lot of things, one is expands chemistry
*  and biology. And now and even in so and so as a catalysts of change, and we say that of people.
*  So it's used in that sense. But also because a catalyst is conserved, it does not use up any
*  energy of its own. And so what I like about that notion is that it's a causal factor. It's a causal,
*  it's an influencer. That is not in the efficient causality mode. So our feedback loops.
*  And the thing about feedback loop, which I love is that for eons for since ours since ours on that
*  never changed, the idea of something creating itself or feeding back on itself to change itself
*  was forbidden was rebuttal. Because, again, from Aristotle's notion, then it would have to be
*  before and after itself. It would have to be before itself is cause it would be have to be
*  after itself is cause. Oh, no, you can't have that. The notion of simultaneous causality does not
*  allow for parts interacting to produce holes that have emergent properties, which then
*  simultaneously loop back down and constrain the parts of which the hole is made up.
*  And so that's why I love the notion of feedback loops and catalysts in particular. But then I
*  think once that whole coalesces, then you've got stabilizing constraints because it has to hold
*  together for a persistent length of time, because unlike near equilibrium thermodynamics, the thing
*  doesn't fall apart. The thing about these Benard cells is that while the conditions are consistent,
*  the conditions are all it holds together despite changes at the component level perturbations.
*  Yeah. So fluctuations, internal fluctuations and perturbation, it has a meta stability,
*  which I also like, which is different from thermal equilibrium of classical near equilibrium
*  thermodynamics. While the thing holds, it has a stabilizing power to stabilize the constraint
*  as a whole. And what is it? You say it has a stabilizing power. That's the whole, what is the
*  dynamic constraint regime that constitutes a Benard cell? A Benard cell is not a thing other than
*  the water molecules that make it up or the constraints that go into establishing the
*  conditions that make it up, the boundary conditions as context, independent constraints. And then the
*  linkages of the molecules. Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's just so hard to think of
*  across scales, these myriological. Yes. It's extremely difficult to think across scale,
*  because we tend to think in terms of efficient cause across scale. And all of these biologists,
*  I always wondered for a long time, why did these biologists like Stan Salty, Howard Patti,
*  a lot of them started talking about semiotics and seniorism. Why did they ever get into this?
*  And it finally dawned on me because the relationship between levels of organization,
*  and Herbert Simon knew this, the near decomposability of constraint, they're not
*  relations of energetic exchange. Right? So the higher level
*  is a form of constraint on the possibility space of the lower level. So it doesn't let it veer off
*  and disintegrate. It's interesting the word integrity fits beautifully here because it just
*  holds it together. So when I think of top down constraints, those are limiting because they
*  hold that possibility space within a dynamic range. And so the thing, an organism holds together.
*  Our metabolism might change, a spleen might be removed, a gallbladder might be removed,
*  but the constraint regime holds. Can you name something that is not an emergent property of
*  something else? Oh, culture. Culture is not an emergent property.
*  Can you name something that's not an emergency? Quantity is emergent, but it's not an interesting
*  emergence. Okay, so that's fine. No, thank you. That's a good point. When I think of emergent
*  properties, the emergent properties that I'm interested in are qualitatively different properties
*  that affect the behavior of the component level so that that qualitative property continues in
*  effect. That's why homeostasis I think of as an emergent property that has interesting
*  features because it controls the goings on at the lower level such that homeostasis,
*  homeostatic balance holds. Whereas a whole bunch of pile of debris in my backyard.
*  It's still emergent with respect to size. It's bigger, but if you throw a bowling ball into it,
*  it would be harder to move than if you just had one piece of debris out there, right?
*  That's true, but it does not change the characteristics of any of the-
*  There's no top-down. There's no-
*  Perfect. There's no top-down. See, that's what's been driving my thinking for 20-some years,
*  and that is how can you explain top-down causality without falling victim or making the mistakes of
*  El Anvital, all that other stuff. That's what I think complex dynamical systems gives me.
*  And I think the rise of ecology in the last 25 years has helped enormously because we used to
*  think, oh, well, we can kill off the plankton. That's not a big deal.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  And the thing is the understanding that it may mess up the constraint regime that holds the whole
*  thing together is the idea that there are systemic properties that really affect the
*  components. I think that's gone a long way to making us aware of top-down in a respectable
*  scientific way.
*  On the other hand, one of the features of complex self-organizing systems is their robustness. So,
*  if you did kill off all the mosquitoes, we might be okay.
*  I suspect, though, I think robustness means that they degrade gracefully.
*  I like that.
*  That it doesn't fall apart the way if you break the axle on a bicycle that will try to go whatever.
*  That will just thing won't work at all.
*  It seems as though complex dynamical systems far from equilibrium, they get a bit out of kilter,
*  but they continue to work for a fair amount of time until then it reaches its level of instability
*  that that constraint regime cannot hold.
*  New phase change coming up.
*  And you get an entirely new phase change and it falls apart. So, I suspect that if we killed off
*  all the mosquitoes, we do not know what might enter that open niche now.
*  Yeah. Well, there have been all sorts of disasters with introducing non-native species to kill off
*  one thing and it turns out they're invasive.
*  Exactly. I suspect we've got to be careful because of that kind of problem. Before the
*  thing falls apart, you might have some really nasty surprises that you didn't expect.
*  Hey, you mentioned homeostasis and again, we're going to jump around, but
*  I had Henry Yen on and I've had a few other people on who talk about the brain more as a control
*  system than necessarily a complex system.
*  That we need to think about things more in sort of the old cybernetics way of a control system.
*  However, the set point of our thermometer is not set externally.
*  We're setting our own set point, right?
*  So, homeostasis is...
*  So, what is the in certain bounds?
*  Well, that's what I was going to ask you about. How do you think about
*  when we're setting our internal desired temperature, let's say that we need to be
*  around 98.6, how do you think about that? Where does that set point come from? Bottom up,
*  top down or is it just the...
*  I think not only comes up bottom up, top down, but
*  pass forward.
*  Pass forward, environment in.
*  We forget temporal constraints as well.
*  Yeah.
*  For example, folks up in the Himalayas and in the Andes have a whole different
*  oxygen hemoglobin capacity and characteristic because of centuries of adaptability,
*  millennia of adaptability. So, we forget temporal constraints as well.
*  Yeah.
*  Right? It seems as though the same temperature in the fall feels colder than it does in the spring
*  because by the time we get to the spring, we've had a whole winter.
*  So, I think it's multi-dimensional, multi-scalar. Temporally, I think we forget time.
*  We forget. And all of these complex dynamical systems, I remember a phrase of Prigogines.
*  I was fortunate enough to meet him a couple of times and I've never seen this written down,
*  but he used to use that phrase more than once in person. They carry their history on their back.
*  Like that.
*  I love that phrase. In other words, their very dynamical architecture and characteristics
*  embody, and that's where the foreease is coming, embody the conditions under which they were
*  created, evolved, and so on. His examples were snowflakes. They might have all started with the
*  same, but over the time that they fell to earth, their actual architecture changes to embody the
*  temperature, the pressure, all the atmospheric conditions
*  through which they modify themselves and adapt it until they reach the ground.
*  So, I think that's true for us as well, for body temperature, for body states. I'm fascinated by
*  that whole note, that inflammation, all these set points that I think in a sense, those mark
*  the parameters of what you might call the constraintome.
*  You know, we've got the proteome and the-
*  Oh, there it is. There's the word, the constraintome.
*  I just, I was reading proteome and epigenome and so on. Well, you know we need a constraintome.
*  We do. That's all in your book. The constraintome is-
*  Yeah, but I've never occurred to me to use that phrase, which I like, because it's a whole bunch
*  of them together at once.
*  Right. Right. That's the problem in sort of just mentally trying to imagine these things.
*  But real quick, you mentioned temporal constraints, but in a sense, this is a question,
*  all or most constraints are temporal in nature because a constraint is by definition slower
*  than the process that it's constrained on. So, I think that's true for us as well.
*  Because a constraint is by definition slower than the process that it's constrained.
*  Like a catalyst, right, is more stable than the reaction that it's catalyzing.
*  And that's so it can act as a constraint.
*  Correct. But then the cells which enable the tissues, the cell dynamics which enable the tissues,
*  that's faster than the-
*  Yeah.
*  Then so you have a whole bunch of- Therefore, what's important are the interfaces between
*  the levels of organization. And what are the constraints that govern those interfaces?
*  And we would call them what, codes, rules, algorithms?
*  Laws.
*  Local, but local, very oftentimes very local. Right?
*  Right. Well, that's so okay, there's this, a lot of the physical laws, like the notion of a force,
*  right? For some reason, well, when you think about it, it doesn't make any sense. But for some reason,
*  when you grow up with it in physics classes and you think, oh, force, I know what a force is.
*  But when you really think about it, it becomes very unnatural, like saying the same word over
*  and over and you lose its meaning. Are these ideas going to seem as natural to me eventually
*  as the concept of a force, which is, it turns out, a slippery idea also?
*  I would hope so. But that's what I'm always worried about, about neologisms. And I worried
*  about using the word constraint, but it seemed as though-
*  What else would you call it?
*  Better than a cause because if I use the word cause, then the assumption that that has to be
*  energetic transfer, that's a losing battle. That's why. So I don't know what else to call it.
*  But to think in terms of enabling constraints is bottom up that within certain boundary,
*  within certain contexts, independent frameworks, they can generate emergent properties,
*  which in turn operate as second order top down context dependent constraints, if you will.
*  It's easier to just call them constraint regime.
*  Yeah. Okay. Regime's a good word.
*  Hold the components together so that they continue to satisfy the emergent properties of the whole.
*  Do you feel like we will be able to write a constraint cookbook to generate complex
*  systems that we want to generate eventually?
*  If we think of it as formal systems the way we used to where you would have a universal law,
*  Newton's Laws of Motion, then I think my answer is no, because if I'm emphasizing context dependence,
*  those laws would be what Karl Popper would call well, yeah, those applies to a normal science.
*  But evolution to a whole new constraint structure, to a whole new constraint regime,
*  such as the transition, I would say, from physics to chemistry, chemistry to biology, biology to
*  psychology first or sociology first or whatever you want to call it, and on and on and on.
*  That requires a whole new constraint regime. It's a topological nightmare and transition.
*  You know what's interesting? Priggeine detested catastrophe theory. I never understood why.
*  The idea that Peter Allen, who worked with him for a long time, you know Peter Allen's work?
*  Peter Allen did really nice work. He's retired now from Cranfield in England,
*  but he did a lot of work with Priggeine in Brussels at the Free University. The idea that
*  the transition from independent photon streams to a laser, the transition from
*  a independent water molecules to a benign cell, the transition from a whole bunch of
*  chemical transformations to a living organism is akin to a bifurcation, to a topological bifurcation
*  that you have entirely new coordinates that apply at this new level. That to me gives
*  reality to emergent properties. Oh, ontologically real?
*  Oh, I want to say ontologically real. I don't have to worry about tenure, so I don't have to worry
*  about retreating to epistemology where the going gets tough. That's our models and that's the way
*  we make sense of information overload. No, damn it. I want to say they are ontologically real,
*  that the constraint regime that holds a benign cell together or a culture together or a
*  laser together are real. They are not stuff. They are not things. I certainly don't want to reify them,
*  but I don't see why we don't allow the dynamical interdependencies, which is all these
*  constraint regimes are, right? They are interlocking interdependencies.
*  I thought reify meant make real.
*  Well, yeah, sure, part of it, but then only stuff stuff is real.
*  Oh, okay. Okay. So therefore, processes aren't real.
*  That's why Whitehead rails against reification because he emphasized that processes
*  are real. I want to say the constraints that keep processes within a certain
*  face space are also real. They are as real as the face space they are kept into.
*  Which one do you give? Do you give more credence to processes or are you a process
*  philosopher so to speak? That's a good question.
*  You know, dynamical systems theory seems to place, and if nothing else, equal to the links as the
*  nodes. The question of whether the nodes are condensates, Mark Bergauer uses that term,
*  the condensates of links of a lot of stable linkages.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  Nodes as stable condensates, no, as nodes are condensates of stable links or those that happen
*  very often and so on. So it's hard to say in this new book, I stick my neck out because I did not
*  realize that there's still a question about exactly what covalent bonds are.
*  Oh, yeah. I think when you dig into any established thing, there's no realize.
*  There you go. And the interconversion of matter and energy certainly says, well, you know,
*  so is a material thing simply the condensate of a bunch of constrained energy
*  forces, links and constraints, or are the forces and the links the manifestation or the behavior
*  of the, then if relativity theory is correct, which I just mean, then it doesn't matter.
*  They're interconvertible, right? But again, they're very local. I want to, I was thinking,
*  how on earth can I argue for a local science? I'm going to be laughed out of the room if I argue
*  for a local science.
*  But this is kind of what Bill Wimsatt hints at in the causal ticket, right?
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I have a sweet spot in my heart for Bill Wimsatt, even though
*  I've never met him, because I learned that he, I don't know who told me or how I learned about it.
*  He was on the committee that approved my first. Oh, theory rests on a mistake. And so I think
*  that I published that first paper so many years ago.
*  I think Wimsatt is fat, you know, and that brings in the notion of explanation. How he's been
*  arguing that sometimes explanations look upwards, not just downwards. Why? Because if you do believe
*  that there are emerging properties and they are causally constrained, with the eye roll, folks,
*  who are over-numbing.
*  Exactly. Then you have to be able to make reference in any complete explanation to
*  its influence, as well as to the influence of the bottom-up components, which is the way we tend to.
*  We always look downwards. And let me tell you, I think the reason folks like David Chalmers and
*  company, all this business about psycho, the panpsychism.
*  Panpsychism, yeah.
*  I think what's driving that is that anytime you find top-down causality, you cannot much
*  deny that's got to be mental. Well, let's put it differently. It's got to be top-down
*  and it's a constraint regime influencing its components. But I don't want to say that
*  just as chemical properties are emerging from physical, biological properties are emerging from
*  chemical, psychic properties are emerging at a certain level of organization. I don't want to
*  say that that emerging property way up at the psychic level also exists. I really don't want
*  to say the Benard cell is thinking or is conscious or is aware. But I do want to say there is a top
*  down phenomenon. I suspect that a lot of what's driving the panpsychic.
*  What would we call it? FAD?
*  I hope so. I cannot imagine that anybody's taking it seriously. I think it's a
*  paradigm. That's all I can do.
*  Let's call it paradigm to give it a little more credence than FAD.
*  No, no, no. It was a paradigm way back in the creases when I was a child.
*  I don't want to get in trouble, Alicia.
*  You've got more credence than I do. I don't want to get in trouble. But you know what?
*  Talking about that, I just spoke at the Theory of Consciousness conference in Taormina this past
*  spring. I suddenly realized I said the same thing. I talked at that conference in Antwerp
*  20-something years ago. I was left out of the room 20-something years ago.
*  I was talking about constraints and dynamical systems and so on.
*  Going, how interesting. You get a lot of this talk about constraints.
*  I mean, people were talking a lot about constraints.
*  What is the lesson from that? Because you've stuck to your guns. Did you just brush that off
*  your back? This isn't a side. It's more of a personal question because a lot of people face
*  laughter or dismissal.
*  I wasn't literally laughed out, but I was ignoring it. Nobody asked me questions and they just said,
*  it's the equivalent. People were polite, but-
*  Maybe they didn't understand it.
*  Well, I didn't explain it clearly, but I think it was just it didn't fit the standard bottom-up
*  identity theory or supervenience theory, which was what was popular at the time or
*  a limitedism, I never can say- Hard.
*  At the time. It was ignored just as, I hate to say it, absolutely.
*  Bill Bechtel, who's a nice guy and he's very good.
*  He's a new mechanist. He's a mechanisms all the way proponent.
*  Well, if you look at his mechanics, they've sort of changed. He came to Cuba. He and Adel came to
*  Cuba with me in a conference I organized in Havana years ago. I think his mechanism is not your
*  grandmother's mechanism. That's true, but he's adapted like you just said.
*  But it's sort of like, come on, Bill, just acknowledge complex dynamicals.
*  Can't do it.
*  I can't. It's hard to change your mind when you've done it so long.
*  You mentioned explanation a few minutes ago. In Dynamics in Action, I think the last chapter,
*  the next to last chapter, you make a call for the necessity of explaining these sorts of
*  myriological interactions in terms of hermeneutics or a narrative story.
*  In this newer book, I think I searched and I think hermeneutics was in there maybe once or twice,
*  but you also bring up the idea of order parameters, which are kind of like these
*  hyperparameters of dynamical systems. I'm wondering where you stand in terms of explanation.
*  My original thought was, well, if I could just list all the constraints and the types of
*  constraints and how they're interacting, is that an explanation? Do I need a narrative story? Are
*  these order parameter? What would satisfy me or a reviewer of a paper as an explanation of some
*  cognitive function, for example? Well, I used the term hermeneutics.
*  Another eye roll. Another eye roll.
*  No, I mean, I don't like myelogism, although that hermeneutics goes back to biblical exegesis.
*  Right. Well, that's, yeah, when you look it up, it's all about the Bible. But your point was
*  to go across levels, you really need to account for these things and narrative might be the only
*  way to do it. That's Cliff Gertz's notion that I borrowed that back then from Cliff Gertz, who
*  almost defined hermeneutics instead of you. It's kind of like saying you have to pack from the very
*  global to the very local, back to the global, back to the local and see how all these constraints
*  interact and change each other. And I love also the notion of mutual constraint satisfaction,
*  which is what is happening. I think probably narrative does a way better job of accomplishing
*  that than a Hempel and Oppenheimer, Hempel and Oppenheim deductive nomological model.
*  So to that extent, I don't think I've changed my tune. I just I'm not using the notion of narrative.
*  Cliff, when somebody nowadays says Proust's Madelaine's,
*  you bring up the whole constraint regime of the culture of his history of his childhood,
*  his experience of that to me is almost like an order parameter. It's a parameter in that it
*  is the intersection of a whole bunch of different independent variables that together give you a
*  whole tapestry of a whole different face, possibility space. Could you think of a concept
*  as a constraint? I think I certainly think of a concept of a constraint and a framework,
*  a cognitive framework being a whole tapestry of concepts, but in such as cognitive, it's emotional.
*  I mean, think of alfaction, and alfaction does not go directly to the cortex initially,
*  right? But I think a concept has a lot of characteristics that are important. One is
*  they're multiply realizable. That's a big theme in your book.
*  That's a big theme in my book because a triangle or triangularity as a concept
*  is multiply realizable. It's not a one-to-one capture of the individual physical features of
*  one instance. And I think that we know the child has understood the concept when they're able to
*  apply that concept to an instance they haven't seen before or they were not taught about. So I
*  think that's extremely important. I think what a local constraint regime does is it captures
*  a type, what philosophers used to call types and universals, or a concept, or what we would call
*  an emotion. Not this emotion now here. An emotion, yeah.
*  You know, this type of emotion. It's a bunch of constraint regimes that can be identified
*  with a term like fear or anger or pleasure or avoid an end approach. All these are code terms
*  to that extent, the reductions. They're code terms, but they do capture something very real,
*  and that is a whole complex constraint regime. That kind of swirls around that
*  constraint regime. That kind of swirls around this, let's say fear or something. It takes with it
*  fight or flight, etc. It's almost like a process that is itself kind of condensated, to use your
*  term earlier, but still a process and brings with it, carries with it on its back its history and
*  all of the things associated. Correct, correct, correct.
*  Yeah. Okay, so I didn't tell you this, and I know we're jumping around. I actually elicited a few
*  guest questions from previous guests. The first one I'm going to play for you, and this is kind
*  of maybe segue into a conversation about minds and brains and then later AI. The first one I'm
*  going to play to you is from Kevin Mitchell. I'm going to have him back on the podcast in a couple
*  weeks about his new book, Agents, Free Agents, How Free Will Gave Us Agency. I'll have to look
*  at it. Okay, so I'm just going to play this to you, make sure that you can hear it.
*  Hi, Alicia. This is Kevin Mitchell. I really loved your new book, which very clearly lays out the
*  case that constraints are causes. That is that the way things are organized is every bit as much of
*  a cause of how they evolve through time as the basic laws and forces of physics. In particular,
*  you highlight the really key idea of enabling constraints, especially in hierarchical systems,
*  that organizing the elements at one level can enable new kinds of properties to emerge at
*  higher levels. You say in chapter 16 that emergent properties and powers were not merely waiting to
*  be revealed. They are genuine creations of path-dependent multiple constraint satisfaction.
*  I wanted to push back on that a little and suggest that in fact, many of the organizations we see in
*  living organisms and design systems are there because of some functionality. They serve a useful
*  purpose and that many such functional motifs or architectures are in fact waiting to be revealed.
*  Under this view, a lot of the design work done by evolution is actually an exploration of a kind of
*  platonic design space, followed by retention of useful motifs rather than a real creation de novo.
*  I wonder what you make of that notion. Thanks.
*  All right. That was a long one, but did you get it all?
*  Yes, I think I got it all. That's a heck of a question because I think logically, of course,
*  there is a platonic maybe undercurrent. But in fact, I think I'm more like Aristotle did not
*  believe that Plato's forms existed in a transcendental realm. I want to stay agnostic
*  about that, but I certainly want to say that they are embodied and revealed and acted upon
*  in virtue of the confluence of these constraints occurring at a particular moment, at a particular
*  time. Locally.
*  Locally.
*  I think I used to think of myself more as a Platonist when I remember getting into philosophy
*  and I got into philosophy because back in the day, a lot of schools allowed you to,
*  if you were not a science or engineering major, you could substitute a symbolic logic course
*  for a math requirement as one of your requirements. I thought anything to get rid of not to do math,
*  which I am sorry I did. But when I took the first philosophy course, it was like discovering a
*  whole new platonic world. It was like, you know, if I'd taken another history course, yeah, you know,
*  it's another king, another queen, another war, another this, but this was like a whole new floor
*  in a building that I'd never seen before. That kind of transformation.
*  Um, but more and more, I want to kind of remain grounded and rooted to
*  natural phenomena. So I really want to naturalize my arguments and
*  speculating about a platonic transcendental realm.
*  Well, he said a kind of platonic. He hedged a little bit.
*  Well, if that's the case, then I'm perfectly happy with his book that way.
*  So that what is the kind? Well, in Aristotle's case, it's the, it's the,
*  Aristotle believed in forms. It's just that he believed in embodied forms and forms as they were.
*  And so what I want to say is that they are created by this confluence of constraints.
*  Um, my main concern is to make sure that they are taken seriously such that
*  meaning is taken seriously. In other words, um, the, an embedding organizational level gives meaning
*  to the components. Um, the amount of glucose in a fudge brownie that I can eat and not get sick
*  is given meaning by what my homeostasis metabolism is operating as well. Yeah, you're okay
*  now, but don't do it very often kind of thing. So that meaning is the multiple
*  realize ability of the ambiguous aspect being disambiguated by context, but, but not, not,
*  and I use the word context very deliberately. I don't want to use context to mean any old
*  environment. I want to mean the environment in which a system is embedded and from which it has
*  drawn some of its context is enabling constraints and in terms of which it implements its, um,
*  um, stabilizing or top down, uh, constraints. So, so I, I want to say these are, these are
*  new and the properties are real so that, um, yes, superconductivity and a laser has brand new
*  properties that are real. Did they exist in a preexisting platonic realm? I don't think I want
*  to speculate on that. I'm perfectly happy. So, and to me, real means it has causal power.
*  It has some kind of, it makes, it makes a difference. If it's every phenomenon, you know,
*  then I don't, that kind of emergence, weak emergence, that kind of emergence doesn't
*  interest me that much. Okay. I don't want to speak for Kevin, but, um, kind of reformulating his
*  question, you know, a lot of what you and the field and dynamical systems theories talks about is
*  these state spaces and when you're on a dynamical, like when you're on your trajectory within the
*  state space, you, yeah, you can visit different areas within the state space, not all of them,
*  and the constraints, constrained where you can visit in the state space. Right. But if you,
*  I wonder if that, that kind of platonic realm that Kevin is alluding to is you can think of it as
*  the state space that, um, whether a state space is a real thing, right? On a trajectory later,
*  we can say that we can define the state space by the trajectory and the boundary conditions of the
*  possible values that it could have taken. But if it's not visiting, uh, a particular area of the
*  state space, would that, and it did, would that then be a new thing or would it be visiting a
*  thing for which it already had a capacity for and thinking in terms of like the functions that
*  Kevin was talking about? I think that's what normal science is. Normal science is the visiting of
*  areas in possibility space. It hadn't visited before, but it's pretty much the same possibility
*  space. I think that's development. Oh, biology. I think evolution. I think there are times when
*  it's the entire possibility space that is new. That's what I want to call a creative
*  emergent character. Is this related to Stuart Kaufman's adjacent possible idea?
*  Maybe. Whether we go step by step, you know, going through each adjacent possible,
*  or in the case of a Bernard cell, it doesn't seem that it's adjacent possible. It seems as though
*  there's a threshold of instability beyond which you need to reorganize all the parameters,
*  all the variables. Everything acquires a different meaning because it's in a,
*  and it's in a qualitatively different space. And it seems to me that that's what happens,
*  for example, a cell in a Petri dish as opposed to a cell within a tissue. Okay. It's a whole,
*  different qualitative phenomenon. And so it's, and it's the new possibility space that I want
*  to say is being created. It's an emergent quality. It's not just a new corner in the existing
*  possibility space. I'm perfectly happy going adjacent possibles, alas to Kaufman. Yeah.
*  This is from Mack Shine who's been on the podcast. He thinks, he calls himself a systems
*  neurobiologist, and he really tries to think across scales and a lot of his research is
*  dealing with things like how neuromodulation interacts with network level things. So these
*  things are hard to think about and to research, obviously. So let me pull up this question.
*  Hi, Alicia. This is Mack Shine from the University of Sydney. When we think about top-down
*  constraints over bottom-up activity, we often invoke concepts like the self. So I can imagine
*  myself being hungry and that will help constrain the types of actions that I might take in order
*  to find food and satiate my hunger. But there are a number of really fascinating situations like the
*  so-called flow state and also states with pharmacological manipulation when the sense of
*  self can dissolve. Yeah. Yet you still see quite coherent cross-scale behaviour. People don't just
*  crumble into a heap. They can still perform music and sports at a high level or have a nice walk
*  through the forest. So my question is, do you view the sense of self as an illusion or do you think
*  of it just as one of many ways in which a system that's organised across scales can be organised?
*  Thanks. And Mack wants to know whether his question was better than Kevin's. No, I'm just kidding.
*  No, they're very good, both of them. You know, I keep thinking how with
*  Gazaniga's experiments with the cut corpus callosum that there were a whole bunch of weird things like
*  we discovered about somebody was shown an image to the right eye and another image to the left eye
*  and people confabulated. And so you wonder if in these cases where the self seems to dissolve,
*  there's nevertheless enough connectivity to maintain a coherent structure.
*  Structure being the self? What's the structure?
*  I would say a dynamic constraint that keeps being you. To a lesser example, I think people who sleep
*  walk or who are hypnotised will nevertheless not bump into the coffee table. They go around the
*  coffee table. But these could be sort of on the automatic side of behaviour, right? So there's
*  automatic and controlled processes. Right. Well, but there is control enough that you walk and you
*  don't maintain that awareness. But maybe the flow state would be because Mack mentioned the flow
*  state. That is like when your automatic processes take over but you still barely have some sort of
*  control and you're in a heightened, you're trying really hard and it kind of switches and then you're
*  watching yourself do it kind of. Yeah. And you wonder whether we can, could that be a bit like
*  these optical illusions where you can see one side and not the other? And so to what extent do those
*  constraints, to what extent do those levels of awareness conflict with each other, can mutually
*  support each other and reinforce each other or not? Again, I think that the next stage of this is
*  going to be a study of all the different modes of constraint that are all operating simultaneously.
*  As I started writing this, all of a sudden things like entrenchment, like buffering, I have a whole
*  chapter where I catalog some of these buffering and entrenchment and delay,
*  scaffolds and all of these that seem to all be operating simultaneously and that certainly
*  a lot of the social scientists have understood very, very well. In public policy, oh look,
*  if we can entrench this rule and regulation, it will hang on for way longer and avoid any kind of
*  attempts to remove it as a regulation that I live in DC. That's why I think about it.
*  And so you wonder, starting to map things in terms of constraints, in terms of possibility spaces,
*  might start to illustrate how all of these work and the possibility of therapeutic intervention
*  as a result because that's what all this recent talk about psychedelics. You wonder to what extent
*  a psychedelic literally disintegrates the constraint regime of the self, of the pre-established
*  coordinates and parameters and so on. The ego. Exactly, the ego. You wonder to what extent that
*  is a disruption of the constraint regime more than the disruption of vision or, yeah, vision too. You
*  get maybe hallucinations, but that's not as interesting as, I go like that and I push my
*  eyeball, I can hallucinate all these standard optical illusions. We don't call them hallucinations,
*  call them optical illusions. So at what point do we start looking at this? And the answer is,
*  that's going to take a lot of very interesting research. Kind of like Ramachandran's famous
*  example with the phantom limb and the mirror and so on. How is that possible unless there is some
*  control regime that is modulating the sense of pain that incorporates,
*  you know, I can imagine being in an automobile accident and having my arm mangled or my ear,
*  these descriptions of these IEDs and you know. Yeah, thinking of chalkboard scraping and things
*  like that. Correct, correct. And so you go, well, here's everything together because if you didn't
*  have the visual input, if you didn't have the conceptual understanding of what this means,
*  on and on and on, you wonder if the pain would be different. And so how all of these constraint
*  regimes interact and what are the necessary inputs at each point to maintain that particular
*  constraint regime so that then you have a global sense of self that I'm not sure we're all that
*  coherent in everyday. I don't feel coherent, but my wife went back to Deferrington.
*  To be operating, but it's not like, you know, I heard something horrible happening outside,
*  I wouldn't react. And even in a sense of flow, I think
*  there's enough cognitive control that if some horrendous perturbation, the standard answer is,
*  you drive home and you don't even know if you went through that red light or you don't because you
*  drive home in that path every day and you don't even think about it. But certainly if a child
*  ran across, then you'd immediately get out of that flow and react. So there's how much control,
*  in which case, how can we use it therapeutically for obsessive compulsive disorders, for PTSD,
*  for all of these, I think those are all disorders of constraint regimes.
*  It's the regulatory system that's shot. It's like the on switch is on all the time,
*  or it isn't modulating it the way it's supposed to modulate it. So these are regulatory, meaning
*  constraint regime issues, not structure, not function. It's the regulatory constraint regime
*  that modulates these other two that we don't understand that much about, I think, OCD, PTSD,
*  chronic anxiety or depression, all of these that are sort of, I think we've pretty much taken care
*  of. No, we haven't taken care of it, but we understand how it works, the low hanging fruit
*  of the, you know, yeah, well, you know, the glucose is out of whack that causes it. But where
*  stress or epigenetic stress can be inherited several generations down, that's a regulatory
*  issue. And that's what methylation does. And that's what I think a lot of these constraint regimes do.
*  So there's this phenomenon, sort of piggybacking on what Mack was asking about. There's this
*  phenomena in psychedelics, right, you can use them therapeutically. And in some cases,
*  like near death experiences serve as therapeutic events, and people come back kind of different,
*  right? And is this a way to is one way to imagine that? And maybe even electroshock therapy is
*  another example. I'm not sure if that's a good example. But I think, yeah, yeah, you have all
*  these kind of entrenched constraints locally in your brain and your mind and operating things.
*  And then when you so I'm sure you're aware of the psychedelic study that when you administer
*  psychedelics, often what happens is there's higher connectivity in your brain, less modularity,
*  right? And could could you maybe this is speculation, but would you think of that as just
*  resetting all of the attractor states, and then when they come back up, they can come back in
*  slightly different ways, they might not probably and it might open up, it might make the interfaces
*  more porous to contemporary experience. So you don't have to be worried that the explosion is the
*  IED, or that that that you don't have to wash your hands a million times in order to because you
*  Yes, I, I think that the that more and more as we read these kinds of novel
*  forms of therapy that they are, they usually are targeting issues of regulation.
*  Hmm.
*  Really fact to me fascinating. Yeah,
*  this is then starting to study how exactly that connect the home stays, stays whole,
*  stays straight down. I mean, it's kind of a dome. They all because all the connect on the proteomics
*  and all the rest of them all the homes, all the homes then are modulated by the whole constraint
*  dome of the entire but that also includes the constraints of your society. You know,
*  I love traveling to Europe. When I travel to Europe, the weight of history is very obvious
*  compared to the United States, you ask somebody at a restaurant in anywhere in Europe, and how
*  do you prepare this dish? Half of the time, it's the way it's always been prepared.
*  Yeah.
*  Whereas in America, if you do it the same way as you did it six months ago, oh, you're stale,
*  you're boring, you're old, it's encouraged the constraint regime. Now, that's not to say that
*  they're not all such problems for marginalized societies where the constraint regimes are very
*  clearly kept entrenched very deliberately. Yes, I understand that. But it's all a question of
*  the constraint coming from the culture as well. That's why in the four E's, the whole
*  for example, their emphasis on affordances.
*  This is the so I don't know if we said earlier, this is like the inactive embodied.
*  What are the other two? The four E's anyways, the embodied cognition.
*  Embodied cognition, which Andy Clark and Paolo and even Merlin Dullin, what about when?
*  Extended.
*  Extended, embodied, enacted.
*  There we go. We got three out of four.
*  Yeah. I always say, I frankly do not think that a chair affords opportunities for seating for a lot
*  of people. You hear stories of folks from I don't know which culture who were brought to the United
*  States and they will stand on the toilet because it didn't occur. And I don't think a tatami mat
*  affords opportunities for sleeping for those of us who were not raised in a Japanese. I mean,
*  affordances are clearly embodied, embedded in the constraint of the society in which you grew up
*  or you know about.
*  Embedded, you just said the fourth E, it's embedded.
*  It is, okay. And I think how things get, see, I don't think you have embeddedness in
*  Newtonian science. Things are just plunked into a featureless space and time in Newtonian science.
*  Yeah. That's the beauty of it too, because it's simplicity, right? It's spherical cows.
*  It's in a vacuum.
*  It's correct. But it's featureless. Whereas embeddedness is you're really embedded,
*  meaning that embedding layer affects you and you are a part of that embedding dynamic as well.
*  It goes both ways.
*  All right. I want to ask you, because we're coming up on time and I have a thousand other things to
*  ask you, but let's stay on brain and mind for just one more question here. And then I have some,
*  I want to ask you about artificial intelligence and your thoughts on that. So thinking about
*  dimensionality and going up in these, a myriological level, right? So a lot of this
*  modern neuroscience is reducing the dimensionality of your brain activity into these low dimensional
*  manifold structures. And then the dynamics come in when you have a trajectory along that manifold.
*  And a lot of some people think that that's, well, maybe that's the closest thing that we can get to
*  right now in describing, in relating brains to minds. And then, but marrying that idea with the
*  idea of capacity. And this goes back to Kevin Mitchell's question. What I want to think is
*  that I'm not a low dimensional mind. I have a high capacity, right? Is there a way, like,
*  is there a story I can tell myself that I'm going from the high dimensionality brain activity that
*  I have moving quote unquote up a level to mind? And that can, that's a messy statement. I know.
*  Can I increase my dimensionality? Do I have to reduce it? No, I think, for example,
*  letters form words. I think of a word as
*  a higher dimension, you can do more with those words, you have options available in words,
*  and keep going sentences. But that's certainly true for atoms, molecules.
*  Is the higher dimension, does that do you mean, is it a higher
*  possibility space? Or is it? I guess that's kind of equated to higher dimension.
*  Yeah, that's what I think of. It's a higher, it's a possibility space, whose coordinates
*  are relational. Okay. And if that's the case, then you have a way higher possibility space.
*  So that's why, for example, the example I used in the book, which is Monta's understanding of
*  how these chimps are able to understand, reach, because the possibility space they have
*  forged is a task-defined possibility space. But it's a different type.
*  Exactly. The type is simpler in that you have one concept of a type that captures all the way. You
*  have to look at the colored dots, you have to look at the movement of the dots and so on.
*  But it's the task that is defined. And the behavior is executed in terms of that task.
*  Is that lower dimensional? I think it's way more sophisticated than it would just
*  in terms of the intensity of the flash of light.
*  But here the task is a huge constraint as well.
*  Yes, but it's a much more complex dynamic than would be the physical features alone, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes people say that complex systems are a simplified description of what's going on.
*  Sometimes I think of it more like streamlined. The streamlining gives you characteristics that
*  you wouldn't have otherwise. And so the organization of that monkey's brain in response to training,
*  which would be the neighboring constraints, it seems to me opens up a world for the monkey
*  that may be captured by the essential characters of the task, but not of the
*  pure physical component alone. So in that sense, I think of it as an expansion. Chemistry can do more
*  than physics. Biology can do more than chemistry, even though they are nonetheless not violating any
*  of the underlying laws. It's the organization and the complexity of that organization that
*  opens up possibilities, I think. All right. So my mind could be more cool than my brain activity.
*  I could feel better about my mind than my brain. Probably. Yeah. Brain gets really
*  you know, and I think that's true. I think as people age, they get worse at
*  tasks that are just repetitive or... Oh, I thought that's all they could do are tasks that are
*  repetitive. But I think understanding connections and understanding nuances and things like that.
*  Oh, I'm thinking way aged. You're thinking like our age, maybe. Well, I'm thinking of the difference
*  between... I don't know. It's more like difference between understanding and just pure
*  speed of activity. My grandmother who's 99, she cannot learn a new card game, right? She can play
*  bridge, but she can't learn a new card game. But that's 99. Yeah. So maybe that's even a different
*  type. Any wonder. Maybe she's not interested in it. Maybe. Come on, grandma.
*  Yeah. But I see it's a different kind of understanding. I don't know. Would you call
*  that wisdom? Well, hopefully. I think that's what philosophers were looking for. And the question is,
*  but I don't think it automatically happens as you get older. There's an awful lot of old fools around
*  there. There sure are a lot of old fools out there. Yeah. Okay, Alicia, I don't want to take all day
*  for you. So I want to switch to artificial intelligence here for a few moments. Are you
*  good on time for a few more minutes? Yes, I am. Great. All right. This is a lot of fun for me.
*  No, me too. So I was actually kind of surprised in revisiting dynamics in action and you go into it
*  in a little more detail, I think, and context changes everything, that you refer to like neural
*  network examples. And in both books, you talk about the semantics that come along with syntax
*  when you put recurrence in these neural networks and you cite Jeffrey Hinton and actually Michael
*  Plout, who are David Plout, who was one of the authors on that paper. I did a course with him.
*  Anyway, that's neither here nor there. But I always call him hidden blood and shallows because
*  hidden and shallows are hidden. But that, that I will go ahead and finish up.
*  Well, anyway. Yeah. Well, so given what we've been talking about and, you know,
*  these interlocking systems and how important that is for complexity and the constraints,
*  given all that, I'm slightly surprised. And you talked about constraint of closure from Massimo
*  and me. Moreno and Massimo, which I love that book also. But that is very specific to like biological
*  systems and not just biological systems, but complex systems in the natural world. And it's not
*  those types of things that we've been talking about are not built into neural networks, or only
*  some of them are because maybe you talk about the recurrence and how that can lead to semantics.
*  So anyway, I was slightly surprised that I started reading about like the neural networks because I
*  thought, oh, well, a lot of the things that seem to be important in these complex dynamics that
*  give rise to our rich mental worlds and rich ecologies and stuff are missing in the artificial
*  intelligence systems, or maybe they're not. And I wonder what you think is missing in current AI.
*  I think what's missing in current AI is context. In other words, somatic.
*  Somatic. Oh, okay. Because context, I think, is it context changes? No, no, that's the title of your
*  book. All you need is attention, which is a different form of context. And like the modern
*  transformer, which underlies all these large language models, is all about context in terms
*  of word embeddings. But it does not have somatic information. It does not include historical
*  context. Well, this is how it's changed over time. So I think you need, it does not include social,
*  except indirectly as the social aspects get revealed in languages. Otherwise, you don't have
*  direct somatic interaction. Now, once you have these things, once you have the chip,
*  you have the Nvidia chip in a machine that you kind of raise as a child with all the video,
*  with all the video, with all the auditory. You're actually, you're speaking exactly to
*  my previous guest. I haven't released this yet, but he raises artificial agent chicks
*  exactly like newborn chicks to look at this developmental trajectory over time.
*  Which people did with chimps, remember? They tried to do that, but that did not turn out very well.
*  Because at some point it didn't scale up. Now, the question is whether the, but I think that if in fact
*  we have, we have eons of evolution behind us, of the planet, of the, or of life and so on,
*  you wonder if you can short circuit any of that and get-
*  Right. Well, we seem to be, partially.
*  Well, I mean, I certainly want to say a sunflower is aware of the sun.
*  Okay.
*  Tropism is a form of awareness. I don't care what you call it. Is it self-awareness? No,
*  I don't think so. I wouldn't want to say that. So it's the thought example of the, you know,
*  which the elephants and so on, now they're saying crows can do it and so on. So is that,
*  what is it like to be a crow as well as a bat? So at what point do you start saying, well,
*  this is not just, it recognizes its body with something and it really recognizes itself,
*  as a self or is there a self in the chimp that can point to the screen when it sees its image with
*  a dot on its forehead. At each point, I would say it's an emergent property, but certainly
*  I've got to tell you those hidden plump chalices. I had been playing around with these problems for
*  ages and I had not sat down to write dynamics in action until I read Hinton Plump and Chalice,
*  which at the time was, I went, the fact that that's really simple. I mean, we're talking
*  how many decades ago? Neural network was able to, according to Chalice, I think it was, when
*  somebody asked him, how do you explain that it produces the errors of deep dyslexia, not surface
*  dyslexia? And his answer was, I can only explain it by saying it self-organized a semantic
*  attractor. So semantics would be an emergent property that changes the output. That's what
*  I, why I would call it strong emergence. That's what I, why I would call it top down. It changes
*  the probability distribution of what its behavior is such that it produces an output that reflects
*  the semantics of the attractor. But so AI does not have closure of constraints. So this is another
*  idea that, you know, it's not self-generating. Its byproducts don't feed back in that sense,
*  or maybe you have a different outcome. Now, now, now, now it doesn't. Exactly. Okay. That's the
*  question. The question always is not what's practically doable today, but in principle. Sure,
*  but I mean, are we going to have to emulate life then? Are we going to have to have artificial life
*  to have what, whatever the hell real artificial intelligence is, right? And that's again,
*  an answer for the constraint. How many of these constraints are really not necessary
*  for intelligence systems that would assist a neurologist or a, you know, maybe you don't need
*  experience, you know, emotion or, you know, I mean, I don't know. So, but my, but what I find
*  fascinating is that even without somatic input, without any of this other stuff, the kinds of
*  errors that people talk, oh, they hallucinate that it's so similar to the kinds of errors that you
*  got with the split brain Gazaniga issues. The thing is making up some kind of story that would
*  make all the inputs it has so far coherent. Correct? Even if it is, well, that's a typo.
*  Seen one where the output, well, the people were, the trainer was saying, no, that's not right.
*  That's not right. That's not right. At one point it said, well, you know, that was just a typo.
*  Excuse me. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. What ideas or concepts do you find yourself like
*  revisiting the most when you're working? What ideas do you have? Do you revisit and are unsure
*  about or think you need to grapple with more? I think the notion of how do you account for
*  the emergent properties characteristics in each particular case, in each particular individual.
*  How do we, how, is there any hope to be able to map this other than say, well, if each one is unique,
*  then well, then that's the end of science. I mean, we need some kind of general.
*  Formal.
*  Formal. We both winced there. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know how to phrase it. Is it a
*  back forth hermeneutic kind of multiple constraint satisfaction? How does that work?
*  And I love that example that I got from Kussler and Koenig, I think their book way back went on
*  psychology. Oh. You know, imagine you're renting out an apartment and the apartment has one
*  large wall and it's got a window here and so on. And this is going to be your bedroom. And so
*  you're constrained because the bed has to fit against maybe a wall, but then the chest doesn't
*  fit because the other wall. So it's a question of multiple constraint satisfaction. So do you turn
*  the chest of drawers into a night table because that's the only place it fits. And so you're
*  adjusting it and it's constant adjustment, but that's what you see in dynamical systems.
*  That's the kind of meta stability that a someone riding a bike or someone on a tight rope, you know,
*  all these people going on a highway or a tight rope. It's not the kind of equilibrium of your
*  old time near equilibrium thermodynamics. It's a meta stability where it's a constant adjustment
*  of constraints. Correct? And so how do we, is there any hope to be able to map this in a way
*  that provides some kind of general guidance as to how this is going to play out in a particular
*  situation? How much do you have to know of the background? How much do you know, do you have to
*  know the context to be, you know, and I think, I think that's one good thing about it that
*  Aristotle had said was you don't, you can't teach law, medicine and ethics because those are
*  eminently context dependent compared to science. So, so how do you do it? You can only do it through
*  apprenticeships because the apprentice gives you this. And when I taught class, this is what I do.
*  You know, you get a feel for it. So, so is that what a good coach in a business does? Because
*  they've got enough of a feel for it. They might not be able to formalize it into a standard algorithm,
*  but they've got a feel for the situation that therefore can provide guidance. This is why a
*  coach doesn't need to be more of an expert than the expert as well, I imagine. You know, you have
*  to have a feel for it. And how do you, how do you formalize the feel of something? And that's what
*  a master musician does. I just finished reading a book by Adam Gopnik called The Real Work,
*  and it's about the mystery of mastery. Oh, it's fun to read. And so he talks about, you know, how
*  do you, is the master seeing something that's at a different level? And Hofstadter used to talk
*  about that when he talked about the chess master who's shown a chess game in progress for a few
*  seconds, and then they're asked to reproduce. They have the feel for the board. They would always put
*  the pieces in different locations than what was actually presented to them. But the strategy,
*  the strategic position, white and black were in remained the same. So what are they seeing
*  that the newbie doesn't see? The newbie is worried about playing the piano, one finger here,
*  one finger there. Simulating each move. That's like the physical signal that's coming in.
*  Obviously, mastery means that you see a level of organization that in the case of chess is strategy,
*  in the case of magician is the prestidigitation. It's the magic. And what is it that you're seeing
*  that then matters? And I think that's the constraint regime that we're all trying to figure out.
*  Why is it that the same person that the soldier next to that one didn't get PTSD?
*  They were in the same explosion. Because they were more of a man.
*  See, that was the old tradition. It had to be an internal characteristic. Whereas what I'm saying
*  is what are the interdependent constraints that make a difference? You began that with wondering
*  if there is no hope or if there is hope. Is there hope? Do you feel optimistic?
*  Look, you've got to assume that we're all humans. So there's got to be some commonalities somewhere.
*  At what scale? At what granularity? It's hard to say because you look at families and you see
*  kids from the same family raised by the same parents going to the same school. And they're
*  so different. So you wonder how does that happen? Is that all birth order? I mean,
*  there was a time where people talked a lot about that. Temporal constraints matter. Temporal order
*  has to matter at some point. But to what extent? To what degree? I think that's what's fun about
*  this is that there's a whole new possibility space of research that opens up when you look in terms
*  of constraints rather than looking in terms of... When the people were into the genome,
*  I thought people are assuming again, one disease per genome. That is never going to happen. I knew
*  that that was the case now. You knew that. I didn't know that. I mean, yeah, because I have
*  this linear thought. That's the way I was raised. We all were raised that way. That's what we all
*  assume. But now the question is, well, is it going to be one protein fold per disease? So
*  at what point is it... No, it's the context that makes it fold this way rather than that. And
*  therefore gets this functionality rather than that, even though it's the same string of amino
*  acids. So, all right, so it's the confirmation. So what is it in the context that makes it
*  conform a certain way? Well, in the case of development, we know that one cell in one part
*  of the fertilized egg is the one that... Because if it's in that location, that's what's going to
*  turn into the first neuro crest. Is that pure random? Then that raises that brings randomness
*  there rather than at the quantum level. So how does that work? Who knows? But it's fun to think
*  about. It opens up a whole new way of looking at a whole level of organization that we thought was
*  just illusory or just epistemically convenient. But if we really say, all right, now let's pretend
*  just for the sake of argument, it's real. How does this play out? What does this mean? What are the
*  implications? I mean, it's not just one level though. God, I now want to ask you, what's beyond
*  consciousness? It's turtles all the way up. Down, sideways. I just use that metaphor.
*  Every... It's everywhere. It's the whole tangled... It's an entangled bank. But it's not random.
*  People still use the word chaos when they refer to things like the Lorenz attractor to mean it's
*  this sort... No, it's just a high level of organization that we didn't appreciate before.
*  That Lorenz butterfly is very organized. Are you kidding? But it never repeats the same trajectory
*  twice because of its path dependence and so on. So we have to understand what are the constraints
*  that lead to that higher level of organization and how does that work? Well, Alicia, in terms
*  of possibility spaces, it just occurred to me that if the science, the philosophy of constraints is a
*  possibility space, your book, Context Changes Everything, filled the hell out of that space.
*  I'm glad that we got to visit some of those places today. I really appreciate it. Thank you.
