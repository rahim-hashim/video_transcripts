# BI 114 Mark Sprevak and Mazviita Chirimuuta: Computation and the Mind
**Brain Inspired:** [September 22, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQzUKzpV5PU)
*  Computation is a model but you know science being an assembly of different ways of thinking
*  about some very complicated things in nature it's always handy to have some you know overarching
*  analogy or better understood system and so it's a very seductive model because if mind
*  isn't computation what on earth could it be? But there's an entirely different way to think
*  about the role of computation in mental life and cognition. Computations are ways of describing
*  complex things in the world in simple idealized terms. If you're a serious perspectivist you
*  give up on the question of like asking well what is really truthfully literally going on in the
*  brain and you admit that you're only going to be able to see things by way of a perspective so that
*  question you know how much is it really computation and how much is something else you realize that
*  you're not going to be able to answer that. Whenever I worry about it I think that you know
*  I focus on the stuff that the journey really and it's enjoyable like the the process of
*  intellectual inquiry that is the thing which is really really rewarding and why I got into
*  this in the first place. This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hey everyone this is Paul. On today's episode I have two philosophers who have a background also
*  in neuroscience Mark Sprevec and Masrita Chirumutta. Masrita has been on the show before. They're both
*  doing philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. Feel free to judge my pronunciation but I think
*  that they're both acceptable and our conversation today largely focuses around the topic of the
*  computational approach to the mind. So in some ways it's a continuation of last week's episode
*  with David Barack and John Krakauer but today we're talking more about the question of alternative
*  perspectives on approaching the mind. Are there useful alternative perspectives outside of the
*  computational approach? We also discussed some of the history of philosophy of mind some of those
*  ideas and how they relate to where we are now and our current approach to the study of the mind. We
*  talk about representations the possibility of naturalizing representations and whether that's
*  even a desirable pursuit and we start off talking about the relationship between philosophy and
*  science and whether philosophy and science of the mind are separate things or should be separate or
*  whether they would be better served more integrated. So if these kinds of topics and this episode is
*  interesting to you I would highly recommend checking out the book that Mark Sprevec edited
*  with Matteo Colombo and Mark contributed to the book as well as did Masrita. The book is the
*  Routledge Handbook of the Computational Mind from just a couple years ago. Of course I link to it
*  in the show notes at braininspired.co.uk slash podcast slash 114 114 where you can also learn
*  more about Mark and Masrita. Thank you Patreon supporters. Thank you. You make my world go
*  round as did Mark and Masrita during this conversation. Enjoy. Masrita you've been here
*  before. Mark has not been here before so here's the real pressing question and maybe I don't I
*  can't really mute Mark's headphones but who's the better philosopher? Mark or his wife Michaela?
*  Masrita. Yeah I don't think that philosophers can be put on a scale of quantitative goodness.
*  Each is qualitatively good in their own way. Mark whose fault was that that you married a philosopher?
*  I've been yeah I've been I've been very lucky there are not many philosophers on
*  the part of you. I got a good one. Yeah. Sorry you've embarrassed me. No that's okay. I've enjoyed
*  reading some of Michaela's work as well so it'd be it'd be fun to have her on at some point too
*  although she focuses more on sort of the physics side but she's also does a lot with prospectivalism
*  and cognitive sciences as well so really interesting stuff. So talking to Michaela has influenced my
*  thinking a lot so my trajectory has been to start off as kind of a hard-bitten what they call
*  realist about computation. I think you know it's all just objectively out there and you know and
*  there are real facts about what computations the brain performs and so forth and talking to Michaela
*  and to see the virtues of a perspective approach and the ways in which you might want to think
*  about different models how different models are used in different circumstances has kind of moved
*  me more towards a prospectivalism about this domain. Oh that's interesting well hopefully
*  we'll come back to pluralism and prospectivalism toward the end but I want to start off with just
*  philosophy in general and history I guess because they're really intertwined and you both appeal to
*  history a lot in your philosophy but Mark a few years ago you wrote a piece talking about how
*  philosophy can contribute to the sciences of the mind and you actually spell out four ways and I
*  don't know if we need to step through all four of those ways but you know what I'm wondering is how
*  you think philosophy is contributing most right now to the sciences of the mind.
*  Yeah well I hope you don't mind but I'm tempted to question sort of a presupposition in that
*  question which is that there's this thing philosophy which is contributing to this other
*  thing which is the sciences of the mind and so there's a I don't really see that there's a
*  sharp line between and what's going on in philosophy and the mind sciences so kind of
*  a very commonly held picture of the relationship between philosophy and the sciences is that
*  there's this community of scientists who are working in labs and psychology departments,
*  neuroscience departments and then over at some other end of the university there's this kind
*  of strange group of philosophers who are kind of free-floating and they're looking at what the
*  scientists are doing and why do they have to be strange? Well they are and kind of building
*  theories about what scientists are doing and I think that that's kind of a common way in
*  which people conceive of the relationship between philosophy and the sciences and I think it's
*  actually a really unhelpful model of picturing that relationship so it's a model that naturally
*  prompts the thought that philosophy is kind of a fundamentally different activity from the sciences
*  and it also prompts the thought that philosophy is probably unnecessary to the sciences so this
*  worry was very beautifully expressed by Richard Feynman when he said in a really cutting remark
*  that philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds. So I just
*  wanted to put that out there as an example of a kind of an unhelpful or an incorrect model of
*  the relationship between philosophy and the sciences and if you start off from that model
*  then you're gonna struggle to say how philosophy can contribute to the sciences.
*  Masreeda let me just ask you right off the bat do you think that neuroscientists and I'm just
*  gonna put a I'm gonna keep the divide there between science and philosophy just for this
*  question do you think that a neuroscientist would agree with that perspective or would they see
*  them as more separate? So would they agree with the Feynman perspective? No sorry with Mark's
*  suggestion that they shouldn't really they're not separate because that's coming from a philosopher.
*  Well I mean I can't speak for all the neuroscientists out there but I think that there
*  is a big division which comes from people that are having a lab and doing that kind of collaborative
*  work which is you know reliant on data and modeling and is quite a different culture in
*  terms of conferences and networks from the philosophical ones so just you know in terms
*  of like material and social groupings there is a difference in kind which maybe gets in the way of
*  scientists neuroscientists perceiving what would be some overlap in the interest of inquiry but at
*  the same time I think there are also some more like fundamental more fundamental differences
*  between science and philosophy as it's done today in terms of I like to think of the aims
*  of scientific research as being like not only understanding nature but also instrumental ones
*  about you know prediction and control and getting translational results which are just not part of
*  philosophy. Yeah that makes sense. Mark sorry I cut you off when I asked Masrita that question
*  were you gonna continue? Yes I agree with what Masrita was saying and so yeah I was gonna I
*  was gonna sort of consider you know what would be a better model of the relationship between
*  philosophy and the sciences and so as a sociological fact as Masrita was saying it may well be that you
*  know the people are in are in different places engage in different activities but that doesn't
*  really speak to the question of what if they're you know quite apart from who's doing what and
*  is there actually any difference in the kinds of intellectual inquiries that philosophers engage in
*  versus the scientists and I think that like a better starting point for thinking about the
*  relationship between the two views is the thought that all of us to a greater or lesser extent are
*  philosophers and so I'm a big fan of the philosopher Wilfred Sellars and in a 1962 he wrote this very
*  famous statement that the aim of philosophy abstractly formulated is to understand how
*  things in the broadest sense of the term hang together in the broadest sense of the term and
*  in my view I think Sellars got it exactly right so philosophical issues aren't marked out by them
*  being for example being the study of science or of what scientists are doing it's rather marked out
*  in terms of the kind of the overall scope and the focus of the inquiry so when one's kind of doing
*  philosophy or doing philosophical inquiry or making a philosophical contribution what one's
*  doing is you're kind of taking a step back from some of the details of a particular case or a
*  particular experiment that you're doing a lab and considering kind of broadly how matters hang
*  together relative to the kind of ambitions and goals that might have motivated the scientific
*  inquiry in the first place so you know on this kind of view and this sort of thinking this kind
*  of big picture thinking or fundamental thinking is in no way an unusual activity in science so we do
*  it all the time and it's also something that matters a huge amount to the ultimate success
*  of the scientific enterprise so on this kind of view where philosophy is about kind of seeing how
*  everything hangs together and philosophical work is by no means something which is kind of optional
*  or unnecessary or foreign to science it's really a strain or sensibility within scientific thinking
*  but yeah if i could come in there i think that the seller's conception of what philosophy is doing
*  does show how it's important for philosophy not to be over specialized that we pay a premium
*  for over specializing that we miss the big picture in the way that scientists normally benefit from
*  being hyper focused on like one specific mechanism or target of discovery whereas
*  philosophers can afford to be a bit more blurred out having like a more high altitude perspective
*  in order to see how things hang together and sure scientists can step back and examine those things
*  but at the same time there's much more pressure and also rewards for them to be more specialized
*  yeah i mean i like that seller's quote as well and i mean i have to say you know thinking about that
*  in retrospect one of the reasons why i took the step to leave science one of the reasons there
*  are multiple reasons is that i was not finding i was not moving fast enough in my conceptual
*  in the universe of what i wanted to to gain in terms of knowledge and the bigger picture
*  and i did not see a way that i could continue along the lines as mas rita was saying of needing
*  to write a grant needing to publish a paper needing to analyze data in a very specialized
*  manner i just couldn't see getting out of off that hamster wheel enough to at least for my own
*  i mean we all have different levels of needs right and to feel self-satisfied with something
*  and for my own satisfaction i i could not see a way that i could continue along that line in an
*  experimental neuroscience lab and still feel like i'm even understand all the big picture aspects
*  which is a goal of mine personally so having said that you know mas rita as you so as i've been away
*  from practicing science i worry a little bit that i'm losing touch with those sorts of questions and
*  how to ask the scientific kinds of questions and i'm floating very much more toward philosophy which
*  has been extremely enjoyable and now i'm making that you know distinction again which
*  as mark rightly said is really shouldn't be as blurred or as as distinct as you know we
*  sometimes make it but but mas rita do you feel at all like you are um i don't want to say losing
*  touch but drifting away from the science the practice of science does that worry you at all
*  yeah i mean certainly it does i mean in terms of you know having the right kind of mindset to write
*  to answer the right ask the right kind of pointed questions about a particular technique and all of
*  those um focus details that scientists really are sharp on um like being not spending my time amongst
*  scientists and engaging with those communities as much as i used to it is you know a skill that gets
*  rusty um so i like to hope that i keep up with it enough to have enough of the details that are
*  relevant for the philosophical writing that i'm doing even if i couldn't go back to the lab and
*  do the like experimental work that i used to do yeah so i don't need to worry about it too much
*  it depends what your your tasks are okay yeah just making a podcast that's all so yeah
*  yeah can i ask about the the specialization and this yeah this trend towards kind of
*  hyper specialization so this is something which is a pattern all across the sciences that
*  individual researchers particularly young researchers are incentivized to
*  sort of specialize in smaller and smaller niches and focus on tighter and tighter research questions
*  and i'd be interested to know what you think if this if this trend has changed somewhat in
*  cognitive neuroscience over say the past 20 years or so so my impression has been um that
*  and there's actually a little bit more tolerance for um asking big questions and big picture
*  thinking so some some years ago you know and thinking back to like 20 first and undergraduate
*  in the 1990s you were studying incredibly narrowly specified cognitive capacity so really really
*  specialized stuff which would be exhibited under some very very limited range of conditions and
*  then you would build a model of that and but now it's more it's perhaps more acceptable to sort of
*  focus on some of the bigger questions that you might think that work was kind of losing track
*  off so questions like how do we think how do we learn how do our brains give rise to conscious
*  experience how do we make moral judgments so my perception has been that there has been a
*  little bit of a shift in the mind sciences towards toleration of of these kind of big
*  questions and thinking of them as a kind of legitimate and serious research questions
*  and like my impression has been that this has been a kind of an uptake of
*  sort of philosophical thinking within the within the scientific community
*  I'm assuming he's asking you Masreta I mean I could respond but
*  you go first oh well um well yeah I mean that's actually kind of what I was going to ask you
*  because as you were talking I was thinking about if that's true and I tend to think that it is
*  somewhat true I don't know I'm not sure how to articulate it if it is true I'm wondering if it's
*  because uh the those specializations have gotten to the point where they've reached almost a limit
*  and and then you you kind of look around and think oh well what else how how can I move forward or
*  now kind of you have to look around me and ask what am I actually doing here at you know in this
*  space and then recontextualize how it relates and then you kind of have to back up and broaden out
*  and I'm wondering if if the specialization naturally pulls philosophical considerations
*  in that respect and then and then gets filled up a little bit more with with philosophical
*  work I don't know does that if that makes sense Masreta yeah I mean I'd certainly say there's a
*  like tolerance for that bigger picture thinking and that's there in the popular science literature
*  and cognitive neuroscience where you know there's certainly scientists writing about these issues
*  more generally and then in terms of experimental research where I see that coming in recently is
*  this trend you know towards more ethological experiments within cognitive neuroscience so
*  instead of you know training a primate or a rodent to do like one super specialized task and get
*  loads and loads of data on that looking at more naturalistic movements and behaviors
*  which involve pulling in thinking about perception and motor control and memory and navigation all in
*  the one experiment yeah what about in the kind of the theory building or model building where
*  is it accurate to say that there's a a bit more of support for the idea of kind of that there are
*  big general models which are going to be helpful in all sorts of circumstances so
*  thinking you know of Bayesian models reinforcement learning models like incredibly
*  general ideas that are providing insight into kind of big questions that then you can apply to
*  specific specific scenarios rather than taking some hyper specialized case and then building
*  a bespoke model just of that case there's a lot of things to talk about here one is just our
*  computational power now that affords the ability to run bigger models that can handle more data
*  right another thing to maybe talk about and I don't want to dominate this conversation but
*  another thing to maybe talk about is the fact that when when a model a new model comes on the
*  scene and it is successful in one domain it then just gets plastered over all over all over all the
*  other domains to see you know what what other questions it can handle so there's a lot of that
*  probably going on especially with Bayesian models and deep learning models let's just
*  see what they can work on yeah I think it's always been every
*  modeler and theoretician's dream in neuroscience to have the one modeling framework that will just
*  work across the board because that's the ultimate dream it seems that it isn't just a one-way
*  travel towards greater and greater hyper specialization which is kind of encouraging
*  that there's some force pushing back against that and it may well be as Paul diagnosed it that
*  that you just kind of run into a bit of a dead end once you once you go too far with the hyper
*  specialization and you need to have a slightly more general model yeah well if that's the case
*  that should be something that philosophers should learn from because definitely within
*  philosophy there's been this trend towards hyper specialization which I am not a fan of myself
*  no me neither hasn't one of the fixes to that hyper specialization been to look to the practice
*  of science to see what science is actually doing and start to start to deal like bring those
*  practices into the philosophy and relate philosophical discussions to the scientific
*  practices is that one motivating factor for looking to science to to avoid the hyper
*  specialized specialization yeah actually I would think it's been the reverse I mean you know
*  philosophy of science as it was done a few decades ago had plenty of people that
*  called themselves general you know thought of themselves as general philosophers of science
*  you know they would look at issues you know across the board maybe physics had more of a
*  preeminent role there but they considered their philosophies to be you know applicable to the
*  sciences generally and now that's actually becoming quite rare for someone to think of
*  themselves as a generalist and philosophy of science as opposed to a philosopher of
*  biology and maybe philosopher of synthetic biology or philosopher of computational neuroscience so
*  yeah the so I think one of the reasons for this in philosophy of science is that there's been more
*  more of a requirement for people to know the technical details of the science that they're
*  talking about and so obviously to get that immersed knowledge you need to focus you can't do that for
*  many many branches of science at once. One of the ways in which this can go wrong is that you end
*  up just doing a study of a really really specialized area in science and then you're really
*  starting to fit the Richard Feynman type model where you know you're just describing what the
*  what the scientists are up to and it's unclear why that's contributing to the
*  to the project of seeing how things more generally hang together.
*  This is one of your four ways that that philosophy contributes is to is co-hearing theories right so
*  that's exactly what you were just speaking to. Yeah exactly being able to step back a little bit
*  and see how different models might fit together and how different methodologies might fit together
*  so I think that that's something that you know philosophers have the luxury of being able to do
*  and often scientists do that and often the the greatest scientists are you know able to do that
*  amazingly well but yeah I think that philosophers are kind of well placed to
*  hopefully contribute to that project of seeing how different models fit together.
*  Maybe this is the question you're just asking Mark but a few moments ago but what is your view
*  you know from the philosophical perspective is science doing its job of co-hearing?
*  Is it co-hearing more or co-hearing less as time moves on different theories? How do you
*  view this the specialization versus co-hearing trend? Well you know what as you were saying
*  yourself you know there are a lot there's lots of variation across the sciences like my impression
*  is is that there's a kind of an upsurge in in people willing to try to step back and look at
*  look at the big picture and trying to push for models which are general powerful unifying
*  and trying to probe a little bit the limits of those models so I think that you know if we
*  think about the when which sellers characterized or that slogan by which sellers characterized
*  the philosophical project I think that that kind of big picture thinking is something which is really
*  and occurring more in cognitive neuroscience. Do you think it's getting funded more because
*  it's really the funders who control that to some degree so I wonder if that
*  ambition is trickling up to the funding agencies and I don't want to go down that road but you know
*  I just realized that there's a limitation. Yeah like I fear that the situation might be that you
*  have to kind of cut your teeth and doing some sort of very specialized work make a name for
*  yourself and then whenever you have a lab and have your name then you can start looking at the
*  bigger bigger picture stuff and lots of yeah really excellent people in cognitive neuroscience
*  are kind of doing that but yeah but the very fact that there is toleration or the thought that some
*  of these bigger questions are legitimate research questions I think is I think that's actually
*  encouraging and healthy and it's good so I worked myself in a when I was an undergraduate in a
*  physiology lab and I was a little bit put off and the work for the same reasons that you suggest
*  Paul that I kind of went into thinking okay I'm going to learn how the mind works, how vision
*  works and then I ended up studying you know some incredibly specialized capacity and getting very
*  puzzled by it but not really getting any further on the question which I originally had. So are
*  you are you going to give the name of the very eminent neuroscientist whose lab it was?
*  So this is so I very much enjoyed I learned a lot from so I was lucky I was lucky to be in the lab
*  of Horace Barlow in Cambridge so and who was yeah it was quite. I bet he was a pretty interesting
*  person to be around yeah really really amazing character so and so yeah so I learned a lot from
*  that I didn't I don't feel I learned a huge amount from the from the study I did over the summer though
*  which but you know what's what's interesting is that is that Barlow was had that higher idea
*  mindset and approach and yet you were still slightly befuddled by the the the specialization.
*  Right yeah he was very much a like blue skies theorist.
*  That's right it was really inspiring to listen to him and he was incredibly kind and generous to me
*  as a lowly undergraduate student it was really a privilege to work in his lab but I guess the best
*  I could do at the time was just to focus on my one tiny little experiment. I thought he didn't
*  run a physiology lab I thought like he after a certain time he. Psychophysics. It's like
*  so it was in the physiology department. The lab was in the physiology department. I see I see yeah
*  yeah interesting yeah what do you think so when I was interviewing for a postdoc and I'm not going
*  to name names here but the the faculty member with whom I was interviewing came from a well-known lab
*  and we were talking about his experience in that well-known lab and he said that well-known person
*  his advice to him sorry it's convoluted was just say a bunch of crazy shit and eventually
*  something will be true. What what do you think about that approach because then something will
*  stick that's kind of orthogonal to the sophisticated uh re-appreciating what we don't think was
*  sophisticated as sophisticated well that's a different that's like a divergent thinking
*  way of progressing. Is that is you think that's a good method? Yeah was it was this a method for
*  career progress or making scientific breakthroughs? Oh you know what I think I think the former I
*  think career but uh probably the latter as well I don't really know I'll have to go back and ask.
*  A lot of philosophers do this actually so so the landscape of possible views that one might hold
*  is absolutely enormous and the thought is okay I'll just land on something which is totally mad
*  and defend that to the death and you can make a name for yourself doing that and it's fun entertaining
*  in certain ways but um I don't know I was um so whenever I was a PhD student I was very influenced
*  by a philosopher who died and recently Hugh Miller and he was also a philosopher of science
*  and he was a unbelievably sharp mind and able to defend you know have the skill to play that
*  game and defend any view or um that way but um but yeah he had this criterion that you know you
*  shouldn't defend things which are daft and um so he would say that you know why waste time doing
*  that so you should use your you know if you have the intellectual skills which uh right and if you
*  are lucky to have and you should you know use them use them wisely and don't use them in defending
*  daft stuff just to make a name for yourself but I seem as sweet as point as well that you know
*  it's valuable as a whole in science for people to explore some crazy stuff just in case it does stick.
*  Is a computational brain is that crazy? Let's talk about the computational mind it seems like
*  a fine segue so these days in neuroscience you would not no one would call you crazy if you
*  thought that what the mind is is computation everything in neuroscience is computation
*  everything I mean that's what a that's what artificial intelligence is based on is the
*  computational approach to solving problems and we're asking computational questions so we see
*  computational answers to those questions um and we abstract away the the stuff that doesn't address
*  the computations and you guys have both talked about this so what do you think is is I mean and
*  we can we can bring in you know sort of the fundamentals of of the computational theory
*  of mind but just to start off uh just a really broad question is cog is cognition just computation?
*  Okay well short answer is no.
*  No that's very short that's good with your brain computer analogy yeah.
*  Yeah I mean so the the point being that you know computation is a model um more and we're going
*  to talk about perspectivism later in the um in the podcast I expect but you know.
*  If we need to we can talk about it now just wherever it.
*  Yeah but you know science being an assembly of different ways of thinking about some very
*  complicated things in nature it's always handy to have some you know overarching analogy or
*  better understood system often a man-made system which is you know much more transparent than
*  something that's been just found in nature like our brains are um and so it it's a very seductive
*  model because you have this question well if it's not if mind isn't computation what on earth
*  could it be because the closest we seem to have of a you know intelligent like system which is
*  um also intelligible to us we can actually make sense of how it's doing this intelligent seeming
*  behavior as a computer so I think people have been very much keen to you know foreclose on the
*  possibility that there are other perspectives on what cognition could be that aren't computational
*  ones yeah so I think that um so I agree with what Matsvita is saying here and I think
*  her and I you know have very similar views here I think that this is actually something which is
*  kind of useful to look a little bit back in in history on um so I think that for a long time
*  philosophers have said things which are kind of unhelpful or potentially misleading about
*  computation and cognition and I think that this is only getting corrected now thanks to the work
*  of of Matsvita and and other folks who are and thinking about it in a different way so so if we
*  go back in time a little bit so going back to the 1950s say to up until say the 1980s or early
*  1990s so computation was thought of as something very attractive because it was a escape from a
*  kind of a potential bind so if you go back the early days the 1950s um a very popular view of
*  the mind was that mental processes were identical to brain processes so this was the old-fashioned
*  identity theory of the mind so mental processes equal and brain processes yeah and it was
*  reductionistic so it was sort of denying really a separate level or ontology for psychology but
*  saying that you know ultimately detailed neurophysiology would have all the answers to
*  what mental states are.
*  Yeah so this was kind of the orthodoxy but then a number of people including the philosopher
*  Hilary Putnam pointed out a you know a very serious problem with the identity theory
*  which is that it seems perfectly possible that there could be cognition which uses different
*  physical hardware from the neurons that we in fact use so it just seems really a contingent
*  fact about us that we happen to use neurons to do our thinking with and there's nothing
*  inherently special about them it's more something to do with their function or their organisation
*  which enables cognition so it can't be that cognitive processes are brain processes because
*  cognitive processes could also be other things that could be implemented on other hardware.
*  Yeah but could yeah could I just chime in there but I mean there are different
*  kinds of you know multiple realisation here and some are some to me seem much more problematic
*  for the identity theory so it would involve like denying that an octopus has pain because
*  that's a very different kind of neural system from you get in versperates but to say that you
*  know completely different hardware could have pain well since we don't have around us you know
*  other kinds of physical systems that have pain that aren't animals that seems less of a problem
*  if you're an identity theorist but Putnam you know took that argument both ways it wasn't just you
*  know different kinds of animal never neural realisers but also like completely different
*  physical systems. Yeah so he wanted to at least allow for the possibility that there could be
*  thought that takes place on silicon so we might not have it now we might never get it but it's
*  at least something which is a possibility you know it's in principle possible or it's in principle
*  possible that you could have thought with you know other kinds of physical hardware so there
*  could be other agents who are not carbon-based life forms but are still capable of cognition
*  you don't want to kind of rule out that a priori yeah exactly extraterrestrials yeah so it may be
*  that it may be that they don't exist but that should be an empirical question of whether they
*  exist they don't exist you don't rule it out in your theory of what cognition is but now you're
*  talking about thought was that was the idea that it was thought that could be realized by other
*  hardware or computations so the idea was the focus was on thought and all aspects of mental life
*  and the idea was that it can't be identical to certain physical goings on and so the solution
*  that platinum proposed and that became very popular was that mental processes were computational
*  processes and the advantage of saying that is that computations are multiply realisable so you can
*  run computations on neurons you can run them on silicon you can run them on all sorts of other
*  hardware in principle and so this kind of gets around this worry about being a chauvinist and
*  just saying well cognitive processes are can only be brain processes or equal to brain processes
*  and so that that solution was called computational functionalism and that was a really really
*  popular view and basically orthodoxy and you know pretty much until today and so the idea is that
*  for lots of aspects for our mental life there's question about consciousness and things like that
*  but for lots of aspects of our mental life cognitive information processing aspects those
*  things are just computations and those computations happen to be implemented in us in neural activity
*  you use the past tense but yeah it's still excuse me still the de facto
*  sort of accepted view these days i would say that's right so but there's an entirely different way
*  to think about the role of computation in mental life and cognition and on this view which is kind
*  of one i favor and i think that's feda favors as well computations are ways of describing complex
*  things in the world in simple idealized terms so computational models they abstract they simplify
*  and they idealize physical processes into forms that are mathematically tractable and that we can
*  understand and that we can reason about so computational models are ways of looking at
*  complicated mass of stuff going on in the physical world and identifying sort of robust
*  mathematically quantifiable patterns inside that mass so the point of this kind of second way of
*  thinking about it that's kind of important to note is that and the motivation for appealing
*  to computation and to explain cognition derives in this case from the fact that humans we as
*  human inquirers are fundamentally limited so if we had god-like intelligence and kind of unlimited
*  perceptual abilities we could just look at the mass of complicated physical stuff directly so
*  we could just look at the spaghetti wiring in the brain and say oh yeah i understand what's going on
*  here i can understand that this connects to that and why this behavior is produced under these
*  physical conditions and i can tell you what would happen under this other condition
*  but we're just not like that so the mass of physical activity in the brain is just baffling
*  to us and the kind of the more you look at it the more baffling it seems to get so we need some way
*  to sort of simplify and idealize and cut it down to size and so the point is really about our
*  epistemic limitations it's not a point about a metaphysical point about needing to appeal
*  the computation because of multiple realization in different hardware the primary motivation
*  for appealing to computation to explain cognition is to use it to simplify and idealize what's a
*  super complicated and otherwise confusing and baffling system but it but it's interesting that
*  you know the neuroscientists using computational models they'll be much more aware of the
*  you know the value of abstraction and idealization and to some extent aware of all the details that
*  are being purposely left out of those models and not hung up about the partner multiple realization
*  arguments but yet they still have that ontological commitment to cognition being computation so it
*  seems interesting to me that when you're a working scientist in the weeds and doing this kind of
*  modeling it's also quite hard to step back from like equating the ontology of your model with the
*  ontology of the target the system that you're ultimately trying to understand maybe this is a
*  good point to bring in the pluralism perspectivalism aspect never not a good point to bring this
*  in. So if you think that the point of or primary motivation for appealing to computation is this
*  goal of being able to simplify and idealize this complex system then a natural kind of next step to
*  accept is that there are going to be multiple ways of doing that so there's not going to be kind of
*  one good way to do that so it's going to serve all of your ends so in some cases you want to
*  simplify in a certain way to capture patterns at one spatial scale or one temporal scale or in a
*  certain context or relative to certain tasks there are lots and lots of different ways of
*  idealizing the system into a computational model or simplifying the system into a computational
*  model so that kind of really chips away at the idea that there's kind of one canonical computation
*  which runs on the brain rather you know there are multiple computational perspectives you might take
*  in order to explain various stuff so once you kind of give up on that and you move towards a
*  kind of pluralist perspectivalist view then it becomes it begins to look that old equation of
*  you know cognition equals the computation that runs on the brain begins to look a lot less
*  a lot less credible and because there is no the computation that runs on the brain they're just
*  kind of multiple computational perspectives that you might adopt for different to explain different
*  capacities to predict different things yeah so there's multiple perspectives within computationalism
*  and also beyond computationalism as well so one can think of the brain not as a information
*  processor which has really defined functions that it's performing but also as something whose
*  ontology is just like any other biological organ or you could think of it as dynamical systems and
*  that's another perspective that people are into yeah that's right so i think that you know putnam
*  and at the time people thought that you know there would be a canonical computation that the brain
*  is performing and still do some people so putnam putnam thought of it in terms of the Turing machine
*  model so he thought that that algorithm that runs on the brain would take a Turing machine
*  form like that's not particularly credible and that particular architecture would not be
*  particularly credible as architecture for human cognition any longer but the idea that there is
*  one canonical computation that the system performs i think that that is an important assumption in
*  order to have that computational functionalist view where you say that there's this one-to-one
*  mapping between computation running on the brain and your cognitive processes but once you start
*  saying well there's loads of computation this very complicated system and i can model it all
*  sorts of different ways with all sorts of different computational architectures depending on what
*  i need to explain or what's the particular context of the task then you've broken that
*  link between one computation one one cognitive process one mental process i don't want to derail
*  us too much down to talk about mar but i find i found myself wondering in the last five minutes
*  or so of this conversation how this relates to mars computational level of analysis mark you
*  started off talking about how we're epistemically limited and there's a lot more going on and we
*  have to idealize and abstract away in order to talk about some computation because we're well
*  so here's the question is mars computational level could could be reformulated on the one
*  hand people talk about it's an ontologically let's say oh vision because he was concerned with vision
*  right so vision there's the computation of vision and that computation is ontologically real and i
*  don't know if this will get us into talking about realism and anti-realism but but then what you're
*  saying made me think and a perspectival and pluralistic vantage point on that would would
*  suggest that we shouldn't have any confidence that there is any ontologically real status of
*  the quote-unquote computation even for something like vision and instead we have to talk about it
*  that way because we're too dumb to to to really articulate the full story of what's happening
*  cognitively beyond the computations so is that a different way to think about mars computational
*  level is just another simplification yeah so um so i think that yeah mar was actually pretty sensitive
*  to this stuff although it's not yeah it's not it's not it's not the stuff that people kind of pick
*  up most from his view no this is another thing where we're going we misunderstand mar we
*  mischaracterize mar and it hasn't even been that long you know i know but but yeah on the
*  i think that you know if we think about this two roles of computation there's a computationalist
*  functionalist one advertised by putnam and then there's the the kind of the new thing that
*  computations is simplifying idealizing things which are it's been pushed by mads vida and so on the
*  on the first view you like a natural way to think of computations is a stuff which is out there as
*  processes or as things and whenever you start saying okay well i'm going to identify computations
*  with mental processes then you know you've reduced and i did one property or one kind of process to
*  another on the second view you give up thinking about really computations as things which are
*  kind of out there and you start talking a lot more about computational models and the virtue of
*  computational models and computational descriptions where you might have a whole array of different
*  computational models which are applying to your physical system and helping you to kind of explain
*  and deal with certain capacities and certain circumstances so there's a shift between talking
*  about computation or thinking of computations as things which are out there to thinking about well
*  computational descriptions and descriptions what are those useful what role do they play in science
*  yeah i mean in mark the computation is a level of explanation so that suggests that it's you know
*  in some way related to the scientist's inquiry and what they are trying to explain but at the
*  same time he does write about it as you know you need to find out what vision is for so it's it's
*  functional there is a functional vision for the organism and there is a computation that the
*  visual system is doing or set of computations that the visual system is doing from one part
*  cascading to another part so he's not as much of a pluralist as you are mark yeah so so at the
*  computational like the way i understand the morris computational level it's a description
*  of the problem that the brain is facing in various circumstances so it's not it's not
*  necessarily telling you a great deal about the process or algorithm which is running
*  it's a description of the problem that the brain is facing and it has kind of two elements so one is
*  the description of kind of an informal description of what you know what ecologically is the problem
*  that the brain is trying to solve and then it the aim is to try to have some sort of formal
*  counterpart to that so and so you might say that in this envision the brain is trying to detect
*  edges in the visual field because that has all sorts of different value and you might say well
*  actually a good way of detecting edges is to compute this mathematical function and
*  and that if you compute this mathematical function it'll often pick up pick up edges
*  and that will provide a formal characterization of the problem that the brain
*  is facing in those circumstances so i don't really see how that commits you to the sort of
*  computational functionalism there's only one true computation that the brain is performing you know
*  i think that that that that kind of picture is is just as friendly towards a perspectival view
*  yeah so so not to the you know putnam theory of mind but there's a difference from what you
*  described of mar there and the view that you started out with which is you know starting with
*  just the brute complexity of the visual system and admitting well there's way more going on there
*  than any theory of vision however elaborate its models are that is that it's going to be able to
*  encapsulate but and so you know using you know that recognition of complexity as you know a way
*  to like provisionalize the claims that are there in that in being made in that theory of vision that
*  well yeah which would be the qualified claim would be well as far as we can make out given the
*  limitations of our ability to collect data and and model them this is the best way we can come
*  up with as a theory of what's going on with in this area we think it's doing edge detection and
*  look we can run that algorithm in a computer as well and we can get some simulation of vision
*  but admitting that there could be that this is only like a very provisional sketch of what is
*  of one tiny part of the process which yeah mar's own presentation of his work was not
*  was not that provisional yeah so i think actually like in mar there's something close to the point
*  about complexity and our epistemic limitations so he was reacting against the sort of trend to
*  just focus on the neurophysiology and do loads and loads of recordings of neurons and you know
*  find perceptual stimuli which would trigger certain recordings and then just
*  track all of those patterns and he was saying well what you know you're just going to find more and
*  more complex stuff that that way and we don't really know what it means what the point of all
*  of this is so you might keep on doing this project for 100 years and still not really
*  understand that much about vision you understand that certain neurons are going to correlate with
*  certain stimuli under certain conditions but what what does that really tell you about how vision
*  works and so i think that the like his his alternative which is to think about well what
*  is the problem that the visual system is trying to solve and that involves kind of abstracting away
*  from various stuff and also idealizing and so i think it's i think it's reacting in a similar way
*  to it's a very complicated domain and if you just look at recording everything you can in that domain
*  you're not going to understand that yeah i mean he i agree he's certainly reacting against
*  that reductionistic approach where you could look at the pieces and and see how putting all the
*  neurons together you might get a visual visual system and he's saying you know without a theory
*  about what vision is for you'll never you'll never be able to work this out bottom up at all
*  it's actually better to start with a top-down theory but how i think about that is you know
*  the reductionist and then the ma computationalist approach is two different bets on where they're
*  going to find simplicity and order in the brain so the reductionist thinks that just by focusing
*  on the simple components i.e. the neurons you're going to somehow see how those piece together like
*  lego bricks in order to get the complex behavior coming out whereas the ma approach is hoping to
*  find simplicity and order in the brain but at that level of computation so yeah i think that that's
*  that's right but maybe the point at which it differs from the kind of perspectivalist
*  pluralist view is if you think that there's only one kind of correct way of doing that and i don't
*  know if mar was committed to that assumption or how strongly he might have held that assumption if
*  he did how many perspectives are what's the right number of perspectives to have and what i really
*  want to ask is how much of cognition is computation right if if it's a complex mass and what you're
*  saying is part of what it's doing must must be to use the word tiny actually which i was you know it
*  is computation a tiny part of of what the brain is doing and how much of what it's doing is related
*  to cognition what quote unquote cognition because some people define cognition as computation for
*  instance and i don't know you know maybe we need to tease those apart a little bit better but but
*  you know the the question is how much of what the brain is doing is computation and this also
*  relates to masrita you talk about you know the analogy of the brain as a computer and what we
*  should expect if the brain is doing a lot more if computation is a somewhat i want to use the word
*  tiny again part of what the brain is doing we should find a lot of disanalogies as well
*  and so the so that's the question is how much of what the brain is doing should we count as
*  computation and what does that mean you know well that's that's a really hard question to
*  answer given the current state of knowledge at least when we're doing arithmetic the brain
*  is doing computation it all comes back to the math yeah so francis egan would like that i suppose
*  yeah yeah i think that that's that's that's a pretty secure
*  but i mean it really it's a real question because the field is just dominated by by computation
*  right and so if if computation either should we think of it as computation as being one little
*  thing that falls out of the rest of the processing or is or should we think like of computation as
*  just our way of dumbing it down enough so that we can describe it and think about it what's
*  happening in the brain you know how should we relate yeah i mean i i think of it in the latter
*  way but i'd also like to emphasize that if you're a serious perspectivist you give up on the
*  question of like asking well what is really truthfully literally going on in the brain and
*  you admit that you're only going to be able to see things by way of a perspective so that question
*  you know how much is it really computation and how much is something else you realize that
*  scientifically speaking you're not going to be able to answer that but then but but would you
*  commit to then say because you said computation might be a tiny thing that the brain is doing
*  then what you're saying is that the vast majority of neuroscience is focusing on a tiny thing
*  about what the brain is doing no so so i should say so the tiny thing that the brain is doing so
*  yeah literally we are doing computation when we're doing arithmetic we're doing
*  maths using our brains right yeah um well i didn't mean focusing on just the math part but yeah
*  exactly um but i didn't mean to say that there are some parts of computational neuroscience that are
*  literally honing on on the computations that are really there in the brain and the rest are wrong
*  and need to be replaced what i mean is what i really meant to say is that computation may well
*  be the best framework given the current knowledge that people have of modeling the brain and that
*  would be fine as long as you don't take that as the final story about what the brain is independently
*  of any perspective i don't want to be a perspectivist about what's going on at a physical
*  level so i think that there's only one thing going on at a physical level so some people are
*  perspectivalists about all sorts of different domains so you don't need to be a global
*  perspectivist about everything so you might think that there's just you know you're just a realist
*  about the physical stuff going on and so that's that's kind of my where i land but i'm a
*  perspectivist about the computation which is performed by the brains of the question
*  how much of the brain is computation i think is not a well-formed question so i think that the
*  question should be um which bits of brain activity are useful to model in terms of computation
*  and and and pairing with that which bits aren't yeah and i can imagine that you know
*  there are going to be certain bits which are and aren't which a computational formalism is and isn't
*  helpful to um to use as a model but um but it's not that you know there's certain bits of brain
*  activity which really are computing and other bits of which which um aren't computing and we have to
*  and identify which bits are or the computing bits which bits aren't i don't think that that's i think
*  that's to um picture computation in in kind of a according to my life it's an incorrect way
*  it's just thinking about the the applicability of a computational model or the payoff for
*  applying computational model and to that domain do you think that go ahead yeah i was just going
*  to say i i agree with that i like how mark put that do you think that neuroscience is too focused
*  on a sort of realistic view of computation as being cognition so i think that
*  yeah i think it probably is you know taking i'm asking you to be judgmental i'm sorry yeah but
*  i i'm hesitating because i think that there's um all sorts of heuristic and instrumental values
*  and holding beliefs which i don't think perhaps are correct so i think that there's
*  all sorts of value for a scientific inquirer to be a realist about computation i think that there's
*  huge value undeniable value in somebody not being a perspectivalist so someone who's in the grip of
*  their model and they think that their model is the canonical computation performed by the brain is
*  going to be highly motivated to try to apply their model as widely as they can and develop it in as
*  a you know as strong way as possible and that's that's what we want and so we want as few
*  different we don't we don't want proliferation of perspectives without
*  utility without value so we want as few models we're going to have multiple models we want as
*  few models as possible we want those models to be as wide ranging and as unifying as as possible
*  and if someone who's in the process of building a model believes that their model is the only model
*  they're going to be very strongly motivated to to develop it in that kind of virtuous way
*  as a as a heuristic that very literal ontological interpretation of one's own model could be fine
*  i mean the other thing to point out about perspectivism here is it goes with pragmatism
*  you know that approach to science which doesn't like pitch the um well i would say positively
*  speaking which never wants to forget that there are practical aims of inquiry when we're talking
*  about what scientists are doing and so to ask whether computationalism is the right framework
*  for neuroscientists you have to ask well what is the you know pragmatic goal of the research
*  and so if you look at statements of why neuroscientists are doing the kind of research
*  that they're doing they'll typically state things in the you know big position piece things about
*  understanding the brain in order to cure mental illness and neurological disease and make people's
*  lives better so really the question about the utility of the computational framework should
*  be about how well is it serving those those goals maybe this is a good time to bring in
*  artificial intelligence because the sort of implicit bet in ai is that it's all computation
*  right that anything worth that intelligence that anything that we would ascribe to intelligence
*  is all based on computation and if we take the perspective that the computation is one part that
*  that we can describe through an idealized way of what's happening in the brain then the then the
*  question is you know what are the other things that are happening from the brain whether we
*  idealize them or not what is it useful to talk about that the brain might be doing that might
*  be missing in the computational approach and if if there is something worth talking about is it also
*  worth talking about in terms of building intelligent agents it seems kind of important to get it to get
*  right and this may lead us into the the the need to naturalize computation the computational
*  theory of mine naturalize our mental properties through representation and such so i just throw
*  out a mouthful i'm sorry but maybe you have a response to the to the ai question as well
*  well i mean certainly one of the reasons why these you know programs and expectations for ai
*  especially you know going into general artificial intelligence one of one of the ways they get their
*  plausibility is certainly because people are assuming that cognition intelligence is computation
*  and so you know what's this analogous between brains and artificial neural networks is not
*  important to how is that humans are intelligent so so i think it's an you know an important
*  sociological point maybe about how a philosophical idea coming from partnum and also having its own
*  motivations within neuroscience because people are you know passionate about their own perspectives
*  of research how that that feeds into like a more general view it's out there amongst the general
*  public and technologists that you know this is a thing that is possible because thought is computation
*  yeah so so the the general intelligence is kind of the is an interesting case because it's something
*  that you know we don't really have any decent computational models often despite you know huge
*  amounts of progress in ai in recent years and development of you know much more efficient
*  machine learning algorithms and there hasn't been you know really noticeable progress on
*  general intelligence the problem of general intelligence and so philosophers often are very
*  impressed by that piece of data like the kind of the failure to really make much progress on that
*  on that hard problem and and i think that there are basically three options that there are three
*  really alternatives for explaining why that's the case and so the first is that you know we just
*  we're chipping away at the problem and we'll eventually get there so we just need slightly
*  more sophisticated computational models but we're on the right path more and more more data exactly
*  just just just give it more time it's early days the research program and second option is that we
*  need new computational techniques so something different from our current computational models
*  which perhaps haven't been thought of yet so you get all these you know interesting suggestions
*  about you know learning algorithms which don't just adjust weights and connectionist networks
*  but actually change the topology of the network kind of grow nodes remove nodes and things like
*  that so you do that so you're talking about it's about new models within deep learning
*  exactly so new entirely new computational so the space of all computational techniques
*  has in no way been fully explored there are lots and lots of options out there so perhaps a new
*  type of technique will crack the problem and the third alternative is that we need a non-computational
*  technique to get a good model of general intelligence where a purely computational
*  approach isn't sufficient and you get folks who argue for this and say that they're impressed by
*  embodiment and they think that if this is the system has to be physically embodied and has to be
*  involved in interacting with a kind of a fairly rich physical environment in order to have the
*  capacities associated with general intelligence so folks who are impressed by robotics and situated
*  cognition movement argue for this and I think it's just kind of too early to say really I don't
*  really know how anyone can confidently assign their credences across those three options at the moment
*  and I think it's at least reasonable to entertain the possibility that we may be in the in the third
*  option and that computation may not be sufficient to crack general intelligence there's only people
*  on that third option that think it's two plus three so if you have a heat well actually and one so a
*  really really really huge neural network say artificial neural network with a different
*  architecture plus ability to engage with the world yeah I think well there's there's a limit in that
*  we know that it's possible because we do it and we're presumably not magical
*  so if you built something which was very much an embodied system very much like us then then presumably
*  it would it would exhibit same properties as us including general intelligence but yeah to the
*  extent which you can get there just through computation just by running the right computation
*  it would still be very different from us if it was a robot with a massive on board computer
*  right because it would just be replacing our brains with a computer
*  yeah so so you might think so I was categorizing under the third option everything to do with
*  physical embodiment which isn't right which isn't covered by and by computation yeah whereas I was
*  thinking about you know people say like okay so gp23 doesn't understand anything but if you
*  allowed it to like interact with the stuff that it's producing text about then it would get
*  semantics and then it would get more general intelligence yeah yeah so so yeah so some of
*  the folks go that way and some some folks think that you know our general intelligence and our
*  ability to kind of determine what context we're currently in and know kind of what the current
*  problem our brains facing is so that problem of kind of context detection it's not a it's not
*  a problem which is solved purely by our brain it's not that our brain takes in like all the sensory
*  data and then what kicks out okay I'm in this context it's rather something which is solved
*  by the way in which we're embedded in certain physical environments which folks say call forth
*  or solicit certain responses so it may well be that you know whenever you're at home with the kids
*  that context that's being in that physical context calls forth certain patterns of responses which
*  solves the context determination problem for you without you having to that's that's my brain
*  computing feeling defeated being in the home with yeah exactly despair
*  yeah that's this feeling that's the computational feeling of despair or none it'd be the non
*  computational feeling yeah does does embodiment does does that encompass so so i'm trying i'm
*  just trying to think of like what might be important non-computational ways of approaching
*  and one of the reasons why i'm thinking this way is you know so for instance mark i don't know that
*  you don't have any ambitions to start a neuroscience lab and i don't think mas rita you have
*  further ambitions to go back to neuroscience but i'm wondering you know if you went back to neuroscience
*  it seems like a great challenge and a in the spirit of contrarianism to pursue a non-computational
*  perspective in inroads so if you're going to open a neuroscience lab these days and i'm only asking
*  because because i'm selfish because i think like if i were going to do this
*  what would what approach would i take what i take that would marry an alternative
*  non-computational approach sort of philosophically to a hardcore hardcore
*  to an experimental neuroscience approach and it's an unfair question because i don't have an answer
*  for it myself but you know if you were going to start a neuroscience lab like would is this
*  something that you would try to tackle because it is not well trodden territory in neuroscience
*  yeah i mean the the question this raises for me and actually mark and i were having a discussion
*  about this before we joined you is okay what gets excluded from the computational framework
*  if you have this assumption in the background that all physical systems are computationally
*  simulatable then how could i frame this research such that someone could come along and say ah but
*  you know they said that person couldn't come along and say ah but no you you're just describing
*  computational system because my first thought there with you paul was still actually well
*  maybe what i'd be most interested in looking at is say memory and sigled celled organisms because
*  you know i was listening to um gershman the other day talking about memory and paramecium is oh this
*  is really fascinating stuff because there's presumably things that are happening in multi-cellular
*  organisms like ourselves which are memory-like how does that relate to all of this Hebbian stuff
*  which is really simulable in artificial neural networks but then someone could come along to that
*  and say yeah but this is just computation but it's at that single cell scale so yeah how how
*  how are we going to define the non-computational perspective at this stage or it's not even memory
*  because memory is computational so we need to call it something else or something yeah like
*  computation has become you know it's a very rich formalism so um so yeah perhaps you know in the
*  old days when people you said computation people thought of Turing machines or people thought of
*  symbolic computation or production systems and so forth and you know that that kind of narrows the
*  space of options significantly but if you think of computation as folks do nowadays where it's really
*  you know there's a huge space of mathematical formalism so you could be really talking about
*  you know a bunch of variables which are related by differential equations you know that's
*  but but can count as a computational model of a system I want to switch gears because I I'm aware
*  of the time and I want to make sure that we talk about well rather I want to make sure that we
*  solve the problem of naturalizing mental uh mental aspects of of life and intelligence
*  and we'll do that through talk about representations representations is an open question and yet is that
*  the core of computation computationalism because what are you computing with you're computing with
*  these representations that are somehow in the mind right and there's there's a problem with
*  representation that the big problem which many words have been and centuries have been spent on
*  is how uh how are representations about something how do they get their meaning how are they
*  semantic how are they intentional how do you get that from things that that don't have semantic
*  content that don't have meaning it's the problem of naturalizing representations
*  so how close are we to solving this dilemma mark maybe you can start us off
*  so yeah um so I think that we are getting closer and slightly and so I think in the
*  right direction okay I think it's a bit like one of those endless car journeys where the kids are
*  saying you know are we nearly there yet are we nearly there yet so I think that um I think we're
*  unlikely to arrive at a clear point where we say okay this problem is being solved and but we are
*  making progress and we are chipping away at it but it will remain as a problem for the ages
*  so I think that the respect in which progress has been made and recently so I'm I really like um
*  Nicholas Shay's um recent um prize winning book on naturalizing representations called representation
*  and cognitive science and um one of the moves that um Nick Shay makes in that book is to which I
*  think is is really really sensible is to say that there are going to be cases in cases and we really
*  need to distinguish um between cases here so there isn't going to be one theory naturalistic
*  theory of content which is going to naturalize all the representations that we care about
*  and so that raises a question of how we carve up the cases um and I think again Nick does
*  a really helpful job in the book and I think that there's a kind of a growing consensus that we
*  there are roughly certain categories of cases that we need to distinguish so for example we
*  need to distinguish more kind of perceptual sensory representations from cases of higher level or more
*  abstract representations and we need to distinguish um structured representations
*  um and I think that it's a sensible thought that you're probably going to need different
*  approaches to naturalize different kinds of representations so that that that all seems great
*  um so where there's more work left to do I think that we're only at the beginning of distinguishing
*  between different cases and I think that probably you need to make finer grained distinctions um
*  I think that some cases are going to prove too messy and too dependent on pragmatic considerations
*  to naturalize so related to this I think that there's a trade-off that if you look into the
*  naturalizing representation literature which always appears that I think is is not sufficiently
*  well understood so the trade-off is between providing a naturalistic account of a given
*  representation and admitting indeterminacy in the content so often what happens is that you
*  provide a naturalistic condition on what a given cognitive state represents but that comes with
*  the consequence that there's a lot of indeterminacy in the content probably more than you are bargaining
*  for now it's kind of unclear how to what the rules of the game are here and how to manage this trade
*  off so it's not really clear how much indeterminacy is kind of okay and just you know that's something
*  unexpected thing that we've just discovered and how much is really counting as um showing that the
*  naturalization project has just failed in that case and we aren't naturalizing content at all
*  we're providing something which doesn't capture the content so I think more progress needs to be
*  made on that fundamental question about how to how to manage the trade off a final area which I
*  think that really progress could be made more we need more progress on is the question on why we're
*  trying to naturalize representational content at all so Francis Egan at Rutgers has done like
*  amazing work over the years on this and I think there's often an assumption among philosophers
*  that we just must naturalize representational content in human cognition or else disaster ensues
*  and it's not clear why that's the case at all so Egan makes the point that it may well be
*  content might be determined by naturalistic factors there might be nothing spooky or magical going on
*  but it just happens to be so messy and open-ended and dependent on pragmatic considerations that
*  you're just not going to get a manageable systematizable theory of content and for at
*  least many cases so I think asking that question why do we really need such a theory is really
*  an important one to want to do. Masrida do you want to address that because I yeah yeah yeah sure
*  yeah I I would say I'm a I'm a fan of Nick Shay's book as well I think it's a really nicely done
*  piece on that project of being you know a realist about representations
*  in cognitive science and neuroscience and showing you know that value that is had by you know
*  scientists positing representations and thinking about behaving systems in terms of representations
*  but I'm much more sympathetic with Egan's like questioning about why we also need to go into
*  this thing of naturalizing the mind because I think that we can assert the value of cognitive
*  science and neuroscience you know positing representations in animals and potentially
*  other intelligent systems as well we might one day talk about plants representing things but
*  naturalization is equated with reduction so it's actually showing how you put
*  non-semantic pieces together to get a semantic system and I think you can be as much a naturalist
*  about representations and content without thinking that you're going to have a story about how
*  those things are made up from non-semantic pieces you know just in if you look across other branches
*  of science it's not like people have gone across the board being able to reduce biology to chem
*  to chemistry you know biology is sui generis it's certainly related to the chemical but no one has
*  this complete story to tell about how the chemical pieces get put together to make an organism and I
*  think we should accept that as a very clear possibility with representations and content
*  as well what would a complete story look like because the what I might counter to that is that
*  that's fair like we don't have a complete story about whatever unit is doing in an artificial
*  neural network etc and however it's desirable like how are we going to make progress in
*  understanding minds without some naturalizing principles even you know maybe not a step by step
*  math mapping that doesn't have to be isomorphic but can transition we don't need every
*  granular discrete step along the way toward explanation but there might be useful overarching
*  principles that go ahead yeah yeah so so I think you know answers to those questions you see you
*  see them in in shay's book where he's talking about you know what is it about the systems that
*  it's useful to give you know um representation positing explanations for what is it that they're
*  doing that makes it you know that makes that practice um workable and necessary so we can
*  tell story well give explanations of what it is in the life of an organism what it's responding
*  to in its environment such that it needs to have mental states with content but that's not
*  being able to tell you especially not in general unifying terms about how those non-semantic pieces
*  build up to content but you can very much talk about content in natural situations and say well
*  there's nothing you know spooky going on there but it's just that you're not you're not doing that
*  fully fledged reduction so some philosophers have said that you know there's this kind of
*  muggle I think it's called a muggle constraint which is that you know there can't be anything
*  magical in your explanation of how cognitive phenomena are produced or how behavior is produced
*  and they say that because of this you need to be able to explain how semantic content arises
*  in step-by-step terms in terms of naturalistic step-by-step terms but it's not clear why
*  and that that seems like an awfully demanding constraint to me and for the reasons that
*  Masvidy gives and so you may well think that you know there are some very very complicated messy
*  set of factors that determine what specific content we have and in particular that cut down
*  on the indeterminacy so what happens a lot with these simple theories of representational content
*  is saying you get a lot of indeterminacy and that seems that you're not really capturing the
*  phenomena that you wanted there's too much indeterminacy in the content so when you're
*  trying to think about the factors which are going to cut down on that indeterminacy and mean that
*  this state is going to represent this and not this or this or this or this or that
*  and then you tend to appeal to various pragmatic factors and those tend to be very very difficult
*  to systematize but there's no reason to think why those are somehow magical or spooky or
*  there's anything non-naturalistic going on it's just that if you were to give a theory of it you
*  know you would never end and you would never be able to really understand it or generalize with it
*  right it's very much a case-by-case basis sort of organism environment specific and this is also in
*  Bill Wimsett's causal thicket that we're dealing with I mean this is one reason why I rather like
*  Mark Bichard's interactivism because it kind of goes down that pragmatic road
*  dealing with representations as well that in the end you know behavior is the constraint almost
*  however it turns out well that's what the representation was about you know so in
*  and that's the kind of sense that you know what I really need is a theory on what will satisfy me
*  as an as an an understander right because I realize I don't need to know what's going on with
*  with all aspects of the representation but I do need some principles to grasp and to make sense
*  of how it could be naturalized not exactly how it is but a likely story of how it could be because
*  I want to know how the mental arises from how it how to how to account for it from the physical
*  right but does this put representation in the same boat as computation in the in terms of
*  uh accounting for it in the brain and as part of what the brain is doing right you know do we need
*  to lean more on representation the higher the cognitive process we're dealing with whereas
*  maybe with super low level right at the sensory organs and a few synapses in maybe that's not
*  very representational but then we get a little bit higher into memory working memory and uh was it
*  what despair when you're traveling with your children you know that do those rely on
*  representations more so there's this research program the kind of anti-representationalist
*  research program and with lots of smart folks working in it where they try to pick various
*  cognitive capacities or various behaviors and give represent give explanations or models of
*  them that don't involve representations and they typically appeal to kind of dynamical systems
*  models so they think of people as kind of oscillators which are responding to things
*  in their environment and such like and that is quite powerful and can explain lots of stuff
*  but it tends to be stuff which is fairly close to the sensory motor boundaries so it's kind of good
*  and things like finger wagging and things like that where you can explain how
*  people are able to you know produce various kind of motor patterns and so forth
*  but those anti-representationalist research programs tend to struggle giving accounts of high
*  level high level thought and because high level thought seems intrinsically representational
*  and it's kind of been a been a sort of an unsolved problem for for the anti-representationist
*  program so the the typical cases which are given against them is to account for kind of logical
*  reasoning logical reasoning where it seems to be that you're representing things you're representing
*  numbers you're representing relations yeah but i would argue that even when you're talking about
*  sensory responses which are fairly peripheral that they're still you know much more strongly
*  driven by what's going on you know in the distal environment than what's proximal in the nervous
*  system that even then it makes sense to talk about them representing as opposed to just being
*  causally driven by by the most proximal stimulus by the most proximal
*  impulse that's true it's a really good point it's a really good point so yeah the kind of
*  variances and perceptual constancy seem to be kind of people draw on that kind of thing to say that
*  you know we should think of the what's going on in the early perceptual system as as representational
*  so so bottom line we have an optimistic view moving forward on progress naturalizing representation
*  and mental but we don't see the end point in the next month or so i think it's a it's a combination
*  of two things of progress with developing naturalistic theories and just stop worrying
*  about the problem so much yeah exactly on the condition of just lowering expectations
*  all right well you've that's a great place to end it guys no but i do want to ask so so we do need
*  to wrap up here i realize time wise but um one thing i want to ask and then and then i'll finish
*  up with the final question mazrita i'm really looking forward to your book when when the heck
*  is your book going to be coming out about simplifying the brain yeah i'm actually sitting
*  down to draft the final chapter in the next couple of weeks i have a very stringent self-imposed
*  timetable on myself but then i still need to write the introductory chapters later in the summer
*  and then i need to force all my colleagues to read the drafts to prevent me from publishing
*  something stupid so i'm aiming to submit it next year oh good well i can't wait for the book to
*  come out um mark are you working on a new book you got i mean everyone's writing books these
*  days you must have a book coming out as well yeah so i'm starting in a couple of weeks i'm
*  starting my research leave and i'm working on um defending a view which is i think in accordance
*  with mazrita so i'm really really looking forward to reading her draft and and it's also defending
*  a form of perspectivalism about and the role of computation and cognition for for for slightly
*  different but related reasons to to mazrita well that's great so um you know there was still
*  plenty that we did not get to obviously but i do want to end uh with just one question for you guys
*  and um well maybe it's more than one question so you both have thriving careers right now at
*  least from my perspective uh and i'm wondering do you feel like you're doing it right and uh i know
*  this is a very terribly broad question do you feel like you're doing it right and and if so how are
*  you doing it wrong before and then lastly the last question on top of that is uh what trait do you
*  wish you had more of as a philosopher mazrita let's let's start with you yeah um i've had so
*  little feedback in the last year compared to normal when you just talk to people and go to places and
*  actually you know ask them at dinner well what did you really think of that as opposed to you know
*  the polite zoom interaction that i have i have no sense now if i'm doing anything
*  i was hoping to end on an uplifting note but yeah so okay do you well but just in terms of broader
*  picture in your career do you feel like you have the real with the this is the with the backdrop
*  that you're both publishing a lot you're both doing fantastic work right now uh and i'm wondering
*  if you feel like you're doing fantastic work right now do you feel like you're approaching
*  things the right way like are you in the a good flow state career-wise and the way that you
*  approach things do you do you feel that way it's it's hard to know like like i said that's
*  i'm just spending a lot of time more time by myself writing than i normally would and it feels
*  less constrained because of that but also more exploratory and experimental so that's why i'll
*  be so curious to like hear from people what they make of it barks gonna be like you've gone off
*  the rails must be you've explored too far yeah what about you heart yeah so um see i i actually
*  have similar feelings to matzveta and the past year has been has been really really really tricky
*  and i think that um you know i i think that feelings of uh kind of dissatisfaction frustration
*  are i think are not unusual uh for academics uh i think that it's i would be think it'd be unusual
*  to find someone who's kind of happy with the way in which they're working right now or confident
*  that they're on the right path and i think that um yeah i love what i do i love reading and working
*  on what i'm working on and but um i often you know once i've written something i realize oh i
*  could have written that a lot easier i could have just you know why was i so inefficient in writing
*  that i feel that every podcast i do i feel that way yeah so um see uh i wish that there was some
*  way that i could work out i could be more efficient and work out in advance what i should be what i
*  should be saying um and especially whenever you look at uh you know these wonderful super productive
*  people who you know writing you know 20 30 books productive you know super yeah if you look at um
*  i don't know you know people writing hundreds of papers you know 70 books then uh you wonder well
*  you know the way in which they do that is that they probably just get it right first time and
*  um i wish i could get myself into that state is that would that be your answer to the uh what
*  trait you wish you had more of you could get it right the first time more often yeah i have no
*  idea how to how to change myself to do that i think yeah i would need to do some serious rewiring to
*  to be able to change myself into that you should take your own advice and stop worrying so much
*  about trying to solve it right take your own advice for natural to naturalizing uh
*  representations yeah i i think i often wish i could be more perfectionist so more perfectionist
*  interesting that's a lot of people wish they could be less perfectionist but you're going to go more
*  perfectionist okay that's not selling your book too well there my book's going to be imperfect and
*  sloppy and wander along paths that i shouldn't have wandered but yeah whenever whenever i worry
*  about it i think that you know i focus on the the stuff that uh the journey really and it's
*  enjoyable like the the process of intellectual inquiry that is the thing which is really really
*  rewarding and why i got into this in the first place and even if the results can be unsatisfactory
*  to your eye whenever they're produced uh the journey in intellectual inquiries is is is
*  is is really worthwhile and really well yeah really satisfying as a researcher yeah i i i get
*  that i i have to remind myself about the journey as well because mostly what i feel is just friction
*  in my own head like why am i unable to wrap my head around these 12 ideas and synthesize them
*  and make it feel more flowing but then there are those moments like recently in the past few weeks
*  there's a mountain uh about half a mile from here and i run to the mountain and i run up the mountain
*  and i run down the mountain and when i'm while i'm running i'm these past few weeks i've listened
*  to both of you for instance and while i'm running up the mountain is when i'm listening listening
*  well and then as i run down the mountain when i can breathe again i i pause it and and that's when i
*  have these wonderful thoughts that you know kind of come and go and like you know like shower
*  thoughts right and they feel like breakthroughs and those few like those moments are that's what
*  makes it worth it i think even though the rest of the time i just feel uh self-hatred essentially
*  like i'm not good enough at it etc well we don't need to uh get off the psychology chair yeah well
*  well there i have a pluralistic stance on my my self-evaluation i suppose so yeah well this is
*  as fun as i thought it was going to be i really appreciate you guys taking the time and uh just
*  the secret is you guys are you were going to be in the same office but now just a door is separating
*  you uh in in the building uh that you both work in so thanks for for dealing with that as well
*  and just thanks for for talking with me yeah thanks a lot for inviting us
*  it's been a lot of fun thank you thank you very much paul
*  brain inspired is a production of me and you i don't do advertisements you can support the
