# BI 185 Eric Yttri: Orchestrating Behavior
**Brain Inspired:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV6TDklVaaU)
*  A big open question will be one of the goals of this naturalistic behavior field moving
*  forward is how continuous is behavior, both behavior itself as well as its neural representation.
*  The general idea is that motor cortex is saying what to do and and strident was saying how
*  to do it.
*  And all this is making it sound like I have thought out my future dreams of being a I
*  had no idea we're going to talk about this.
*  Me either.
*  This is Brain Inspired, I'm Paul, and today my guest is actually my current employer.
*  As some of you know, I recently got back into the research world and in particular I work
*  in Eric Ittry's lab at Carnegie Mellon University.
*  Eric's lab studies the relationship between various kinds of behaviors and the neural
*  activity in a few brain areas known to be involved in enacting and shaping those behaviors.
*  In many of those brain areas are the motor cortex and basal ganglia.
*  And to study that he uses tools like optogenetics and neuronal recordings and stimulations in
*  mice while they perform certain tasks or in my case while they freely behave wandering
*  around an enclosed space.
*  So in this episode we talk about how Eric got to where he is now, how and why the motor
*  cortex and basal ganglia are still mysteries despite lots of theories and experimental
*  work.
*  We talk about Eric's work on trying to solve those mysteries using both trained tasks and
*  more naturalistic behavior.
*  We discuss a little bit the challenge of even answering the question what is a behavior,
*  which you would think would be a simple question but it's not, and we discuss lots more.
*  You can find relevant links in the show notes at braininspired.co.uk slash podcast slash
*  185 where you can also learn how to support this podcast on Patreon if you're feeling
*  generous.
*  You may notice if you're watching I am not in my usual studio location and that's because
*  I'm at a conference and now I must go mingle at the conference opening reception.
*  So wish me mingling luck.
*  I wish you luck in your studies and your endeavors.
*  And I'm glad you're here to mentally mingle with Eric.
*  Like me you have a non-human primate neurophysiology cognition background, very similar actually,
*  you know reaching.
*  I didn't ever do reaching but I was all saccades eye movements and you know you've done you
*  published some in eye movements.
*  And unlike me you've stayed in academia essentially and you know I went away and now I'm coming
*  you're back into the full groveling back yeah.
*  And you were you took a chance on having me in your lab but I've never asked you how like
*  your own personal take on your trajectory from those non-human primate that non-human
*  primate world to and you did some rat work and now mouse work.
*  I mean was this like a conscious decision or is it just kind of how it flowed or what?
*  Well so the rat work was in my undergrad but.
*  Oh it was okay yeah.
*  But the so I had a great education working with primates and Larry Snyder was the world's
*  best advisor.
*  But I thought a lot of the questions were getting sort of rehashed over and over again
*  and particularly for the right questions doing monkey work is absolutely vital and in some
*  ways for some questions you can only do it with non-human primates.
*  And then there were was the entire toolbox including optogenetics that was opening up
*  for mice and so I for my postdoc I interviewed at a couple mouse labs, a couple monkey labs.
*  Oh you did so you had that door open still.
*  I had that door open and was just looking for good questions and so what I ended up
*  doing when I moved to Genelia Research Campus they had were in the process of doing some
*  work training mice how to do a reaching task with a little joystick, a PlayStation 3 controller
*  with a coat hanger shoved in the end.
*  And I thought oh great I get to continue doing the reaching and what I think the non-human
*  primate stuff both the education and the sort of approach is looked really in depth at behavior
*  at a level that I think for rodents is coming online.
*  For years it was just lever presses and for reaching or saccades you look at movement
*  time you look at trajectory and the variance of those trajectories and hypometria and all
*  these things these important kinematics that now are becoming much more popular in the
*  field but when I started my postdoc 12 years ago were fairly uncommon for rodents but
*  yeah it was initially I was trying to train mice to do a center out reaching task with
*  four different directions.
*  It did not work but it's good to be ambitious sometimes but so the idea was kind of keep
*  the reaching thing going and ask some more detailed questions thanks to the trade-offs
*  the benefits of the model.
*  Yeah one of the things that I want to ask from that is so non-human primates the reason
*  that we study them is because they're as close as we can get to our brains and our cognitive
*  abilities while still being ethically okay these you know in this day and age and so all
*  these new these tasks are being adapted for things like rodents mice but they have different
*  brains and they have different cognitive abilities it's not like a direct translation
*  and I know that there's a lot of excitement in studying so on the one hand there's a lot
*  of people saying well mice they're a lot smarter than we first thought or than we gave them
*  credit for and we can study these like cognitive functions in mice right and on the other hand
*  there's pushback saying yeah but you're not necessarily studying the same cognitive
*  functions they have different brains the brains aren't perfect homologues from one you know from
*  an area let's say motor cortex from a mouse to motor cortex of a non-human primate where do you
*  where do you stand in that and have you sort of changed your mind at all through
*  you know your studies or so I actually it's interesting you went that way with the question
*  because my first response was you said oh we study monkeys because they're really close to humans
*  I've seen plenty of great human work on the area that I was studying in
*  in pridal cortex and they have two area lips and five different divisions of pridal reach region and
*  monkey brains are as similar to human brains roughly as mice are in that there's some general
*  principles pridal cortex is one thing a occipital cortex is going to be doing another
*  but there's a whole lot of differences and so I would have said I would have if you hadn't gone
*  the direction you went I would have actually said we studied or at least I studied monkey
*  behavior and monkey neurophysiology because of what a monkey can do both cognitively and in terms
*  of its behaviors now if you want to study in-depth attention or certainly saccades or
*  skilled reaching you either need a task that is made accessible to a rodent for that matter a
*  monkey or you just can't do it and so for any question you pick the appropriate model system
*  and so I'm not trying when I was studying monkeys I wasn't trying to understand the human brain
*  there are some ideas for instance pridal hemi-neglect I was causing
*  I was injecting muscimol and inactivating pridal cortex and some of the things we're looking at
*  were related to that the the pridal hemi-neglect in humans but I was interested in monkeys and now
*  that I'm studying rodents I hope that I'm uncovering some fundamental principles that apply to
*  at least mammalian brains if not vertebrate brains very broadly glossing over the fine points
*  but I when I study a mouse I'm studying a mouse and not just that I'm keenly aware as we've moved
*  into more and more naturalistic behaviors I'm studying a super inbred mouse that typically is
*  raised in a prison population and each of even within the inbred lines there's plenty of
*  nuances there so I try and keep I guess the word's not humble but I know about the mouse that I'm
*  studying and the neurons that I'm studying and I try and keep it limited to that if others can
*  take those ideas and run with them and or we look at other people's data and applies more broadly
*  fantastic but is that why you got into neuros so I got into neuroscience because I you've been
*  talking about brains and comparative you know across species right but then there's the cognitive
*  functions comparative aspect across species and I got into neuroscience because I wanted to
*  understand consciousness etc etc highfalutin stuff right and understand you know higher cognition
*  and then one way to see my trajectory is just getting like lower lower lower level
*  questions and and you know one of the things that you said and we'll talk about naturalistic
*  behaviors there's still questions like we don't really even know what motor cortex does you know
*  that it has like one function right but you get anything well I can study brains to study
*  in your case like attention intention you know in parietal areas for example and and these are
*  cognitive things that you can't necessarily study in a mouse yet maybe they're maybe they have great
*  maybe they're a great model for attention but but you're talking about brains do you think the same
*  way about cognition or have your interests changed and do you think that mice are a good
*  um animal model for that so I guess to to come at it from from my origins even as a high schooler
*  I was lucky enough to know that I wanted the job I have today what the hell way back what yeah I
*  I missed out on the whole switching your major three times so yeah maybe even as early as
*  late middle school I loved music philosophy and psychology and biology and so
*  combined philosophy psychology and biology into a field that used to be called psychobiology now
*  neuroscience and so it's always been about the brain and particularly behavior for me
*  if we can help treat diseases in humans fantastic definitely a plus and and I'd gladly and we do
*  uh go into some models of OCD in Parkinson's in order to benefit mankind and not just with
*  with knowledge the little bits that we do but uh yeah I've always been at it for the brain
*  and and with that I don't even know cognition carries a lot of weight to it
*  uh and you know I'm I make the comment that I'm super jealous of people studying sensory systems
*  particularly you know primary sensory cortices or on out towards the periphery because they have such
*  great control in the motor system um you know basic ganglia motor cortex we're closer to the output
*  the people who study all the wonderful mess in between um my hat's off to them because
*  you envy v1 people but yes I envy v1 people incredibly for for all the control that they
*  get access to but for for the the stuff between sensory motor the the cognit the cognition side
*  uh that that is a that's hard to do um and some people do it fantastically but but there's no
*  there's a real lack of roadmap there um looking in from the inside I kind of feel foolish studying
*  uh
*  cortical striatal circuits in a mammal uh when we can't even explain all the ins and outs
*  of a nematode nervous system or a fly and um so why don't you do that why don't you go to nematodes
*  I I only recently got associated give me a little bit time I do if if if I had to jump uh and
*  actually the first experiment in the lab was uh I got some slime molds and was just going to do
*  some computational modeling on their performance but yeah if I if I jumped ship from from mice
*  I would go slime mold or octopus just because so different those are two completely different
*  uh paths they are both organisms that are capable of I mean maybe this is coming back at cognition
*  they have a surprisingly complex and adept cognitive ability um and comparatively far
*  fewer moving parts um you know slime molds are just a single cell and uh octopuses are
*  it's somewhat of a distributed circuit but um you know not not nearly the neuron count of say
*  even a mouse brain um but uh yeah if I had to had to do that uh do that I I think I'd
*  I'd get wild and go with one or both of those is that a is that something that you
*  think you could split your like could you expand your lab and have a
*  half slime mold half mouse or third and third and third like could you do that would you
*  certainly not third um too much I mean in the first six months while we're waiting to get things
*  going I did have the the thought of you know growing slime mold and petri dishes in my desk
*  and and you had them right I had them uh so what happened what you haven't told me this I um I
*  take care of mice and and and my daughter much better than than I happen to take care of slime
*  molds um enough said gotcha yeah maybe your future is an octopi then
*  we'll see uh but I mean in terms of some of these questions you know we have
*  two-armed bandit and probabilistic decision making tasks going on in the lab
*  it it might be fun to see if the models that that we and our collaborators build if we can get the
*  same sort of things out of of slime molds and there's some good evidence that to large extent
*  uh you can um and so it's uh I don't see that being 50-50 but uh if an enterprising
*  probably more masters or undergraduate student said hey uh I want to play around with some slime
*  molds and ask some cool questions I would probably giggle with delight um I'll see I think you're
*  so you're setting myself up yeah undergrad or masters well I think you're under shooting
*  the dilemmas that will arise or right that because everything is will be harder than you think it is
*  and it'll turn snowball and turn into a bigger bigger project I would imagine and I think that
*  may be part of it master students are in the lab no more than two years and the typical undergrad
*  at least once a day going is probably two to three years max so um if it's a terrible idea
*  there's a much shorter clock okay fail fast right and break things yeah you don't know
*  your try unless you break things every now and then all right well um so we haven't talked any
*  real science oh you know what let me let me just interject because since we're on the topic of like
*  animal models um and and maybe we'll just kind of get this out of the way I mean you know one of
*  the things that I've been interested in the past few years is you know this recent push to use
*  artificial neural networks to study brain dynamics and parts and functions and stuff um and it struck
*  me in this conversation this would be a relevant time to ask you your thoughts on you know you
*  instead of using animals using networks right and what we can glean from artificial networks
*  um and I'm going to guess that you're not terribly interested in that approach by itself anyway
*  so my I tend to think of computational models ai
*  deep learning methods as best used as part of a circle a cycle we ask questions of the
*  biological brain we find things out and then either as a screen or to do
*  the screen because it would be hard to do all these theoretical experiments
*  in the biological brain or just difficult generally because of some
*  feature of the question itself try things out in an in silica model whatever the case may be
*  and then use those results to make predictions to come back and ask a more intelligent
*  and pointed question and several groups are taking this approach again
*  and there's lots of uh important questions out there as as someone who has always been interested
*  in the brain I'm going to be focused on the brain um and I know there there's more there
*  there are better solutions now to to to this issue but uh I know a common
*  complaint of artificial neural networks is you're placing one complex system that you
*  don't understand with another complex system you don't understand um that is not wholly true
*  anymore um and I think there's some really cool things we can do with that but I would still
*  think that we would be at least in terms of the questions that I'm most excited about we're best
*  served if we ask the hard questions uh technically hard questions of the in silica brain um and go
*  from that neural network and then uh use those results to ask better questions of the biological
*  neural network um if we if we can do that um and also not not to harp on the octopus and the slime
*  mold but so I'm you know I think in terms of mammalian brains right and modeling mammalian
*  brains especially with like deep learning models um and I guess what I'm trying to ask is like what
*  question are you interested in and maybe the maybe they're orthogonal right because you said
*  you're interested in the brain but then but then which brain right because an octopus brain is
*  very different than a mammalian brain and then there's a slime mold and stuff so and it wouldn't
*  necessarily make sense to model I mean I I guess you could you'd have to how important would it be
*  to set up okay so let me back up like one of the the successes of like deep learning models is that
*  the architecture doesn't matter as much right you you just give it a task and then it learns and
*  then lo and behold it has some like dynamics that are similar to dynamics in whatever brain area
*  you're studying and whatever cognitive task you're studying and hopefully universality holds up and
*  and everything works out great yeah but then if you probed an octopus brain in the same task I
*  would imagine you would get a different answer I mean I don't know I guess you'd have to do it
*  maybe uh and you know sort of circling back to asking the right question in the right way
*  um my my goal should probably be
*  define more to brain and behavior like things doing things that's why I've said on the
*  side despite all the benefits away from the sensory side um so you know how does a an octopus
*  figure out which arm to reach out for a tasty crab and and how does it get the arm out there
*  how does it grasp it how how does it know where it is in space and yeah figure out which of the
*  arms to use how does it decide how to to open up a jar even though it's never seen a jar before
*  and so some of the much of the allure there would be the particularly the particular differences
*  if I just wanted to understand uh how do I get an effector from point a to point b
*  um unless I was a soft body roboticist I there was no way I would approach an octopus and all
*  this is making it sound like I have thought out my future dreams of uh being uh I had no idea
*  we're gonna talk about this so me either uh yeah uh making it seem like I have plotted this out
*  much better than uh than just a few random conversations with people um but uh yeah I'm
*  sorry we're going out no no this is this is kind of cool I hope somebody reaches out and uh I
*  actually uh chaired a session at SFM this past year and there was a really cool octopus talk uh
*  there um so yeah it maybe it's in the cards uh we'll see all right let's let's get let's get back
*  to uh what you spend most of your time thinking about what you mentioned um that that something
*  was not the question that you're most interested in or the questions that you're most interested
*  in do you have a question that you're most interested in I mean that's an unfair question
*  itself I know I I think the overall extremely high level question is trying to understand
*  how circuits produce the appropriate behavior how we transform thought into action um and so this
*  encompasses decision making and sometimes you know value estimation motor control um so that's the
*  uh for the very broad question I will give the the very broad answer but I think it's still
*  appropriate um in terms of what gets me excited um and that all these things one way or another
*  fall underneath it so circuits um we study you study motor cortex and basal ganglia these days
*  mostly um and of course you know there's a motor motor cortex basal ganglia loops there's uh
*  corticocerebellum loops and stuff so so these things um are connected in loops so it is a
*  circuit but of course there's a lot of divergence and convergence within these circuits and and of
*  course cerebellum itself is still a mystery but and it's half the neurons in their whole brain
*  it's more than 70 percent isn't it I think depends on the yeah depends on the species but yeah what
*  about the octopus eric what yeah pretty sure it doesn't have a cerebellum but uh
*  show me what I know yeah yeah that's right and and I always think of that when whenever there's an
*  estimate for the number of total neurons like we have so many neurons I think yeah and they're all
*  in the cerebellum you know which is an interesting basket cells right or uh
*  no it's the it's the tiny ones that send up the parallel fiber yes stellates no uh someone's
*  gonna scientists we need to know this oh we gotta edit this out because someone's gonna yell at us
*  lots of neurons lots of neurons in the cerebellum well that that just goes to show you how neglected
*  uh the cerebellum is too right oh yeah although plenty of people study it and a lot of people
*  are saying these days I'm hearing especially from from uh philosophers for some reason
*  they they think that the cerebellum is coming back into popularity I don't know I mean it's
*  David marr is thought to be a philosopher he was a neuroscientist I mean philosophers or whoever
*  will claim him he's a computational scientist uh yeah uh I mean thinking of mars three levels of
*  analysis and all that um that comes out of largely cerebellum at least as far as I understand
*  well he had uh yeah one of the early models for the cerebellum as well um yeah which was wrapped
*  up in his uh mars levels analyses but um I mentioned the cerebellum because it's still
*  a mystery but so are you know if you open a neuroscience textbook it'll tell you um motor
*  cortex commands motor behaviors and basal ganglia depending on which textbook you open
*  uh either is a gate which allows things to happen or you know it inhibits certain actions
*  and and on and on but we really don't know I mean we know so much and there's both of these
*  brain areas motor cortex and basal ganglia are still mysteries I know that you have your own
*  uh would you call them hypotheses about uh or frameworks hypotheses about what they do
*  why don't we start there why don't we share why don't you share your ideas about what motor
*  cortex and basal ganglia are doing and then if you can just kind of hit it against a couple
*  other ideas that are uh have been studied sure uh so I think the foundation of most if not all
*  models of basal ganglia function and cortical striatodynamics
*  including the cortical basal ganglia thalamic loop
*  are largely based on the work of roger albin uh delong and and krutcher and others uh in the
*  mid to late 80s who realized that certain diseases that has affected certain populations
*  within the basal ganglia either lead to a hyperkinetic state moving more or a hypokinetic
*  state moving less and chief among these would be parkinson's disease and so that bedrock
*  serves or that serves as the bedrock for most of the existing models right now
*  um where myself and this is not anything that I invented uh
*  I'd say the the truest to that model and one that's been championed by john crackhour
*  david robbie uh rob turner who doesn't get nearly enough credit for the brilliant work he does
*  um is that uh the basic anglers serves as a modulator of vigor um you can think of vigor as
*  as uh force over time is one way to think of it there are other interpretations thereof but
*  modulating the kinematics of an action that is selected upstream presumably uh with motor cortex
*  and its friends um and um that's made sense to us in in probably the biggest paper we've had so far
*  i stimulated um either the direct or indirect pathway of the stridum and these are two
*  populations of opponent neurons in the the stridum of of mammals as well as uh most vertebrates
*  and the idea there that what we found is that we could change uh the speed of a mouse reaching
*  using a one of these joysticks uh that if we stimulate on fast reaches uh this direct pathway
*  population we would get more fast reaches we wouldn't necessarily speed up that reach but
*  we'd bias the animal um in its performance uh and if we stimuli on slow reaches we got more slow
*  reaches the opposite was true for this indirect pathway population the the chief alternate
*  hypothesis which is most often taught in textbooks or sometimes just put right next to it as if it's
*  the same thing uh is that when it comes to uh the motor side of things again
*  that the uh the direct and indirect pathways um are pro movement and anti-movement and this is
*  where the gating idea that you uh you introduced comes about that you would uh that cortex and its
*  friends would have several different uh possible actions that could be performed at any given time
*  one researcher theorized it to be around 4 000 um and that through these parallel action channels
*  the stridum selects the the direct pathway selects which one behavior to do and the indirect pathway
*  selects the 3999 to suppress where did this number come from do we know uh it was a it was based on
*  a computational model of of just what's possible um so not necessarily that the brain necessarily
*  is doing it um but um you suppress a whole lot of things you don't want and and you you facilitate
*  and promote the action that you do um and some of the leading evidence uh so so let me back up
*  this was very attractive from a computational standpoint and most of uh the much of the support
*  for this uh comes in the form of computational models where where the uh connectivity inside
*  architecture went lends itself well to an action selection uh approach um but um if
*  the evidence for it which which there's there's plenty of it uh probably the the best is lex
*  kravitz who's at uh washoe uh work that he did while he was uh at ucsf um he he stimulated the
*  direct or indirect pathway just as i did but left the laser on for 10 20 30 seconds
*  and in this case uh those neurons that were optogenically stimulated if it was direct pathway
*  stimulation the mouse would start walking after a few seconds and start and walk and if you
*  simulate the indirect pathway the sort of stop pathway um presumably because you were
*  gating off all action the the animal would stop locomoting and and wouldn't start again
*  this is fine except uh not that any optogenetic stimulation is particularly physiological but
*  um these neurons are only uh active very infrequently many most of them have baseline
*  firing rates at least in a mouse of under one hertz um and they fire very specifically around
*  movement onset at least in in trained behaviors uh as well as locomotion uh and so so that's just
*  sort of ah that you need to stimulate for these longer periods of time also the fact that it was
*  limited to locomotion if you stimulate one side it's as if you're applying either the gas or the
*  brake um to the to the to the contralateral uh side of the body but not the control side of the
*  body it's it's the turn but in order to turn left or right you need both your left and right limbs
*  and your head and and all the postural muscles of the torso um so that just sort of struck me
*  as odd and so that that was a lot of the uh the impetus for the the very brief and very selective
*  stimulation that we did so when we if we stimulated on every reach or on a subset of reaches
*  uh we observed no effect with these under half second uh pulse light to sort of just try and
*  nudge the system at a few more spikes when the neuron would normally be active we found no effect
*  on that and since then we've managed to expand this to starting and stopping
*  so in work that we should be submitting soon we we looked and saw if we if we stimulate the direct
*  pathway every time a mouse stops locomoting in the open field the suggestion of the
*  um of the of the gating uh prone anti-kinetic action selection side would be that
*  um you should just as lex demonstrated quite well if you stimulate that mouse should
*  stimulate direct pathway that mouse should take off take off walking start moving again yeah
*  yeah um what we found was was germansely the opposite uh a mouse will stay pretty much seated
*  in in for for minutes at a time if we stimulate every time the animal stops moving so looks a lot
*  more like reinforcement and along a kinetic axis of of in this case locomotor speed an indirect
*  pathway has the opposite effect the animal just more or less won't stop walking for the 20 minutes
*  in which simulation can occur i think what's really critical and that i think is an informative
*  point is the causality is the the wrong term but while we stimulate sometimes even though the direct
*  pathway stimulation biased the animal to be stopped walking to not be walking uh sometimes
*  we would get up and walk in the middle of it um so so we're we're biasing the the performance
*  we're not selecting the action and i and i think but you're stimulating you're trying to nudge
*  you're not uh you're not doing electroshock therapy we're not uh at least as far as as
*  we can tell so that might be part of it but i think the interpretation that that i think may be
*  more appropriate with our causal manipulations and in what we see with our chlorinative measures
*  like recording is that the these populations of strido neurons acts more as a game modulator
*  so whatever signal and this also has great benefits with the other motor or non-motor
*  roles ascribed to the area if you're just a game modulator and actually interesting you brought
*  up cerebellum cerebellum and and its wonderful repeated architecture serves as a computational
*  unit that in theory can be applied to any uh any input that it receives and it's going to
*  it's going to do its ltd learning wonderfulness on whatever the input is if there's any if there's
*  any part of the brain that you can almost consider in isolation the cerebellum would be it right is
*  it granule cells is that what yes granule cells that's the little one yeah um yeah whereas the
*  brain is like so intertwined and there's so many different there's so much different cross talk
*  and recursion and recursiveness that it's yeah it's just messier but the cerebellum is clean in that
*  respect ish yeah and so our idea with this other subcortical not not that it is any any cleaner in
*  in in the connectivity sense is that if it serves as a game modulator and if uh if you know some
*  basics of optimal control theory if you have a push and a pull on any feature that you might
*  want to control it gives you a lot better control to have that push and pull than just the push
*  some people say oh but i can drive my car with just the gas if you needed to drive at 34.3 miles
*  per hour you would want to have a foot on both the gas and the brake to control that
*  and so if these neurons are acting as a game modulator of whatever the incoming signal is
*  um that applied in a certain fashion uh getting back to how you ask your questions
*  that can look like action selection because of of turning that that volume knob as it were
*  doing that game modulation depending on the inputs and that's viewed for through a very specific
*  lens when looking at vigor it's more obvious there that it would be doing that and then plenty
*  of people look at the basic angle and the stratum in in terms of its cognitive or auditory processing
*  or all sorts of things um and and to to get back at sort of these what is the brain doing and and
*  are there any sort of fundamental properties of neural circuits it seems like you could copy and
*  paste this computational unit of uh we have a we've called it a history dependent gain modulator
*  so it's getting feedback information from from dopaminergic cells and all sorts of convergent
*  inputs from all over the brain it would be a really good system and our experimental evidence
*  suggests it's a great way to pair descending inputs feedback from your from your dopamine system
*  and to alter to tweak those descending inputs and either have it be a feedback system or
*  in many organisms a majority of the output of the basic angle is feed forward down to
*  brainstem nuclei superior colliculus etc for for for mammals and and so that be and those same
*  nuclei are getting convergent inputs from these cortical areas as well so
*  um yeah there's a a beautiful paper that that josh dubbin wrote uh with john crackauer we also
*  had one with hit the word history dependent gain uh in the title sort of of uh pushing this idea
*  um but yeah that's where where we stand um i still have a job so it's certainly not um figured out
*  one way or another and we're going after these things but yeah the general idea is that motor
*  cortex not necessarily m1 specifically but motor cortex is is saying what to do um and and strident
*  was saying how to do it um and it actually um i think about my monkey work quite a bit because
*  even in a visual sensory motor area like li p or pridal reach region i knew 150 milliseconds or
*  300 milliseconds ahead of time if that monkey was going to saccade left or right use its left or
*  right arm to reach um and so just the the timelines of of of the action selection model
*  have never quite made sense to me but uh but a game you can have a game modulator that acts as a
*  action selector in the extremes right so so in a sense i mean this goes back to like what does
*  brain area x do well it's not like one function because it can under those two alternative
*  hypotheses it can actually be both absolutely um there's some reasons why why and and i said you
*  know view feed through the a specific light it can it can look like action selection um i think
*  there's some other more nuanced work that that suggests that that's actual action selection might
*  not be what's going on um but um actual action selection as opposed to game modulation action
*  selection yeah yeah yeah action something like that um it could certainly look like it but if
*  it's performing a selection between many possible actions that i right right the way it's written
*  up in the textbooks that's the actual action selection you're just you're talking about
*  that's the the the better way to to get at that i think um maybe we go back and edit that one too
*  uh but yeah um so so it can look like action selection um but i think for for selecting between
*  dozens of possible actions um the evidence just isn't there and we have a um a few lines of of
*  evidence that suggests that that um but that's also not the case but it's yeah it's still
*  still an open question um in fact uh uh writing a perspective piece right now uh with um several
*  um a dozen authors on just sort of trying to come to terms with these competing hypotheses
*  um and some of the original you know i talked about the bedrock theory on
*  hypo and hyperkinetic modalities um the some of the people who came up with with those models have
*  said guys you've been using the same model since the mid 80s maybe you should get creative and move
*  on to something else but if you read a basic ganglia or corticosteroidal paper
*  uh you're almost required to cite albin and delong brilliant guys uh but um
*  yeah there there is some some doctrine in there to to deal with part of what you've been talking
*  about especially with basal ganglia and this holds for motor cortex as well but but your
*  experiments on basal ganglia also showed this uh and basal ganglia also is also wrapped up with
*  the story of learning right very involved in learning and and part of your stimulation
*  experiments showed like showed that that gain modulation is learned and lasts for some time
*  yes either whichever way you stimulate uh the for the faster or for the slower um it lasts for some
*  time it followed the policy right which is policy learning is a beautiful form of learning yeah so
*  i don't i'm not sure if right now is the the right time to pivot too so this is all in the in the
*  context of training animals to perform tasks to move these joysticks right and then you do some
*  causal manipulations some stimulation and you're recording neurons and and the organisms have to
*  learn the task they have to put effort into the task etc and so that's a large part of your
*  history and current research is studying these tasks and and how learning is affected and and the
*  kinematics and what's happening at the neural level and and you've taken kind of a recent turn
*  as has a lot of the field into quote unquote naturalistic
*  neuroecological is that the term ethological oh i say etho is it etho uh you said echo uh did
*  i say ecological oh oh okay we have not gone out to we got invited to to study elephants in the
*  nature reserve but we have not uh we've not taking them off of that yeah yes that one yeah
*  neuroethylogic etholod you say neuroethylogical or neuroethylogical uh for for neuro it's neuro
*  to me which is the last person you should trust um especially as your employer uh
*  i say neuroethylogy but i it's neuroethylogical
*  uh anyway the turn toward naturalistic behaviors neuro ethyology yeah yeah well i wanted to say
*  neuroethylogical behaviors again but neuroethylogy encompasses it's redundant to say behaviors again
*  neuroethylogy behaviors in there right where there is so so in the in the case of um what
*  you've done thus far is it's in your case it's you know letting a mouse just kind of explore
*  uh a space giving it there's no task right there's no reward to earn there's no skill to learn so
*  these are kind of like innate kinds of behaviors um and and just recording neurons right in in
*  motor cortex and in basal ganglia and and seeing how these areas and and the access of what you
*  call the access of uh in one basal ganglia motor basal ganglia access access um seeing what's
*  happening in these brain areas during these naturalistic behaviors and and so i i don't i
*  don't think i've ever asked you what you expected to find in the first place so i don't know that i
*  had a real expectation of what i wanted to find um the motivation behind it really is is what we
*  were just talking about of if this is uh if the basal ganglia do uh action selection or if
*  uh cortex is what action to do um the fact that our behavioral space for actions is to press a
*  lever or not or or to to move a joystick to turn left and right um which is sort of baked into
*  to the problem of if you stimulate uh for for 20 seconds and and the only behavioral output
*  in that paradigm is it walks more uh it takes a little bit but it walks more that's something
*  not to denigrate that that's something it's huge um um and at the time that was uh 12 years ago um
*  that was monumental still is um the but part of the the motivation to get into
*  more ethological behaviors and more i'd say the our focus is more on on the spontaneous side the
*  untrained uh part of it uh is because now the action uh space that you're selecting from is
*  one much bigger it's not turn left or turn right it also is unencumbered by the potential caveats
*  of training or overtraining or the fact that most mice don't see a joystick
*  as they're walking through the woods um so so that was a big motivation to try and figure out
*  what these circuits are doing um is to let nature make a lot more of the decisions so that opens up
*  our behavioral parameter space which may open up our neural dimensionality
*  and we have some initial evidence that that is the case um not as big as as i thought but
*  that that sort of remains to be to be nailed down um i'll interject here and just say just
*  as a point of um i guess education and we talked about a lot about it on the podcast but
*  modern neuroscience is kind of enamored with these dimensionality reduction techniques that work
*  especially well in constrained laboratory tasks like reaching where there is a very
*  specific movement that an animal will make in you know various directions right and then you
*  take a high dimensional data recording let's say thousands of neurons and you can
*  use dimensionality reduction techniques and then instead of reading out the thousand
*  dimensional neural activity you reduce it down to a few important dimensions based on the variance
*  of how all these neurons are co-varying with each other and etc and then you can plot out the
*  trajectory of this low dimensional trajectory and there are distinct trajectories for let's
*  say different arm reach directions right and and this has been kind of a powerful way to consider
*  especially what's happening in motor cortex um uh and in motor areas in general
*  and why did i interject that i i interjected that because um
*  oh right so i highlighted that that's been very effective especially in these constrained tasks
*  and so it's an open question of whether in these unconstrained kind of naturalistic tasks that
*  you're going for now whether that same kind of dimensionality reduction approach will be
*  as effective or what will come of it essentially right and we know that when it comes to
*  just simple uh in the most basic and and maybe abstract form of neural encoding
*  we know lots of neurons behave have firing rates and responses like lots of other neurons and this
*  redundancy of representation almost has to happen no matter how you think the brain is organized
*  organizing itself we are losing and gaining tons of neurons all the time as adults it's more on
*  the losing side but we aren't fundamentally different because of that and so the idea of
*  saying hey can we take these thousand neurons that are some of them are more like each other
*  than others they're all their own maybe special snowflakes but we can we can get a composite
*  distilled down summary out of these neurons i think has to be the case no matter what but you're right
*  i think when it comes to the dimensionality of representations
*  as well as the complexity of of these dimensions people like to talk about manifolds
*  which is sort of the the the shape that that these neural trajectories take on
*  we don't know about the complexity of of how many dimensions how many of these if you think of each
*  dimension as a feature that may be repeated or shared to some extent between several neurons
*  we don't know how many there are and how complex that is sort of laid out
*  and that's one of the reasons that we're we're getting into this because if you train and train
*  and train an animal to do a task and they only have one thing to worry about
*  it's reasonable from a strictly hand-waving perspective to think well we might be able to
*  we might not be getting the whole picture the brain the brain is sort of in in this
*  i don't want to say default state that terms taken in the simplistic state of of just needing to do
*  whatever you're going to do and we only hear from active neurons anyways so so there may be plenty
*  of other neurons that that are always representing other dimensions of behavior or whatever else is
*  going on for the brain that you'll just never see in this in this format i'd say one other part is
*  that that overtraining itself besides the fact that these are typically much are very simple
*  things the overtraining part of it the practice and practice and practice
*  may have and almost always goal directed i think is a factor that is is rarely brought up
*  it may have profound changes on how we interpret those signals and and it's been known for years
*  that if you put your electrode in the brain early on in training and this is across species
*  is a trial across many tasks and even if you try and match the the kinematics of of of individual
*  trials as best you can early on training you do not get the the pretty response profiles that you
*  that you associate with well-trained tasks at a single neuron or population level
*  are they there maybe something has to be going on but it's not not very obvious
*  what's going on it's not like you you were let's say it's a reaching task it's not like you were
*  unable to reach before it's just that you haven't been reaching in that context under that goal
*  directedness in that specific location that you need to be within a few millimeters of a certain
*  area to get a reward and so there's a lot going on it's and you're really shaping the brain in
*  in that case to reach in a certain manner so it's like you're creating something to study it so
*  you're not studying reaching or behavior reaching behavior in general you're studying reaching
*  behavior in a very specified goal oriented task under reduced conditions etc right yeah and and i
*  i don't mean to pick on reaching in particular yeah i mean i that task is is still being done
*  in our lab and there's some great work but just to make my perspective clear
*  you said that a little bit sort of tongue in tongue in cheek that that oh this is way too
*  abstracted and there's all these potential problems once again the right approach for the right
*  question is is is fantastic and so we have a senior grad student mark nicolas who is getting
*  after this what does motor cortex do and what does striatum do and lesion motor cortex in a
*  reaching task and lo and behold without m1 if you look immediately after and in the days after
*  that lesion happens mouse can't do that task it can still walk and and so in the second part of
*  of the paper we actually look at a mouse walking down a hallway it walks pretty well until it has
*  to make a decision and sylvia arbor and several other groups have similar similar effects to this
*  but but in this case again a trained artificial task can be very useful in this case we're trying
*  to complement both sides of it of the well-trained and the spontaneous when we have the animal
*  walking down the hall there's no reward but but i will say you know you you listed off
*  listed off you know the different goals of you know you have to be within a centimeter of the
*  target or the reward all these facets that you you just named a minute ago and several more
*  are are really important to us and why we are going after these more naturalistic
*  spontaneous behaviors and and applying algorithms to try and give the same structure that we would
*  have with our trained trials and we've had a fair amount of success with that but looking at if we
*  pull that away and we'll soon be starting to to sort of pepper in some of those caveats that you
*  mentioned of oh but what if this is a for reward or what if this is a fairly repeated within a
*  certain context behavior trying to to build a bridge but you're right in a sense although
*  i don't think things will be night and day different there's a lot of opportunity for learning
*  um what the brain does in its spontaneously generating behavior state um and again
*  you you were focusing on learning before we're constantly learning sometimes we're focused on
*  learning or not but if we can't learn a particular behavior learn how to interact with something
*  our our fitness goes down and we're not going to pass on our genes so um so this is
*  the the tasks certainly have a have a place have their place in neuroscience and in
*  ethology itself um because it's it's not that sure yeah this animal is created as an adult with
*  everything it's ever going to do and it's never going to update according to the the
*  chaos and conflict in its environment yeah so so it's all important one of the things that you
*  said to me maybe months ago i don't remember if you said this the first time you've been in
*  a lot that long well it's been a few months but anyway it has stuck with me is that
*  we it's a very simple point and but it but it really stuck with me we're like you and i right
*  now are behaving when you're sitting down doing nothing you're behaving i'm doing so many things
*  when i'm sitting down doing nothing you are not everybody is you are we know the octopus
*  is doing nothing when it's sitting but yeah no but but i mean i think it's a that's one of the
*  i think it's a that's one of the challenges right is you know for example what is a behavior which
*  is a very simple question that we don't have a great answer to but it's been you know studies
*  philosophically for a long time etc but you know just the fact that you and i right now are behaving
*  and uh presumably you know our brain presumably our brains are um have something to do with that
*  behavior let's say that there's a correlation between our brain activity and our behaviors
*  right now at least let's hope so yeah let's hope so and so when you have a mouse just you know
*  it's kind of wandering around and exploring naturalistically behaving a lot of the time
*  just kind of sitting there and might kind of turn a little bit and and there are all these nuances
*  that are just that neuroscience for decades has sought to get rid of so that we can control
*  exactly what we can measure and so that we're measuring a repeated
*  behavior over and over so that we so then we can average the trials together and look at the
*  average neural response and then compare conditions and if it's if if these 30 trials in this condition
*  then we can compare it to 30 trials in that condition but then all of a sudden you have to
*  kind of throw that out the window which i think comes with challenges um and is exciting as well
*  yeah yeah and so you hit on a couple really important points there um we are constantly
*  in the middle of doing a behavior and it can even the behaviors that we think we understand it can be
*  very complex to get back to reaching again in order to extend your hand out or to pull it back
*  towards you you know we always think oh the shoulder and bicep and you're engaging all of
*  your trunk muscles and and the opposite side that's why my core is so strong i do i'm reaching a lot
*  that's how i work out my core uh your core is probably far better than mine um and i'd love uh
*  i teach systems neuroscience to to the undergrads here and i love the example in the book that if
*  you're to pull a door open the first muscles to engage are your calf muscles because they've got
*  to be able to pull you backward so that you can pull against the door unless you really just got
*  to pull you're gonna slam into the door yeah i've done that too uh more often it's the pushing and
*  the door fails to move yes i don't know how to read uh there's a gary loss and one of my favorites
*  oh yeah uh school of the gifted yeah um anyway to hash that to flush that out the door says pull i
*  think and he's pushing on the door and then above the door there's a sign that says school for the
*  gifted something like that common sense ain't so common uh so so right we're constantly in in in a
*  behavior uh which does make some of the these uh tasks a little bit curious that that uh we think
*  the behavior as starting at point x uh and then once they get to the target it's done same thing
*  with learning um many people in the lab have probably heard uh dozens if not hundreds of times
*  that the fact that we're always updating our internal models we're always learning and that
*  i get why some papers will say oh learning is here and performance is here there's going to be
*  different sort of times when when there's more focus but it's it's more likely how accurate or
*  how much do you have to update your model you're i i think you're constantly
*  tweaking and and updating and there's good evidence for this um so so yeah there's a
*  lot going on um and in terms of all of those nuances we do our best um so a few years ago
*  an insanely gifted graduate student alex sue we we came out with a platform called b side
*  spelled b soid um which all sounds the same if you say it with a brooklyn accent i'm not going
*  to do it on this show oh i know better than that uh but uh you can do it if you'd like to
*  i'm all right thanks i really wanted to hear you do i i would butcher it so i i did just a hair of
*  it um okay yeah i think um anyways uh that takes pose estimation data for instance deep cut sleep
*  deep lab cut open pose these are these are modern tools that i'm sorry yeah yeah well
*  you'll do it better than i do computer computer vision algorithms that that reduce the thousands
*  of pixels into a video down to key points uh that are essentially motion capture suits on
*  uh on an individual but uh does so with modern computer vision techniques um and so we can
*  take those data which are very informative much more informative than the average pixel in a video
*  and we look at the spatial temporal pattern of those movements and anyone who has seen a
*  motion capture suit you know you can tell when someone is walking or jumping up and down
*  um just by the 12 points that you see on the body and so b-side is a an unsupervised
*  an unsupervised learning algorithm that identifies spatial temporal patterns in those points
*  and adds interpret interoperability to the the pose estimation data by extracting those spatial
*  temporal patterns that we would call behavior um the code itself will work on anything where you
*  need pattern recognition so we've used that to get at trying to identify behaviors and uh what
*  it ends up spitting out is essentially categorical variables that correspond to these kind of repeated
*  motifs that you might consider locomotion or turning left turning right things like that that
*  it groups that it clusters into these common motifs right it only knows it as group two group
*  12 but it turns out quite nicely that they tend to map on quite well to establish ethological
*  behaviors um like locomotion we actually got there's sort of three canonical types of grooming a mouse
*  will do of the sort of the face the bigger motion of the head if you think of a cat or a dog sort
*  of pulling its ear down to clean that's the head groom and then turning back to groom the body
*  we didn't tell it anything uh and that's sort of the the the beauty of of an unsupervised approach
*  um whatever you pull out is has some measure of robustness to it or believability in a sense
*  and we we readily get the get those uh three different groups uh of behaviors so we have
*  that in our toolkit we actually have a paper that that just came out in nature methods for
*  a supervised approach quote so we call it a side we're staying with the the record
*  dad joke of the a side and b side where you might find a deep cut um the uh that's a reach i like it
*  i like it it's a that's that's the basics behind it uh our our emblem actually for a side is uh is
*  a record with an a on it um someone uh i was at a workshop uh recently um and someone said we should
*  get what was it uh get get a version that's specific for fish and call it seaside um or
*  we've got yeah that one was i was both very proud and a little bit disappointed that i didn't come
*  up with it myself right yeah i'm likely thinking of d now but let yeah d side might actually happen
*  so so currently a side is is both this unsupervised b side as well as a side and you can decide
*  sorry where you get into the the behavioral segmentation uh side of things but for for more
*  nuanced or specific behaviors that supervise i can be uh really important um and it's a
*  both of them are powerful tools again pick the pick the right approach for the right question
*  uh but we've been using that to try to get us some sort of handle on these naturalistic
*  spontaneous behaviors um and the fact that it maps on to uh what the thologists have have been
*  sort of honed in on for for decades makes me feel better about the results um and that serves as a
*  jumping off point for then oh if we subdivide into longer or shorter grooming or rearing or
*  locomotive bouts or faster or slower um or other dimensions that we can make things more similar
*  we can get into those nuances but but we have a starting point um and something that
*  i in any talk i give uh on this that i make a a big point out of is you mentioned before
*  we don't know what motor cortex is doing i think we have a better idea now than we ever have but
*  you know especially for these naturalistic behaviors
*  um and in fact what we found is throughout motor cortex uh dorsal striatum and to some extent even
*  in ventral striatum um although the the reasons why we think this uh why we see the ventral
*  striatum i think are different we have a robust response that's specific to each type of behavior
*  and certainly in the naturalistic behavior we have a robust response that's specific to each type of
*  behavior and certainly in our deeper layers of motor cortex and dorsal striatum with just a very
*  simple simple decoder we can predict which of 16 behaviors a mouse is doing from just spike counts
*  at a rate of around 60 with a f1 adjusted score which is
*  uh one over 16 is a lot smaller than 60 um so there's something there um it's not 100 if it was
*  100 i i would know we were wrong uh in part because that's just not how biology works um but uh yeah
*  103 percent then that's not how math works uh
*  uh but yeah the it gives us uh some new abilities to ask questions about what is action what is
*  behavior what in in a naturalistic state that evolution is is more often pushed these animals
*  towards uh how are these things represented how are the decisions made
*  how does learning and adapting of of these of these dimensions of representation change
*  and certainly thanks to tools like neuro pixels uh and other recording modalities
*  we can start asking not just what does a handful of neurons within one area but
*  how do multiple areas interact um and so we have complex uh or i'd say a rich account of behavior
*  and a rich account of neural activity um to trying get that that abstract thought to action
*  how is that transformation made i wish um you were busy this afternoon i wish i wish uh i had
*  we had we had taken a few minutes like i should have shown i could have shown you these um
*  trajectories in gpfa it'll be tomorrow tomorrow we'll do it then great so you'll just have to
*  publish it sure you bet real soon and discuss it on here and yeah i'll come on the brain inspired
*  podcast and talk about it
*  it's trying nepotism at its best yes narcissism at its best that would be oh yeah i guess for you
*  i would interview myself right yeah and i i will say uh if anyone's watching the video i'm gonna
*  undo this uh paul specifically requested that i i did and i really i was it was a half joke but i'm
*  okay so so you actually wear that when you teach that's a i put on a bow tie for for teaching i've
*  loved bow ties for years and it's a nice opportunity because i'll admit um one thing i love about
*  academia um at least more on the on the science side than the engineering side i can come to
*  work in sweatpants um and that's what i normally do and do yeah that's right yeah which uh bow ties
*  and sweatpants although i do have a somewhat eclectic fashion style that you do i can vouch
*  for that i know better than bow tie and sweatpants um i've learned over the years well thank you for
*  for wearing it i i appreciate it that you didn't i did it in half jest and you actually came through
*  for me so i appreciate it you gotta support your uh you gotta support the people in your lab that's
*  right that's right so while you were talking about you know some of the challenges and and
*  some of the tools that we have and how b-side can categorize these things and it and it turns out
*  that it matches very well the categories that b-side comes up with matches very well to what
*  has been described in the past by human eyes you know by a thought ethologists um and i was reflecting
*  on our earlier conversation about artificial networks and using them
*  to study things in cognitive neuroscience and this is a case where like behavior
*  is a continuous ongoing thing and we're just talking about the syllables and motifs right and
*  so in a sense what we're doing is saying well how can we apply this the old way of doing things
*  to this new kind of continuous flowing behavior right so we want to break it down into things
*  that we can chunks that we could discrete chunks that we can study right and say it's
*  what does it handle so yeah when does it start when does it stop um and in a sense then you
*  could use like so so what i was thinking is that an artificial network well you just turn it off
*  and come back tomorrow and you you can't do that with behavior right which is just a continuous
*  i mean you can study it tomorrow i mean comas exist but um you're not behaving during a coma
*  i what about sleep
*  sleep is a is a funny one um anyway before we get on move on yeah so i do want to come back to that
*  but it just struck me that you know have you had emory brown on the podcast i have not but um he's
*  on the list yeah yeah he asked him that question okay whether sleep is a behavior is behaving
*  yeah and the multiple consciousnesses thereof right yeah yeah his specialty and coma
*  yeah i will say we b-side can pull out uh we weren't no we we don't we are not approved
*  for an i-code for that uh the uh it it does pull out different poses um and we've noticed
*  that there's different um frequency band during sleep uh that we have noticed different frequency
*  bands related to those poses um and i believe there's been a paper or two that through other
*  means i forgot if it was a an automated method or not um has some correlation there so
*  yeah yeah not the answer you're you're you're looking for is of behavior but uh b-side
*  categories may apply to different stages of sleep um but anyways you were gonna ask something far
*  more no i was just noting noting that you can turn computers off essentially right so using
*  an artificial network which you you know run a pass through and yes you you can study the
*  like dynamics which has been when you study recurrent neural networks to compare them to
*  the dynamics of like decision making in brains you can compare the dynamics but anyway yeah
*  anyway i was reflecting on the the fact that artificial networks are static entities and
*  living organisms are ever-changing ever-behaving constantly continuous uh behavior neural activity
*  flow and it's just a fundamental difference though the turning it off i don't see it as that
*  much of a difference i'd say it's more the initialization uh because also certainly uh
*  an an a and n or or deep net can continue to learn or or run and change and do whatever it's
*  it's going to do given the opportunity and and you know provide new information to it um but
*  i think i was thinking mostly in terms of it's going to spit out a discrete thing and then it's
*  going to spit out another discrete thing and that's kind of what we're getting at by so i'm i there's
*  a tension in me about applying that kind of approach to studying something that i see as continuous
*  and that is a big open question that i think that will be one of the goals uh of this
*  naturalistic behavior field moving forward is how continuous is is behavior both behavior itself
*  as well as its neural representation um because yeah although we can identify
*  motifs for these individual naturalistic behaviors pretty well surprisingly well um so i think we've
*  we've made a decent foothold there um it's gonna be messy it almost has to be messy
*  and i think in better word for messy i think would be uh complexity and it may be that in some areas
*  you know spinal cord it's not going to be a lot of messiness um there'll still be plenty of complexity
*  and there's constantly just incredible work being being done done on that side of things
*  good cover but but it's good recovery oh yeah i know what to do but that's going to be a lot
*  closer to the muscle and and it kind of has to be a more straightforward
*  uh something closer to a linear operator whereas you get into
*  you know motor cortex or or these cognitive areas where i'm sure if we plunk down an electrode into
*  uh you know anterior cingulate or pfc ofc power cortex name your favorite area i bet you we can
*  still find a decoder for behavior who knows v1 yeah you there may i wouldn't be entirely
*  surprised if we can do well above chance from v1 it's not the first experiment i'm going to do
*  but in just getting at the complexity and and and the sort of fidelity to the to the
*  discontinuous idea of you're doing behavior a and then you're doing behavior b
*  we can get a sense of how these are orchestrated and how that information is handed off
*  from one area to another and the computational uh process of how these are orchestrated and
*  processes that that are are going on we have a in this paper that's in the works
*  not only do we show that that we can get a robust response from individual neurons
*  for for all the some amount of neurons for all these areas motor cortex is much more promiscuous
*  in what it shows a tuning for in terms of the behaviors so the average neuron in motor cortex
*  particularly layer five will respond to four five six even eight of the 16 behaviors that we're
*  keying in on whereas when we look at dorsal striatum we see much more sparsity in its
*  representation talking two or three behaviors and and so these market differences which are
*  are sort of related to this idea of how continuous or discontinuous
*  behavior truly is i i think are important because at the end of the day we got to do whatever we're
*  going to do but there's a whole lot of fudge room in there for far more complex things we are not
*  automatons and so this is also part of my difficulty with the action selection idea of
*  the idea that that discrete action channels although that that model has plenty of attractive
*  things in terms of a theoretical computation that that's fun to play with the math or as well as a
*  useful uh uh framework through which to view brain and behavior how you would actually form an
*  action channel and the discreteness that that implies um i'm not saying that my half-baked
*  ideas are any better but though that that has always rubbed me the wrong way fair enough so
*  yeah we'll see just how discontinuous behavior is and almost certainly it
*  different behaviors will will will occupy different parts of this complex of this complexity spectrum
*  um and so yeah we're actually um recently struck up a uh a collaboration with jersey mora who's
*  one of the the fathers of recent signal processing work and i'm excited to have that um and really
*  anyone who who is is capable of asking some of these questions that i think are
*  um you know like any question this in neuroscience there's going to be some assumptions but it
*  there's a a lot of openness um and and unknowns that that i think we can make some real headway on
*  um so that's i imagine more mora lab will will focus on this naturalistic side but it's still
*  uh asking the question of uh of how these circuits
*  locally and and in aggregate lead to the behavior of interest um it's going to be exciting for a
*  while and not just us so many cool people doing it um there's a lot of people doing it that's for
*  sure it's going to be exciting for a while um and then i'll move to octopus and you'll move to octopus
*  and then you'll move to octopus we're in kind of a i don't i i probably every scientist says this
*  in the midst of their quote-unquote time but it seems like we're in an exciting time because
*  computationally we're way more powerful all of us in the past 10 years and it's just continuing
*  to increase we can record more neurons than ever um we have more tools optogenetics right we can
*  track neurons and stimulate them and watch them on the so on the other hand it opens like challenges
*  of how to use the tools correctly how do you how to ask the right questions with the tools
*  right and you it's like a confluence of all these things and now the move into naturalistic behavior
*  so there's a lot to to look at right with our neuroethological behavior there's a lot to look
*  at with these new tools i did that without a hitch um so and i earlier i asked you if if there's you
*  know anything you missed about the old days right uh working with non-human primates with recording
*  less neurons you'd go down with a single single uh electrode usually and just listen for the
*  uh yeah it sounds like it's doing what you wanted to be doing and you record it and there's something
*  wonderfully simple about that and things are not as simple anymore everything's a high uh low
*  dimensional manifold from you know recording your high dimensional data etc etc and there's a lot more
*  statics statistical analyses available does a part of you wish that you were a neuroscientist
*  a hundred years ago or you know would you if you had to choose would you would you go back and be
*  a neuroscientist 50 years ago or would you be right now or would you be 50 years from now if you had
*  to transport yourself or not as a curious person 100 years from now is ideal because we'll know a
*  whole lot more um i don't care if i'm right or wrong uh i love that about you by the way
*  i uh i think i think it's a a critical part about uh about science but um
*  as it was phrased to me by one person someone disproved uh it uh it was during grad school
*  greg d angeles while we still at washoe uh it says someone cared enough to prove you wrong
*  uh and still reading your papers but no i want to know what the i want to know what the uh the
*  answers are as a curious person um so yeah i'd pick the future because it'll take a while and
*  i think you mentioned our our experimental tools being very robust now uh we have uh
*  carcin and others uh person stream sorry uh recording you know tens of thousands of neurons
*  with calcium imaging um and allen institute and all the uh josh seagull and dozens of others
*  with their all their electrodes next diamonds um so we have tons of or even just with the single
*  neuro pixels probe uh we have tons and tons of neurons and constantly more complex behaviors
*  trained and otherwise uh the annoying question that i like to ask people is if you could record
*  action potentials from every neuron in the brain how would that change your science classic annoying
*  question oh yeah um and and typically the best answer i get is uh i wouldn't have to do as many
*  experiments because i would have my n for neurons would be very very big you'd have the date only
*  data that you needed yeah which is great uh but um yeah i i will say that i i hope and and i'm
*  optimistic that in the next few years we will have more tools to deal with uh as the volumes of data
*  that that you pointed out which are made possible by by new experimental tools um but i think to to
*  the answer that that was about to say is as a neuroscientist uh yeah i would prefer 50 years
*  ago to to 100 years from now um oh that's interesting in part because of of what i find
*  really exciting i mean if you look 50 years ago would have been oh that's a scary thought uh
*  1974 i know it's already like late in the game in terms of a lot of things that we that are like
*  the classic things that have already been discovered essentially yeah so so um i mean i still think
*  2005 was six years ago but uh that's a that's a different topic yes but i mean yeah he got i mean
*  i mean think about all the titans you know mount castle ever to georgopolis uh works um i mean these
*  are mainly the motor people echoes speaking of of uh sarabellum although most of his stuff was a bit
*  earlier um uh you've got all the great stuff in v1 still sort of uh happening though i guess
*  still a little bit earlier yeah you have all these pillars of of findings um and sort of uh
*  in a very small way and also to be clear uh i am not saying that i am uh i'm far with eagles but
*  the sort of questions that all of them were were were going after are what really would excite me
*  i mean i i just showed a video of hubo and weasel with their their light beam um that that's sort of
*  the classic they move it across the screen and you can hear the each action potential from a
*  neuron v1 i got so many weird looks setting up my lab i said that i need every amplifier to come
*  with a speaker so i can listen in on a neuron if i want to why is that weird you're speaking to the
*  choir you're preaching yeah it's a it's a holdover from platinum meridian single unit electrodes in
*  a monkey um but but it is so satisfying um i'm glad to have my my uh multi-channel electrodes
*  um but no one hears very many people yeah hear the hear the you have to tone it into tune it into
*  just one of 384 channels yeah yeah which you can do we've done it in lab uh but the the the sort of
*  questions that they were after and the way they went about it um there there is something i don't
*  think it's a it's a uh uh romanticizing it but um i think there's the questions and the approaches
*  that that i think are a whole lot of fun are when that's kind of like what we have for naturalistic
*  behavior there's it right you said it's it's exploratory we don't necessarily know up from down
*  um and that there are likely hopefully not kind of would um some low hanging
*  principles that that probably low hanging fruit of principles that that may we may be able to
*  get at that you know years and years in the in the future there's still the the the new
*  principles to be found but but they're more niche you've you've moved down the the the
*  dendrograms of your sub sub subfield more and more um so so there's something sort of
*  exciting to me uh the creative approaches uh yeah i mean really single the the same
*  uh single unit recording that we're talking about it was still in the infancy 50 years ago
*  which is something that we don't necessarily uh i think we sort of take it for granted or or saying
*  what is prior cortex doing we've had some of this in a clinical sense and you know broadman areas
*  etc um but yeah guys like mount castle just marching around saying
*  this is what i see uh it's a very cursory i know but there's something so nice about being able
*  to do that all right eric this has been weird and fantastic but we're not that weird no no no you
*  didn't make it weird it's just a you know i i'm about to say two things to you that i've never
*  said to a previous guest one i'll see you tomorrow and and two i'll bring the octopus
*  if if it's to eat don't i'm allergic uh please don't uh all right thanks for doing it's delicious
*  but uh yeah you twisted my arm and uh but this was a lot of fun and uh hopefully someone else
