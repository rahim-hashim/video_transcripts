# BI 182: John Krakauer Returns... Again
**Brain Inspired:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_QoSVyi7Fs)
*  I always am a bit baffled by people who deny either that there is such a thing as higher
*  cognition, which is, we can have a conversation about that, and then the people who want to
*  sort of concoct a sensory motor origin out of it.
*  There are many cherished ideas that continue to be used not because they are likely to
*  be what's really going on, but because they are very amenable to formalism.
*  The current craze in AI is large language models, which are entirely based on a human
*  product.
*  Right, so in other words, the irony is just delicious that suddenly here we are dealing
*  with human language.
*  This is Brain Inspired, I'm Paul.
*  If you listen to Brain Inspired regularly, my guest today needs no introduction.
*  So aside from his name, I won't.
*  John Krakauer has been on the podcast multiple times, and if you like our discussion today,
*  I do link to his previous episodes in the show notes at braininspired.co slash podcast
*  slash 182.
*  Today we discuss some topics framed around what he's been working on and thinking about
*  lately.
*  Things like whether brains actually reorganize after damage, the role of brain plasticity
*  in general, the path toward and the path not toward understanding higher cognition, how
*  to fix motor problems after strokes, artificial general intelligence, how next time we should
*  both agree that we're going to record our conversation for a podcast and plenty more.
*  And if you're a Patreon supporter, you get 30 extra minutes wherein we discuss my own
*  current research project.
*  And John lends his thoughts to that.
*  Bolshoi spasiba, Patreon supporters.
*  It's a little rusty Russian there.
*  I apologize.
*  Here's John.
*  So this is a fun way to realize that you did not know that we were going to be recording
*  a podcast episode today because I said, hey, I'm about to hit record.
*  But before I do, I was going to ask you something else.
*  And you said, oh, I didn't know we were doing that.
*  Welcome, friend of the show, John Krakauer.
*  Hello.
*  How are you?
*  Happy New Year.
*  Happy New Year to you.
*  Yes, this is some I can tell this is going to be a harbinger of 2024 being full of surprises.
*  Yeah, we were we were kind of just shooting the shit there for a while.
*  And I thought, gosh, we should get recording pretty soon here.
*  And then I surprised you by saying, hey, that's what we're doing.
*  It's always a mistake when you think somebody is your friend.
*  Oh, come on.
*  I was about to ask you something very personal, which I'm now not going to ask you, at least
*  in the recorded version.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  But so we had gone back and forth a little bit, kind of teased each other back and forth
*  a little bit about you coming on again.
*  And I thought this would be a good time specifically with a list of grievances.
*  And I thought that's sort of a euphemism for just topics that you might want to discuss.
*  But I thought the 2024 this could be an annual list of grievances by John Krakauer sort of
*  a recurring episode.
*  Oh, my gosh, I kind of like that.
*  So we were catching up on how you're globetrotting and starting some programs, running some other
*  programs, designing a warehouse.
*  There's an interior designer in your actual house right now.
*  And we chatted the other day and you were telling me I'm not sure what you want to chat
*  about, but you were telling me about a new manuscript that you're working on that you're
*  excited about.
*  So really, the floor is kind of open to discuss whatever we want to discuss.
*  And actually, I would like to pick your brain because I'm back in academia and I'm swimming
*  in a sea with lots of old pieces of wood that seem like they're floating.
*  When I grab onto them, they start sinking down and don't hold me up, that sort of thing.
*  So if we get to them.
*  I mean, I've also thought about you.
*  It must be given what your journey with the podcast and all the perspectives and all the
*  reading and all the thinking you've been doing.
*  It must be quite interesting to get back in the lab, get back in the lab.
*  You know, it is like going to college again, you know, when you're much older, right?
*  What is that line?
*  Oh, if only I'd known the things I know now when I was younger.
*  Right.
*  So in other words, you're getting another go around.
*  It must be sort of to hear your view on how different does it feel doing neuroscience
*  this time around?
*  That's interesting.
*  I am the oldest person in the lab.
*  I'm the old man.
*  Another interesting thing about going back into the lab is that I'm sort of like known
*  in that community, you know, and that's an odd thing.
*  In fact, Eric told me that I was the most bashful celebrity he'd ever met, which I
*  thought was an odd thing to say, you know, but especially because I'm not a celebrity.
*  Yes, you are.
*  Actually, yes, you are.
*  And very narrow.
*  You are.
*  You are.
*  Not at all.
*  You occupy a very important place in the ecosystem.
*  Yeah.
*  And now I'm trying to maintain that occupation as well as doing real science.
*  And so maybe we'll get to that later.
*  Well, I would simply, you know, just if I may just object to that.
*  You know, I think I talked to you once way back about, you know, Hasok Chang's sort of
*  definition of philosophy of science, which he thought was complementary science.
*  And I think that you are doing real science, having the conversations you're having and
*  playing the role that you're playing.
*  And I mean that sincerely.
*  It is not true in my view to call, you know, oh, generally, you know, gathering data in
*  the lab is real science and having the discussions that I've had.
*  They're both complementary forms of science.
*  That's what I would say.
*  And when you, when, when everything is sort of in the dust settles, I think it'd be very
*  interesting to see where the greater percentage of the variance of your influence has been.
*  Oh, I can guarantee you the greater percentage has been through the podcast.
*  I mean, that's not even a question, but that's as much of a knock on my own
*  lab science.
*  Again, I just, I know that I know that's the way that people think, but I do.
*  I actually think it's non pluralistic to take that view, but you know me about that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yep.
*  So, so what is new with you?
*  What, what do you want to chat about before we go down the rabbit hole of my own problems?
*  Well, I mean, as I was sort of saying to you off, you know, off the recording, you know,
*  I, my interests at the moment, what I'm sort of doing is sort of sharing Tonian sort of
*  physiology and psychophysics.
*  Looking at the phenotype of hemiparesis, it's really amazing, right?
*  That stroke is that gives you the most common motor disorder and, you know, you can make
*  smooth reaching movements and prehension and we all do it.
*  We're doing it now with our coffee cups.
*  And yet if you broke that system, I don't think any of us would guess how it would fall
*  apart into the bits of abnormal features that you see, right?
*  You get weak and you lose dexterity and you have spasticity and you have synergies and.
*  You know, it's just very strange to try and guess how the same system has been assembled
*  by looking at the way it falls apart like Humpty Dumpty after damage.
*  And so I've, I'm finding it really interesting to sort of try and dissect the behavioral
*  phenotype better and better and then try and map that onto physiology and anatomy.
*  So you would laugh, I think, poor very mechanistic, sharing Tonian, you know, hardcore
*  project. And yet that's exactly what it is.
*  And I'm very lucky to have people, younger people who have grants now with me and with
*  others also working on this, you know, wonderful young scientist in Harvard, David Lin,
*  who has a grant working on this, someone called Ahmed Araq, who's doing 3D reaching
*  studies, you know, markless tracking on the phenotype with us.
*  A former postdoc of mine is now chair of the College of Science in Israel doing it.
*  So in other words, there's a real, I think, interest in trying to do old school, mid
*  20th century behavior and physiology on an old problem with new tools.
*  And I'm finding that very exciting and very interesting.
*  When you say sharing Tonian, let's just make sure that people know what you're
*  talking about. You're talking about Chuck Sherrington.
*  But when you say sharing Tonian, you mean kind of a circuit based approach.
*  Area X connects to area Y.
*  What happens? And then in your case, sometimes you're lesioning, creating a stroke and
*  or studying strokes in humans, right?
*  Well, actually, yes.
*  In other words, they're obviously not lesioning them on purpose.
*  But you know, with a really fabulous primate physiologist, Stuart Baker, in the UK, we
*  have a grant where we're trying to create a new model of hemiparesis, you know, going
*  beyond the classic Kuypers and Sarah Tower papers from the mid 20th century and
*  where mainly they were making pyramidal lesions and they were not seeing some of the
*  features that are very prominent in humans.
*  So this is sort of a mystery as why even as our closest relatives not showing the full
*  panoply of abnormalities.
*  And in fact, it made it be interesting to listeners that the term extra pyramidal,
*  which is what people use now to talk about movement disorders in neurology, came from
*  the fact that you couldn't see the positive symptoms in the pyramidal lesion monkeys.
*  They didn't have spasticity.
*  They didn't have synergies.
*  They were just weak and lost dexterity.
*  So it led you to obey.
*  Well, where are those things?
*  They must be extra pyramidal.
*  I see. Right.
*  And the neologism.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  It came from being puzzled by the absence of the movement disorder in the stroke model
*  in the monkey.
*  And so we're trying to address that mystery.
*  And it also leads to a real rethink about the cortical spinal tract and how utterly
*  dependent humans became on it.
*  And the way I like to talk about it is the cortical spinal tract, which is the tract
*  that is the cause of hemiparesis after stroke when it's lesioned.
*  It's not just a control of muscles.
*  It's a control of all the other controllers.
*  So the disassembly that you see is a manifestation of its loss of control over many, many,
*  many centers along the axis, the neural axis.
*  Right.
*  And so, yeah.
*  Are the varieties of those phenomena, the behavioral phenomena, are those varieties
*  perplexing or are they systematic?
*  Because, you know, what you've seen is like given a stroke.
*  It's interesting to see the varieties, right, of different behavioral outcomes.
*  Well, I mean, it's a bit of both, right?
*  On the one hand, you see these features over and over again, and yet they are weighted
*  differently and they appear at different times after the lesion.
*  So you've got a mixture of...
*  It looks like the underlying equation, if you could only find it, is the same, but the
*  weights on the parameters are different.
*  And then, of course, in terms of all the potential ways that you could do it, the null
*  space of potential connections, in other words, is it something about the brain stem?
*  Is it something about the spinal cord?
*  Is it something about the connection between the brain, the brain stem and the spinal
*  cord?
*  In other words, there are many either or possibilities that you can entertain in terms
*  of connectivity and strength of connections.
*  And you're just going to have to find out.
*  So in other words, you're absolutely right.
*  It is about very much about what's connected to what and what's the strength of the
*  connection and what's upregulated.
*  And it's painstaking.
*  And of course, we don't in humans have good ways yet to image the brain stem and the
*  spinal cord. So that's why people have been looking under the light for so long with
*  non-invasive methods cortically.
*  So, yeah, it's a very...
*  But it's a huge undertaking, Paul, right?
*  It's basically a decades long project to better characterize the behavioral abnormality,
*  begin to get a better insight into what its generative mechanisms are.
*  It's really old fashioned, cool neuroscience.
*  But this...
*  So, I mean, you started this off by saying that I might be surprised to hear that you're
*  involved in this kind of a mechanistic approach, because a lot of what we talked about
*  in the past has been...
*  I mean, you have an interest in higher cognition, right?
*  And thinking, you know, in terms, at least in terms of higher cognition, and you can
*  correct me if I'm speaking for you here, that that kind of circuit, A, goes to node
*  B, goes to node C, that kind of thinking, that sharingtonian approach is not going to
*  get us to understanding higher cognition, whereas what you're doing right now is a much
*  more mechanistic circuit based approach.
*  So, but you've been interested in movement and behavior itself also for a long time.
*  So it's not like you're just interested in higher cognition.
*  So it doesn't surprise me that much.
*  Right. I mean, and also, I think, you know, when we first spoke, I mean, I always think
*  that the trying to understand things versus trying to fix things are quite different
*  projects. Now, this is one where the...
*  There's a better subterranean connection between understanding the abnormality versus
*  trying to fix it. In other words, trying to understand a healthy system versus trying
*  to understand how an unhealthy system works versus fixing how that unhealthy system
*  works is along a spectrum. And so, yes, and, you know, the projects at your own university
*  right now, Pittsburgh, I mean, it's extremely exciting given this notion of the cortical
*  spinal tract being the one ring that rules them all. And if you could bring the cortical
*  spinal tract back online with all its potential targets, you could actually hit all the features
*  at once of the hemiparesis phenotype. We're trying to implant electrodes in the cervical
*  cord, you know, this is work led by Marco Capogrosso and Alvira Perandini and others,
*  and amplify the residual signal of the descending commands so that they can do their job better.
*  So, in other words, it's very exciting. In other words, we had a paper early in 2023,
*  two patients showing that you could get quite remarkable return of function as soon as you
*  turn the stimulators on, showing that there was this residual capacity in the descending
*  system to do better than it was doing with the patient on their own. So, there's a very
*  exciting, I would say, confluence.
*  Yeah, sorry, does it require that there be some remaining activity that it's, I mean,
*  it's not completely...
*  Yes, I mean, I think so. In other words, but it's interesting, right? I mean, even it's
*  the same as in spinal cord injury. When people say you have a total spinal cord injury, it's
*  never really total in most cases. There's some residual descending. Now, what you can
*  do with that... But yes, in other words, you're assuming that you've got residual capacity
*  that you have to try and kick start and bring back online. So, and then you have to mix
*  that with behavior. In other words, this is what's so interesting to me is with the work
*  with video gaming is you want to create the ideal behavioral platform against which you
*  try and bring circuits online. So, it's sort of like a double hit. Bring it online physiologically
*  and then sculpt it behaviorally and do that simultaneously. And so, it's a very interesting...
*  I mean, that's sort of where I'm at in terms of a monkey model, physiology, you know, better
*  dissection, especially in 3D of the abnormality, using 3D robotics and motion capture, and
*  then trying to in fact do non-invasive imaging, TMS, and just try and get a sense of this
*  whole thing. So, yeah, that's something that I'm heavily involved in and find very enjoyable
*  because it covers all the things that I like, like you said. It's patience, it's recovery,
*  it's physiology, it's behavior. It's not higher cognition. No, no, absolutely not. I mean,
*  I would say like you asked me once way back, it's because I've studied the motor system
*  so much and seen patients with high cognitive deficits and been very interested in the cognitive
*  motor interface, which is a title I often give my talks because I'm very interested
*  in planning problems, apraxia. I'm very much interested. Some people have even called them
*  like Scott Grafton, the higher motor disorders, right? And, you know, in my book back in 2017,
*  I actually quote Sherrington's 1917 paper, a big paragraph where he and his colleagues,
*  Layton and Sherrington, comment on the separation between the consternation and thinking that
*  the chimpanzee was doing versus its surprise that its arm wasn't working. So it's a very
*  beautiful passage where they literally point out the separation between, hey, WTF, why
*  can't this work? And keep sending a command down to get the arm to work. And, you know,
*  when you see that passage that goes back over a century, it's something that you see all
*  the time in patients is this complete surprise at their lower level deficits when they're
*  completely, you know, the most, most dramatic example of this, of course, is locked in syndrome
*  where, you know, the person has a basus pontus lesion. They can't move anything at all, right?
*  And yet they can dictate whole novels in their heads, right? In other words, I always am
*  a bit baffled by people who deny either that there is such a thing as higher cognition,
*  which is we can have a conversation about that. And then the people who want to sort
*  of concoct a sensory motor origin out of it, right? Yeah. That's sort of the 4E story in
*  some form or another. And I mean, I know I would love to be a motor chauvinist. I would
*  love to say that the work that we're doing on the sensory motor system is the core set
*  of principles that everything else will launch out of. But I just, I'm a bit of a no free
*  lunch theorem person. You're just not going to get everything out of one place. And we're
*  going to have to have a different story. Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree with that. But I'm not sure
*  that you would find that many people that disagreed with you, let's say, for example,
*  within the 4E community, the embodied inactive, the 4E community who... Oh my God. Well, are
*  you joking? Well, when it really comes down to it, because there are frameworks to understand,
*  right? So if you think of thinking as in terms of thinking can be thought of as internal
*  motion, right? I mean, if you go and you measure brain activity, it's not like you're actually
*  measuring neural activity related to movements that just happens on the inside, but it's
*  more of a framework for thinking about how thinking evolved, because you have to analogize
*  and model everything. Well, I mean, again, this is a lovely segue into something else
*  that I'm heavily involved with, which I think if you don't mind, I mean, let's move into
*  this, right? So in other words, Thomas Ryan, I don't know if you've ever had him on your
*  show. I think you have. I have. I just met him at SFN too. Yeah. So Thomas... Thomas.
*  Francis Fallon, a philosopher, Kevin Mitchell, Melanie Mitchell, Celeste Kidd, we're all
*  part of this, and I'm sure I've not listed everyone. I hope they don't listen to this
*  and think I've forgotten them, but their names will pop into my head in a minute. I have
*  a part of something called... It's a representational working group at Trinity College Dublin where
*  we're working on the issue of representation in neuroscience. In fact, we launched... We
*  have an article that explains our project in the new magazine called The Transmitter
*  released by the Simons Foundation where we wrote about this project. And the reason I'm
*  bringing this up, other than it being just what I'm a major part of, is one of the things
*  that the 4E people are denying when they get interesting, in other words, it's a fight
*  worth having, is that they're anti-representationalist. In other words, the real issue when it comes
*  to cognition, where the fight has happened for decades and decades, is representation,
*  language of thought, symbols. That is something that the 4E, and I'm just going to say this
*  broadly, deny completely.
*  Okay. As long as the caveat is that you're saying it broadly.
*  Sure. But I mean, you can always do the Mark Bailey thing, which is to go, oh, well, this
*  is the overall position, which is anti-representationalist, is sensorimotor. And then, so, oh, well,
*  there are some that will make some little qualification to squirl out of being too extreme.
*  I think that there are papers I've seen just in the last week that want to take the sort
*  of Gibsonian affordance, non-representationalist, embedded. I mean, it rears its head in all
*  sorts of ways, and it's basically anti-cognitivist. And to go back to the beginning of what I
*  was saying is you're just not going to get to those phenomena from the sensorimotor system.
*  And just another point here, there are two kind of strains, right? There are the neuroscientists
*  who want to sort of tell a biology of cognition. They want to get away from a psychology of
*  cognition. Even when you had Max Bennett on your show, there was, oh, well, those are
*  psychological terms, right? So in other words, there's this idea that we've got to get away
*  from a psychology of cognition, and we need a biology of cognition, you know, basal cognition,
*  you know, things like what Mike Levin is doing, Pamela Lyons, that strain, that surely that
*  we can get some sort of life principle, some Fristonian cellular principle. So let's go
*  to biology and life, let's not go to psychology. And then you've got, they go even further,
*  you know, like Carl is that they think they might be a physics of cognition. In other
*  words, you know, when you listen to Carl, he's really trying to be a physicist of cognition
*  and agency. And then, you know, in the light of that sort of basic biology, basic physics
*  of cognition, the inactivists, the embodied people are quite non-revolutionary. They're
*  at least trying to be sensorimotor physiological. And then you've got people like me, old fashioned
*  people like me going that we need to go, we do need a psychology and a cognitive science
*  that isn't sensorimotor, isn't cellular biology and isn't physics. Do you see what I'm saying?
*  So in other words, you can see this massive effort to go down to basic principles, to
*  that allow you to get away from the human centric psychological view of cognition. And
*  that's where we're at. And of course, the deep irony of it, the final point, the deep
*  hilarious irony of it is the current craze in AI is large language models, which are
*  entirely based on a human product. Right? So in other words, the irony is just delicious
*  that after all this attempt to be ecumenical and talk about intelligence in animals and
*  go down to other basic systems and be more sensorimotor, and then suddenly here we are
*  dealing with human language. Right? It's just so deliciously ironic that this is where we've
*  reached.
*  That the cutting edge of AI right now is based on products of human cognition. Is that what
*  you're saying?
*  I'm saying that it just turns out that the most impressive feats of claims to AGI are
*  a system that parasitizes, does archeology on vast quantities of human thought in the
*  form of language. So in other words, I'm just saying that the embedded story about intelligence
*  in an amoeba or in a worm, it's irrelevant. Right? In other words,
*  That's interesting to me that you would say that because I know at the same time you are
*  a quote unquote pluralist, right? So any sort of scientific questions should be approached
*  from different angles and different levels. And they're all valid. Some of them may be
*  more valid than others. So in that sense, you might need a basal cognition slash life
*  story. You might need also the psychology story. But the way that you're saying it right
*  now is like one of those is the winner, which is confusing to someone like me.
*  No, I'm saying that don't claim pluralism in the guise of reductionism. I'm saying
*  that what they're trying to do is to say if we can find some core set of things that
*  we're allowed to call cognitive and we can generate principles from those, then the rest
*  is just a kind of extrapolation from those principles. In other words, the actual heavy
*  lifting conceptually has been done at the basal level and the rest is just details.
*  It's like footnotes to Plato. It's footnotes to the intelligent. So we're going to go from
*  footnotes to Plato to footnotes to Fristan. Do you see? It's that kind of idea. And I
*  find that completely nonsensical. And it's actually very interesting even with people
*  on your show. And I told you about, I listened to your show with Max Bennett. I really enjoyed
*  it. I think he's made an amazing act of synthesis. But it's fascinating when you listen to that
*  podcast how often human psychological notions infect the discussion of the animal work.
*  There's this notion, I don't remember where it came from, of where surplus meaning leaks
*  into things. And so what happens, and my brother has talked about this, the difference between
*  models and metaphors where you don't realize that you've slipped from a model of something
*  to making it a metaphor for what you really care about. And so what you find is that psychological
*  cognitive terms keep slipping in as metaphors to the discussion. I heard it over and over
*  again, oh, the animal imagines whether it's going to go left or right. You hear that all
*  the time. There's nothing, nothing in the data that support that idea.
*  So how, in that particular case, what would be a better way to use that? So vicarious
*  trial and error was one way.
*  Vicarious trial, that's a real problem. But even there, that's not proven.
*  No, I know. But that's what I'm saying. You have to use words to describe it.
*  I'm just saying, well, you could just say, I mean, it's really interesting. I'm very
*  close friends with David Foster, who's done some of the most interesting work on this.
*  And I was with him in Portugal, and we had long debates about this. And in fact, one
*  of the pieces that I'm writing with Dan McNamee, a computational neuroscientist, is to say
*  that because they have neural evidence for latent structure in a maze and therefore can
*  generate a policy, that's interesting. However, it's a step too far to then infer that they're
*  entertaining options before they go. In other words, that is a beautiful example of the
*  metaphor of psychology. Oh, I'm imagining options. I'm looking at one and then the other,
*  and I'm choosing. That is not the obvious and only conclusion to the data. So what I'm
*  saying is, is that unless people are extremely careful, they're not going to be able to
*  do it. Right? But you can't be that careful. You find... What was that? I think it's a
*  challenge to be that careful in humans. No, because in humans... I absolutely disagree.
*  What I call this is the cusp, is that it's extremely challenging to do experiments in
*  animals where there isn't an alternative implicit algorithmic solution to what's going on without
*  having to invoke overt imagination. Okay? And that's something that we're writing about,
*  gets to the whole notion of internal models, the whole notion of simulation, the whole
*  notion of imagination. And what I've argued in other pieces that I've written, when I
*  wrote the review of Nick Shays book on representation and cognition, is this very interesting, interesting
*  invoking of overt representation, imagination, simulation, when you don't need to. Right?
*  Right there. But in humans, to your point, in humans, you can do it in a second. You
*  can come up with an experiment where it's simply impossible to explain the performance
*  of the person without invoking overt representation. You know, I've told you before on this show
*  and definitely on the learning salon with Ida, you know, close your eyes, imagine you're
*  standing in front of your house and walk through your home. Now, there's just no other way
*  to explain what you're doing other than the fact that you're overtly conjuring up your
*  house and thinking about the paintings on the walls and the turnstiles. Now, what I'm
*  saying is that there isn't a shred of evidence yet that any other animal species can do that.
*  Because we do it all the time, you walk by a furniture store, you see a couch, you go,
*  ugh, I love that couch, but it's too big for my living room. Right? You just know that
*  it's too big for your living room. You have a sense of the dimensions of your living room,
*  you have a sense of the dimensions of the couch, you do some kind of thinking in your
*  head that it's just not going to fit. We do it over and over and over again. Right? Now,
*  the interesting thing is, is that a lot of the time, even us humans don't, right? Whenever
*  I'm in a hotel and I take the elevator to my floor and I take the twists and turns to
*  my room, I'm certainly not imagining the hotel corridor or where my door is right to the
*  others. I'm just doing something much more mouse-like. I remember through more, I remember
*  a few landmarks. I remember that fire extinguisher. I remember that. And I basically don't have
*  to rise to the occasion of overtly representing anything. Right? And I find my way each time.
*  So yes, you're right. Human beings also are mouse-like a lot of the time. But we have
*  this superpower. But we have this superpower. We can do imagination. We can do time travel.
*  I'm going to go back to Pittsburgh and do science. I'm going to not do it this year
*  because I still have my podcast. But I think I'm going to do it next year when for these
*  reasons I can imagine it would be more feasible. That is a very different kettle of fish to
*  finding a hotel room through landmarks when you get out of an elevator. And we just don't
*  know how to do it. We don't know how that works. And all I'm saying is, let's just accept
*  that doing an amoeba in a dish, a paramecium, a worm, or looking at a large language model
*  and Ida Momenichar has done some beautiful work testing them at their navigation abilities
*  and they suck. Right? And just accept, as David Deutsch has also said, there's something
*  interesting about human beings and their ability to explain the universe and imagine it. And
*  I'm just saying that at the moment there's no contender to explain that ability. And
*  trying to explain it away through physics, basal cognition, or AI, is just a premature
*  hubris in my view. So do you think, this is just now I'm just baiting you, but there's
*  something exceptional about humans, right? You know, do you think in terms, less in terms
*  of a continuum among the different species in the known world? Or is there some sort
*  of human exceptionalism?
*  Well, I mean, you know, John Maynard Smith, you know, and forgetting the co-author, wrote
*  a book about, you know, transitions in evolution. I don't think anyone in linguistics denies
*  that human language is singular and does not exist on a continuum with communication. And
*  in fact, many people even deny, you know, even if you talk to like, you know, my friend
*  Paul Cizek, he'll go, well, language abstraction, yes, but let's table that for now, right?
*  So in other words, language is the one place where people will allow exceptionalism, but
*  it's the one place and everything else is on a continuum. It's hilarious. And yet when
*  you actually look at the requisites, you know, beautiful work by Ev Fedorenko and her team
*  showing that, you know, language and thought are quite distinct, and also showing that
*  without the thought bit, you can't use the language bit, right? So and you look at, you
*  know, Tom Scott Phillips and his work, you know, showing that really there's a unique
*  form of inference, ostensive inference that you need in order to use language. And language
*  is proof of a unique cognitive ability, not conferring a unique cognitive ability. But
*  the thing is, again, a lot of people aren't even familiar with this work, right? That's
*  one of the reasons why I want to set up this program with Melanie Mitchell, if we can,
*  at SFI is to just have more conversations between people who really do look at primate
*  cognition, who really do look at, you know, COVID cognition and really see what they do
*  and cannot do, rather than just vaguely invoking them as proof of a continuum, right? Let's
*  just get into it. I think most people just don't get into it.
*  Yeah. Total aside, but how is it? It just struck me that you have a boss in your younger
*  brother, sometimes. How's that?
*  Yes. Yes. Well, I mean, you know, David and I have converged a lot in terms of our interest.
*  And I think David, you know, lives in this oscillation on this topic of intelligence,
*  where he's absolutely not human-centric. And I think he does differ to me from the sort
*  of cognitive science psychology. He does believe very much that there should be general principles.
*  But he also agrees very much with emergence. He very much believes that you can have discontinuities
*  and, you know, an emergence has two meanings, right? One is sort of these new properties
*  from an aggregate, but it's also what sort of explanatory framework is needed, and do
*  you need to go under the hood, as he says. So I think there's a very interesting tension
*  which he enjoys between looking for general principles across the continuum, but also
*  recognizing in emergencies there are discontinuities, right? And the question is, and the point
*  that he always makes, which is very interesting, is that we do not know ahead of time when
*  we should and when we should not look under the hood, when there is a continuity and when
*  there isn't a continuity. There is no general principle of recognizing a system as being
*  one or the other ahead of time, right? So the example he always gives is, you know,
*  to understand the boiling point of water, you need to know about the molecular structure
*  of water. For fluid dynamics, the Navier-Stokes, you don't, right? And so it's an open question,
*  and he will admit to me, I think, I don't think I'm putting words in his mouth, that
*  he says it may well be true that there are discontinuities somewhere between chimpanzees
*  five, six million years ago and all the hominid species in between, which we don't have access
*  to, and us, that a discontinuity occurred. And as, you know, I mention all the time,
*  don't confuse substrate continuity with functional discontinuity, right? The example that Tom
*  Scott Phillips always gives is feathers, right? Feathers for flight and feathers for
*  thermoregulation look the same, right? But there's no continuity between flight and
*  thermoregulation. Those are completely discontinuous functions for a substrate that is completely
*  continuous, feather structure. Right, so that's another big problem I think that people in
*  biology and neuroscience make, is that they think that substrate continuity implies functional
*  continuity. It does not. Do you think the recent handful of years discovering new intelligences
*  in different species, like crow tool use, etc., you know, the more that we learn about
*  a given species, you know, slime mold can solve a maze, and what does that mean? I mean,
*  just zooming out, it sure looks continuous, even function-wise. It doesn't look discontinuous,
*  to me. I don't think so. In other words, you know, I think that the great success of reinforcement
*  learning in the biological world has been model-free, right? There are many, many model-free
*  ways to engage in intelligent behavior. In computer science, there's an entire model-based
*  approach to RL. The problem has been to try and fuse the model-based approach in computer
*  science and look for its analogs in the animal world, and that's why I think it's been a
*  failure. It's a false friend. Because it doesn't exist in the animal world? Doesn't exist.
*  I don't think it exists, no. So, they keep trying to find it, and then what you find
*  are sort of clever, model-free, kludges that get the job done, you know. Successor representation,
*  things like that, and others. So, I think that, and you know, the example I'm giving
*  and I'm writing right now is in this long-term book, but you know, is take an alien watching
*  someone playing Pac-Man, and you were looking at a Pac-Man game and there was the human
*  playing Ms. Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and the computer was the ghosts, and the ghosts were
*  chasing after Ms. Pac-Man, and at times Ms. Pac-Man chases after the ghosts, and you were
*  watching as an alien, you'd be quite correct to say, look, there's agency in the ghosts,
*  and there's agency in Ms. Pac-Man, and they're both intelligent. They're goal-directed, get
*  the ghosts and the little dots or whatever they're called. But the fact is, and the point
*  I'm making is there isn't a remote algorithmic overlap between the way the human is playing
*  it and the way the computer is. So, it's not a continuum, it's a discontinuity that looks
*  like it's showing you that the task can be solved in two completely different ways, right?
*  But just to come to the premature conclusion, because to me it looks like they're both running
*  and chasing and eating, that they're therefore doing it the same way, is idiocy.
*  Could you say that, so then just sticking with this species, right, is there humans
*  and everything else, or are there discontinuities between species as well?
*  I'm sure there are discontinuities between species too.
*  Large ones between plants and animals perhaps?
*  Yeah, absolutely. And you know, Tomasello has written a book recently, came out I think
*  last year, talking about these transitions. Very much the sort of story that Max gave.
*  The hierarchical control book, Tomasello?
*  Yeah, very much, yes. Very much this, the evolution of agency, I think it's called,
*  I think that's right.
*  Right, but basically everyone's telling this step story. You know, it's kind of ironic,
*  right, is that everyone picks their own discontinuities and then try nevertheless to tell a continuous
*  story. Well, oh well, yes, there are these new functional capacities, but it's on a continuum.
*  So, how are you doing that? How are you managing to have your cake and eat it, right? So, I
*  think yes, I mean I think that, but you know, humans are a kind of metastatic cognition,
*  they're kind of a cancer cognition. You know, they did something that is going to destroy
*  the planet. So, you could argue that human cognition is a step too far. It is some horrible
*  discontinuity just like cancer is a discontinuity from normal cell division.
*  That's such a pessimistic viewpoint.
*  Well, I mean look what we're doing. I mean, you know, we are the only species that will
*  probably engineer our own extinction.
*  Well, that's the pessimistic part because I understand that. Like, look at the global
*  warming data, right, and it's hard to argue against that except that on like longer time
*  scales, looking back, let's say we advance far enough, quickly enough that we can solve
*  the problem, right? So, we're eating ourselves out of our own houses, but we need to eat
*  that food to be able to think how to build a new house, you know, as a bad analogy. And
*  there's that potential race going on, right? Are we smart enough to barely see ourselves?
*  Yeah, but what you're saying basically is...
*  I think it's hubris to think that we're smart enough to destroy ourselves. I mean, I understand
*  that we are because we could...
*  I could say that I could argue back that it's hubris to believe that we're smart enough
*  to save ourselves, but you know...
*  Well, yeah.
*  I mean, but all I'm saying is that if you were to take a look at the Earth from space...
*  I mean, David Deutsch has a great example of this, right? I mean, David Deutsch gives
*  an amazing example which made me laugh. He said, in every other planet, if an asteroid
*  is coming towards it, the laws of physics will mean that it will be attracted and will
*  collide like it did with the great extinction, right? But if you were watching Earth and
*  humans found a way to repel an asteroid, you would be seeing one little planet with a superpower
*  that defied the laws of physics where an asteroid actually didn't collide with the Earth. And
*  the point that David Deutsch makes, which is so clever, he says, that's human understanding
*  acting as a force opposite to physics.
*  And understanding in terms of control in that respect.
*  That's right. There is an ability on that planet that understands the universe, and
*  there is a force counter to physics forces called understanding. And it's so brilliant,
*  the idea, because he's absolutely right that you actually see a causal consequence of understanding
*  that only humans have, is that the asteroid doesn't hit the planet. It's so clever.
*  It's a great idea.
*  It's not an analysis. It's basically not an analysis. It's actually true.
*  It's an understanding, yeah.
*  So in other words, you're seeing another force in the universe repelling an asteroid. And
*  it's understanding. And all I'm saying is that is amazing. And he's right. And he also
*  agrees that there's this ability to understand and explain features in the universe and therefore
*  have a causal effect on them. And that's fascinating. But studying a C. elegans isn't going to tell
*  you how that happens.
*  Right. But the irony is we deflect the asteroid and then the following week we all die because
*  we've killed ourselves.
*  Yeah, no, exactly. Exactly. In other words, all I'm saying is, is that there's something
*  unstable like cancer about this form of cognition that evolved with the same substrate. And
*  it's just very difficult to know how to get attraction on it, to explain it. In other
*  words, and you could say, and I'm sure you will, oh, so here we are now with cognition
*  that can repel asteroids. Surely we can use this cognition to understand cognition itself.
*  Perhaps we will.
*  Perhaps we won't.
*  Or perhaps we won't. But I'd rather we accepted the size of the thing that we need to explain
*  rather than, as we've been discussing, these bizarre attempts to diminish it, explain it
*  away, deny it. That is what I find very, very strange.
*  It's perhaps because we try to, and maybe this is the reductionist approach, and we
*  can move on in just a second, but maybe it's because we do understand everything else as
*  reflections of what we think about ourselves, right? Because everything else is below us,
*  quote unquote. And so a simpler version, right? And so if we're this complex version, then
*  we have a high probability of explaining everything else in our own terms that we've invented
*  through language and psychology, et cetera.
*  Sure. Yes. I mean, I...
*  At one point, using that language, and it's this notion of surplus, at some point in your
*  podcast with Max...
*  It's a recency effect.
*  Well, yeah, well, no, but it is a recency effect. But I think it's actually important
*  because there is a link between the conversations in a way, right? The notion of intelligence,
*  AI. And this idea, oh, well, it's the same template, I think, at one point is said, but
*  then more complicated things are done with it. So in other words, all the weight of the
*  extra is in the term more complicated, more sophisticated.
*  Oh.
*  Right? So in other words, you go, I don't know what I'm jamming into that word. It's
*  basically this, but a little bit more complicated. But this is where language just makes you
*  get out of jail free, which is just to... You've actually not said anything very interesting
*  by saying it's the same thing, basically a bit more complicated. Now you've put all
*  the explanatory weight on the word complicated, and then you go, well, tell me exactly what
*  that means, more complicated. Is a computer just a more complicated calculator? Right?
*  Is a plane just a more complicated car? Right? You can get away with everything with squirrely
*  words like that. Do you see?
*  Okay.
*  And yet it's very, very hypnotically sort of comforting to be able to do that.
*  Explain away via complication?
*  Yeah. Words like that. Right? It's the same, but it's just a bit more complex, a bit more
*  complicated. Right? And maybe it's just my problem, but I just don't find that very satisfying.
*  Sure. Yeah. I still, I mean, there's... I'm not sure that we're ever going to be able
*  to explain ourselves via ourselves. Maybe we need aliens to actually help us do that.
*  Right? Tell us.
*  Again, I mean, in philosophy, there's this notion of reference fixing, you know, and
*  David Barak really, you know, taught me about that and brought my attention to it, which
*  is let's at least agree that there's a problem in need of explanation and not do that thing,
*  which is very sort of Freudian. Ah, you know, you don't like psychoanalysis because you
*  have a problem. Right? And just say, look, just because we're recognizing a phenomenon
*  doesn't mean that we've already decided on a theory for that phenomenon. And I sometimes
*  feel that when it comes to cognition, you're not even allowed to say that it's a thing
*  in need of explanation because people will accuse you in invoking it. You already are
*  committed to a theoretical framework and therefore you're not worth arguing with. Now I find
*  that that's simply in all seriousness, I find strange. I think there is something in need
*  of explanation. We can be ecumenical and pluralistic about trying to understand it, but don't just
*  deny that invoking it is already a theoretical misstep. I don't understand that move and
*  it could well be that I will turn out to be wrong, but I just, I don't think that's a
*  very healthy starting point, which is to go, oh, what is cognition? What is thinking? You
*  know, what is intelligence? You know, you're just, you know, concocting terms that are
*  getting you into trouble. It's like the ether. I don't think cognition is the ether. I don't
*  know what you think, but I don't think that's right.
*  What do you mean? Can you expound on that a little bit before I agree or disagree?
*  Well you know, people in physics invoked an ether, right, to explain the propagation of
*  light.
*  That is not real. Okay.
*  And it was just, and it was a completely non-existent entity, right? It's like phrygistim.
*  I think it depends on how you define it because there is an ether if you define it the right
*  way.
*  Well, I don't think so. I think things like phrygistim and ether don't exist and I think
*  that, you know, just like a life force, vitalism, there are many things that invoked entities
*  that just don't need to be invoked. They basically can be discarded and I don't think that the
*  notion of thinking and cognition can be like that, that you can just tell a more pragmatic,
*  embedded, sensory motor story. You can go back to more basic principles and you don't
*  have to invoke anything extra. It's a little similar to, you know, if we want to we can
*  move on to sort of this recent work we've done about there not being anything like cortical
*  reorganization.
*  Yeah. Let's move on to that because, so to wrap up, so I feel an affinity and a soft
*  spot for that 4E approach and I think because it is grounded in things that I feel I understand
*  better than things like quote unquote higher cognition, ether or not, and I appreciate
*  it from a pluralistic perspective, right? And I also appreciate the physics of life
*  and approach and the biology of intelligence is I think what you refer to it as. And it's
*  I don't see...
*  And please don't get me wrong, I mean, so do I. I mean, I think that work is fantastic.
*  I mean, I think biology is amazing. All I'm saying is there are three ways to look at
*  it just to finish. There's the biology of the system which deserves to be studied on
*  its own grounds because it's amazing, right? The incredible work that people like Levin
*  are doing. I mean, just incredibly interesting experiments, right? And all the people doing
*  amazing work on animal intelligence. I mean, it's just glorious science, right? And it
*  shows you all the different ways that you can have the algorithms that biology has come
*  up with to do intelligent behavior, right? Of course. The question is, is when do those
*  become models for something else? When is one animal a model for another? And I'm just
*  saying that people like Michael Katz and others have argued very beautifully that we don't
*  think strongly enough about what we're talking about from an evolutionary standpoint when
*  we claim that one animal is a model for another. Okay? And I don't think there's anywhere near
*  enough actual overt discussion about why you're allowed to claim that this animal is a model
*  for another. And you know, and I think that it's a bit strange to see a mouse as an intelligent
*  creature in its own right versus just seeing it as a little stepping stone towards primates,
*  right? And there's slippage between those two ways of seeing the mouse. And then finally,
*  third, it's the metaphor problem. In other words, you go from the animal in its own right
*  being intelligent, fascinating, claiming it's a model, whatever that means, and then the
*  worst is when you don't even, it's not even a model, it becomes a metaphor where you start
*  saying, oh, the mouse is imagining this, imagining that, right? And so I am not in any way critiquing
*  all the different ways that science is being done on intelligence. What I'm worried about
*  is when conceptual slippage occurs and people aren't even aware that it's happening.
*  So do you see what I mean? There is absolutely, the last thing I want to do is come across
*  and go, right, in the court of research, this should be allowed and this shouldn't. I mean,
*  that is absolute disaster to do that. So I don't want it to come across there. I'm just,
*  it's the conceptual slippage and the jumps that are made that are never overtly admitted
*  to.
*  Okay, fair enough. So we don't, different parts of our brain don't reorganize themselves
*  to take over different functions. Instead, those functions were always latent and available
*  and now get to be used.
*  That's right. Well, it's very interesting, you know. Yeah, I mean, so, you know, I have
*  an amazing colleague, she's a professor at Cambridge, Tamar Makin, and she's done, I
*  think, some of the most extraordinary sort of work looking at these phenomena of dramatic
*  plasticity in cases of, you know, disease or damage. You know, amputees, for example,
*  tool use. And, you know, I was doing work, as you know, on recovery of function in stroke
*  and there's been a lot of seminal work saying, oh, well, you know, when you lose this part
*  of the brain, an adjacent region takes over and, you know, Ramachandran seemed to have
*  a paper in Nature every couple of months showing some dramatic example of the brain's capacity
*  to reorganize. Whole books get written about the amazing plasticity of the human brain.
*  And, interestingly, classic experiments, whether it's McGunker-Sir's incredible ferret experiment
*  and Hubel and Weasel and on, and people sort of remember these experiments in a way that
*  actually isn't the way that they were reported or even the conclusions of the authors themselves.
*  Right? So, in other words, what Tamar and I did, coming from different areas, is that
*  we joined forces and spent almost three years just carefully going through these seminal
*  papers on reorganization. And, you know, I think that's the most interesting thing about
*  reorganization. And, you know, that, you know, the occipital cortex in the blind becomes
*  used for language, you know, and a hand area becomes a face area and all that kind of stuff.
*  That's the classic story. It's just not true. Right? And the thing is, is the term reorganization
*  is used to invoke something special. In other words, we don't usually say when I learned
*  how to play chess or I learned French or I learned table tennis. We don't usually say
*  in that case of health, oh, John's brain reorganized for table tennis or for French. So reorganization
*  is a term that's saved for the more dramatic instances where a limb is lost or a stroke
*  happens or you're congenitally blind or you've had a hemisphorectomy. It's almost as though
*  there needs to be a special form of plasticity to live up to the dramatic event itself and
*  the behavioral recovery itself. So the word reorganization-
*  You mean physical.
*  Yeah.
*  When you say it, you mean physical.
*  Reorganization, you know, what we said is that you are claiming that there's been a
*  qualitative change in the computation performed by a region. So it was doing function A before
*  and it was just co-opted and repurposed to do something else. And what we're saying
*  is it's simply not the case.
*  Doesn't necessarily have to be the case or is not the case?
*  It is not the case. In other words, if you look at the data, you know, it was an Occam's
*  razor kind of approach, then you can use preexisting notions of synaptic strengthening, you know,
*  synaptic binding, input agnostic computational ability. Let me give you an example of what
*  I mean, right? In other words, it would be very odd to say, you know, you're in a hotel
*  and you don't know the room and so you have to make sure that you don't stub your toe
*  on the bed and you use vision to navigate around the bed, okay? It's night and there's
*  been a power outage and now it's dark and so you can't see it. And you go, wait a minute,
*  I remember where the bed was in this room and I'm going to navigate around it with
*  memory instead of vision. But you're still using the same system to walk around the bed
*  so you basically have done a navigation computation using two different forms of input. It could
*  be memory input or it could be visual input. So there are many, many, many examples where
*  you can be sensory input agnostic to the computation you tend to want to do. So what I'm saying
*  is if you look through two basic lenses at the work that everyone thought needed the
*  invoking of reorganization, one is unmasking of latent ability that was always there and
*  up regulating it, combined with regions that are input agnostic in terms of the computations
*  they do, those two principles alone can explain all the dramatic results.
*  It can, but that doesn't mean that they necessarily do.
*  But I'm just saying that when you look at the actual data you don't see it. We go through
*  it and we're not just...
*  Yeah, you don't need to conclude.
*  Just be very clear. I'm just saying that we concluded that it was up regulation plus promiscuous
*  computational ability. That's what those results show. In other words, it's like the ether.
*  You can invoke some special thing where a region of the brain can simply have some generic
*  canonical Lego-like property where it can basically be reconfigured. But even the most
*  dramatic examples...
*  Yeah, that's what I was going to ask.
*  Were there compelling cases that would suggest reorganization?
*  Well, let's say that the most compelling one was the artificial one where McGunker-Cerny's
*  team took baby ferrets and rerouted lateral genetic nucleus output to A1 instead of B1.
*  Yeah, so that's LTE typically goes to visual cortex and if you reroute it, go ahead.
*  And basically they showed what looked like orientation-selective patches. But what they
*  actually tested behaviorally was just signal detection. And if you look at the actual conclusion
*  of that paper, they say that what you're probably seeing is a more generic computational ability
*  of primary modality cortex that can do a similar thing on basic inputs. That's the conclusion
*  of those authors themselves.
*  Now if you look at the perinatal stroke case where kids can lose the entire left hemisphere
*  and in a subset of those people you can see language take over in the other hemisphere.
*  You know, work by Elissa Newport and others and many others. They also conclude that it's
*  not reorganization because that area of the cortex, it's exactly in the homolog that it
*  happens. It's not in any other area of cortex. It's in the homolog. It's in the mirror image
*  structures with the same input and output relations, the same footprint, fingerprint
*  as Richard Parsingham calls it. So in other words, there is a capacity already in the
*  homolog and we know that from studies even in adults in people who haven't had hemisperectomies
*  or perinatal strokes that you can bring online in normal adults the non-dominant hemisphere
*  for linguistic purposes. So it was always there. What would be really weird is if the
*  prefrontal cortex or the occipital cortex suddenly became language cortex. But it doesn't.
*  It doesn't.
*  Maybe we haven't seen dramatic enough examples of that yet.
*  So in other words what I'm saying is all I would say to you, Paul, is read the paper
*  from beginning to end example after example and I would challenge you to be able to really
*  mount a credible counter argument. And then I would simply ask you why are you? In other
*  words is it because there's a cherished desire to hold on to this notion or is it because
*  it really still is the best, most parsimonious explanation for what's going on? And all
*  I'm saying is we don't have an axe to grind. It's just that the very fact that you're having
*  the response you're having reinforces I think for me and for Tamar that it was worth writing
*  the paper.
*  Yeah. I look forward to reading the manuscript which I have not looked at as you've mentioned.
*  Yeah, yeah, it's fine. No, but I'm just saying that it's not oh, God, here's John and co
*  trying to undermine. It's just that everything deserves a second look if not a third look.
*  Do you know what I'm saying?
*  Sure. Yeah.
*  And the other thing is these notions of Adrian Haith is working on a very interesting book
*  paper on internal models, simulation, which goes back a little bit to the conversation
*  we were having. There are very, there are many cherished ideas that continue to be used
*  not because they are likely to be what's really going on, but because they are very amenable
*  to formalism. I think model-based reinforcement learning is really an example of that where
*  there's just so much fun mathematically that it holds far more sway than over what may
*  be really happening in animals.
*  What I...
*  Go ahead.
*  And I don't know why that. I think that's, so that's basically, we need to sort of have
*  conceptual frameworks that are really fun to live in, which is, you know, arguably what
*  Freud did, right? Freud constructed a conceptual framework that you could think about everyday
*  life in. It was fun, right? It's the same with astrology, right? It's fun to say, oh
*  my God, he's a Leo, she's an Aries, right? It somehow helps us navigate complex things
*  by having frameworks. And, you know, I'm not claiming that reinforcement learning is like
*  astrology or psychoanalysis. All I'm saying is that the desire for premature closure with
*  conceptual frameworks is something that we should fight and always try and break those
*  models rather than generate existence proof for them. Right? And I think there's some
*  weakness, I don't know where it's come from, where instead of trying to break things, people
*  are trying to prove things.
*  Yeah. Well, I think it's a lot lower barrier to thinking if you accept a framework, right?
*  Instead of always questioning the framework that you're working from. I was going to ask
*  you this broadly then, directly related to the manuscript that you were just describing.
*  So when I interviewed for graduate school, I had been a technician for a couple years
*  and I did some slice mouse visual cortex plasticity work where you stimulate with a certain protocol
*  and try to induce plasticity. You put a Finpredil or drugs on there to reduce NMDA mediated
*  plasticity anyway. And at the time, and I think still is the case, that all learning
*  is plasticity, synaptic plasticity, even though work like in recurrent neural networks shows
*  that you can have non-plasticity learning. Anyway, during an interview for my entrance
*  into grad school, in the interview process, the faculty member said, so what do you think?
*  Is plasticity important for learning and memory? I was sort of like taken aback a little
*  bit because I didn't really know what to say at the time. And I said, well, I should hope
*  so because there's been a lot of work done on it. So anyway, my question to you then,
*  John, is like given, you know, going through the research that you went through, how much
*  is plasticity? How important is synaptic plasticity in the brain of let's say adults?
*  If that's too ridiculous of a question for you to address, I understand.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's not ridiculous. I think obviously from the point of view of
*  things that I care about in my everyday lab life, motor skill learning and recovery from
*  brain injury, I mean, it's undeniable, I think, that strengthening of connections is fundamental.
*  Right? Where I think it's much more interesting and, you know, I defer to, you know, the incredible
*  work that's beginning to question synaptic basis for memory, for example. And you've
*  had some amazing sort of podcasts about that. Yeah. I think, you know, and you had my great
*  friend David Poppalon, right, where I think this is an incredible example of where the
*  regime of importance in the brain for things like cognition and memory versus the regime
*  of use of substrate for sensorimotor behavior may be different. I mean, wouldn't it be interesting
*  if the same substrate was configured and used in a slightly different way, right, for
*  these different functions? And it's maybe, I mean, and, you know, people are claiming
*  you don't need neurons for all sorts of intelligent behavior. Right. So it leads to the question,
*  maybe you need neurons when you're, you know, an elephant trunk or giraffe neck or long
*  legs with axons going all the way from the brain to the toe. And I think that's a very
*  interesting, you know, and you need muscles to contract and all that. But when it comes
*  to the regime for remembering things or thinking about things, you're inside the brain. You
*  don't have to go all the way down to your toe. Maybe it's a different regime. And I
*  think that's what's been very interesting about this discussion opening up is it's a
*  little bit banal to say, oh, synaptic plasticity is important. It's too short a sentence to
*  sort of convey the complexity of the issue. And, you know, it'd be like saying, hey, you
*  know, you live in Pittsburgh. Explain Pittsburgh to me. Right. Well, actually, that wouldn't
*  take that long. But so I think that it's obviously a property of the nervous system that's been
*  exploited of huge importance to the kind of work on motor learning and on recovery.
*  Whether it's the sine qua non and the locus to think about memory and cognition, especially
*  as you say, there are many examples where you can have these effects without, you know,
*  like hierarchical reinforcement learning, the wonderful work by Matt Botvinick where
*  basically you can have these things happen without having to invoke synaptic weight changes.
*  I don't know. I think it's, you know, I'm rambling on a bit here, but what I would
*  say is important for what? Right. And what specifically are you asking about? Because
*  there are many other properties of the nervous system that we should be interested in. You
*  know, also, Earl Miller, you know, we had him on the learning salon and, you know, the
*  whole issue of oscillations. And I think he made the point really well, which is, you
*  know, why are we not sending out all our hounds? We don't know what regime is used
*  by the nervous system. Maybe evolution, as we know, is incredibly good at squeezing out
*  function from all sorts of features. And maybe the nervous system has features at multiple
*  scales from oscillations to synapses. And we don't know under particular behaviors which
*  scale and regime is the one being having the most weight put on it to the point. Do you
*  see what I'm saying? And I, so I think the way, I think it's been, and this is what I
*  meant going all the way back to the beginning of the discussion with you. The great value
*  of your show is to have open discussions with people saying, you know what, this, this story
*  is far from over. And the synapse hegemon, right, is the one that's been, you know,
*  we need to, we need to release ourselves from its shackles a little bit and breathe a little
*  bit and think about all the potential options. And that's why it was so interesting to have
*  Earl on and to have, you know, people like Sam Gershman and others who are saying, wait
*  a minute, you know, let's rethink this. And so I think it's a very exciting time to sort
*  of just open one's eyes a little bit. And that's why I'm in no way with our reorganization
*  paper saying that synaptic plasticity doesn't exist. Of course we're not. We're saying in
*  fact that vanilla synaptic plasticity is sufficient to explain phenomena that seem to require
*  something special and you don't need to invoke it.
*  You just said that it's a wonderful time or an exciting time. And it struck me that I
*  was having somewhat the opposite thought that it's an even more daunting time because
*  if you have the ability to squeeze out functions from different combinations of and levels
*  of biological activity and regimes, then it becomes harder to tell a nice clean story,
*  right? You become less confident that you're even looking under the right lamp post at
*  it for the keys, right? At any given moment. And I'm not sure what you think about that.
*  I mean, I agree that it's exciting. I also think, oh, now I need to account for the different
*  combinations of oscillations and neurotransmitters and plasticity and circuitry and heterorharchical
*  properties. So there's just a lot to account for in the dimension of explanation.
*  But it's interesting that what you're doing in your description of the frustration of it all is
*  you're going all the way back to kind of Mar, right? And Nick Krieger's Quarters also talked
*  about it, which is maybe you should start with the behavior, the function, the task, do a task
*  level analysis, you know, and then start worrying about the details of how it's done.
*  So, you know, here's an animal, its task is to transport itself from A to B, give it body
*  shape. But you still have to adjudicate. Eventually you have to adjudicate.
*  But in our neuroscience needs behavior paper, we tried to see that there was an arrow of doing
*  it, which is what's the behavior, what's the task that needs to be done, what's the function,
*  and then have an algorithmic description of it and then break the tie with implementation work.
*  I mean, I still feel even, you know, what is it now, seven years later, whatever that paper came out,
*  that there was still a logic of going in that direction, right?
*  I think bypassing it by going to simpler and simpler systems where you get the circuit immediately,
*  right? Sort of the sort of we mocked a little bit in that paper, the sort of computational, you know,
*  mechanistic cognitive neuroscience, the Janelia sort of website with Vivek, where the idea is,
*  well, if you get to a simple enough system and you already are at the level of the implementation
*  and you're allowed to call what's happening there cognition, you can short circuit that sequence that
*  we wrote about in that paper. But I don't think that you can bypass that sequence by getting to a system
*  that a single cell or an insect and say, look, I'm going to be sharing Tonian on cognition because I've got
*  such a simple system and I'm allowed to call what it's doing cognition and then I'll extrapolate, right?
*  That's, I think, the alternative approach. What we're going to do for cognition in an insect,
*  what Sherrington did for reflexes in the cat. I don't think so. I think, you know,
*  and I think one of the interesting things that AI is giving us and I think Sam Gershman on his Twitter feed
*  has made this provocative point is how much is neuroscience really contributing to our insights about cognition
*  that we're not simply getting at the task level by doing AI, right? And I think there's been some objections
*  to him, but I tend to agree with his position, which is that task analysis, psychological cognitive science
*  and then programming it into AI is doing more than circuit analysis for the higher level phenomena.
*  Doing more to what? It's more progress, I think, towards the understanding of cognition is going to happen
*  through a combination of cognitive science, behavioral analysis, task analysis and programming computers
*  than doing circuit analysis on lower organisms and then extrapolating from them.
*  Do you think that same statement applies to wanting to understand the biological basis of cognition?
*  Or are you just allowing cognition to be its own function? You know, it's so if you're implementation level agnostic,
*  I completely agree with you. But if you're interested in the, let's say the brain and how the brain does it,
*  does that statement still hold? Well, it gets comes back all the way to what my brother calls emergence
*  is when does the understanding require looking under the hood? Right? And what you're implying is
*  it may well be that you need to look under the hood to understand cognition, but maybe you don't.
*  Maybe just like, you know, the example he gives in a talk he gave last year, you know, if you want to understand
*  my brother, when you want to understand Fermat's Last Theorem, how it was proven on the page, pencil and paper,
*  it's irrelevant to the truth of Fermat's Last Theorem, what the state of the brain of Andrew Wiles.
*  So in other words, there are situations under which the explanatory framework is autonomous from the lower level.
*  It's screened off, right? And so all I'm saying is, is it may well be that the principles of cognition
*  that lead us to think we're understanding how the human brain do it may borrow from research done in AI
*  where a more substrate independent conceptual framework can apply that doesn't require you to look under the biological hood.
*  Now, I'm no way am I claiming functionalism all the way.
*  But, you know, I think that one could say that AI is showing to us that functionalism can do quite a lot.
*  If it's based on what was known about brains 70, 100 years ago already.
*  But I'm not convinced that the advances in AI that lead to more AGI like effects, and, you know, I'm a skeptic about it,
*  but you'd have to be a little bit of a strange extremist to say that there isn't a possibility.
*  And that's another discussion as to why we might not get to AGI for biological reasons.
*  I do want to make a final point, just, and I had this discussion with David Chalmers.
*  I'm very sympathetic to the idea that you need consciousness for system two thinking.
*  And I was also talking to Antonio de Mazi about this briefly in Portugal.
*  And it may well be that consciousness like pain is biological substrate dependent.
*  So ironically, it may well be that for the type of cognition that you and I are doing on this podcast,
*  you can't be functionalist and just algorithmic.
*  You have to combine functionalism with biological substrate to have things like consciousness.
*  In other words, I really want to make it very clear.
*  I may end up not being a pure functionalist once it comes to overt, aware cognition.
*  Which you think would be necessary to get to AGI.
*  It may or may not be necessary to get to AGI.
*  At the moment, if I had to put a stake in the ground, I would say that AGI will require system two,
*  like Yoshua has said, Mengio and others.
*  And it may well be that you come full circle and to get there, you're going to need biological substrate.
*  And then you can't be functionalist.
*  But when it comes to algorithmic intelligence, system one, you can be functionalist.
*  Do you see what I'm saying?
*  Yeah, I do. And I think that I agree with you if I had to put my own stake in the ground as well.
*  I mean, part of the exercise of learning more and more about cognition for my own sake is actually going away
*  somewhat from functionalism for things like higher cognition.
*  Yeah, and you know, when you read people, yeah, yeah, you know, and you read, you know,
*  I don't know if you have ever had Mark Solmes on the show.
*  Nope, not yet.
*  You know, his book, The Hidden Spring.
*  Now, I vehemently disagree with where he goes at the end of his book, but it's really good in terms of how it covers,
*  you know, he does an amazing thing where he combines the drives of Freud with all the drives that are brainstem dependent in neuroscience
*  and saying that without those, you know, it goes all the way back to the Greeks, you know,
*  the difference between the passions and the reasons and maybe you need them both.
*  Right.
*  And when I was speaking to David on the show about that, he said, Oh, John, that's very dichotomous of you.
*  That's just what I was thinking.
*  And like all, yeah, and all dichotomies end up being simplistic.
*  True.
*  But I am not a functionalist all the way to these kinds of discussions and how the brain is doing it.
*  I mean, I because in the end, an AI is going to have to care to have a discussion where there's no obvious cost function.
*  I mean, what's the cost function of this discussion you and I are having?
*  Right. What are we optimizing for?
*  Right. It's so open ended.
*  Right. So in other words, it's almost as though open endedness is the feature that we have.
*  Kenneth Stanley would like to say.
*  Open endedness.
*  Who would?
*  Ken Stanley.
*  He's the open evolutionary.
*  Oh, yeah, I know Ken Stanley.
*  So I just want to make I don't want to come across as sort of a sort of strident functionalist all the way up far from it.
*  So in other words, you know, in terms of my own trajectory, it's like very substrate dependent work on stroke recovery and hemiparesis through functionalism to a belief again at the other end in substrate dependence.
*  It's almost dinosaur shaped, you know, tail, big body and then long again.
*  You know, I hope that but I hope that doesn't sound completely incoherent.
*  It doesn't to me. But who knows how it'll sound to the listeners.
*  All right. Well, here let's let's end the episode.
