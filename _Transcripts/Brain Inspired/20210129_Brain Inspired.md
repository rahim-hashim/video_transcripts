# BI 096 Keisuke Fukuda and Josh Cosman: Forking Paths
**Brain Inspired:** [January 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGbxVacFDKE)
*  And now here we are.
*  Kay is a faculty member and happy Kay?
*  I totally am.
*  This is my dream job.
*  And Josh, happy?
*  Absolutely, yes.
*  I definitely made the right choice.
*  I always wished that I was like, you know, early 1900s.
*  Oh my god, of course.
*  All these little ideas that you have that are so impactful but people hadn't thought
*  about them yet.
*  I see the frustration, right?
*  Some psychology thing, terminology that's introduced in psychology is really, really
*  elusive and sometimes cryptic.
*  That sometimes is really frustrating to boil it down into more understandable, more measurable
*  neural activities.
*  But what do you wish you knew?
*  That it's impossible.
*  That's really hard to do.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Hello, welcome.
*  It's Paul.
*  So we occasionally on the podcast have talked about the relationship between psychology
*  and neuroscience.
*  And we've spent an entire episode actually with Yuri Buzhaki and David Popol discussing
*  the merits and possible primacy of each of those disciplines with respect to learning
*  about brains and minds and the relations between brains and minds.
*  And I realized recently that I have a few friends who have experienced both sides, psychology
*  and neuroscience.
*  So specifically, they both had psychology backgrounds and spent a couple of years with
*  me in a monkey neurophysiology lab recording neurons while monkeys performed tasks to relate
*  the neural activity to mental function.
*  So I was interested in their perspectives on the psychology neuroscience relationship.
*  So this episode is quite casual.
*  We step back a little bit and I asked my friends, Keisuke Fukuda and Josh Kosman to come on.
*  The three of us were postdocs together in that neurophysiology lab where I got to know
*  them and really enjoy both of them.
*  But we've taken three quite different paths from there.
*  So Keisuke, also known as K, went on to a faculty position at the University of Toronto
*  where he uses EEG to study human minds.
*  Josh, on the other hand, left academia after the postdoc and has had a series of industry
*  jobs since then.
*  And he's currently at the biopharmaceutical company AbbVie where he applies his science
*  skills to actually help humans.
*  And then there's me desperately scrambling to make self-employment work.
*  But anyway, I thought it would be fun to have them on and reflect and retrospect about the
*  trajectories of our own thought processes in life and in science, some lessons they've
*  learned along the way.
*  And we also, of course, talk about the role of AI and psychology and neuroscience and
*  various other sundries.
*  So this is a less technical and more open discussion, which I know pleases some of the
*  listeners some of the time.
*  And this pleases some other listeners some of the other time.
*  So c'est la vie.
*  You can hear full episodes and get other bells and whistles by supporting the show on Patreon,
*  so consider doing that.
*  And you can learn more about Josh and K and connect with them on Twitter and that kind
*  of jazz in the show notes at braininspired.co.uk.
*  It is good to have friends like these, and I hope you do too.
*  Man, good to see you guys.
*  It's been how long has it been Josh?
*  I've Skyped with K once or twice, but has it been three or four years since I've seen
*  you?
*  I left.
*  When did I leave academics?
*  It was June, mid June of 2016.
*  Had to been around there.
*  Yeah.
*  So K, Josh and I were all postdocs in the same, I guess, two labs, Jeff Schaal's lab
*  and Jeff Woodman's lab at Vanderbilt University.
*  And we all shared an office for a time.
*  And K has even brushed my children's teeth one evening.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And K, I've brushed Josh's teeth, but that's a long story.
*  Oh, man.
*  Can we trade that part of memory, please?
*  They still have no cavities.
*  My children don't have any cavities.
*  So did a good job.
*  Your dad was a dentist, right?
*  That's right.
*  Yeah, I was trained right.
*  That's where you learn those skills.
*  So guys, let's just get into it.
*  I guess we'll start with you, K, because you stayed in academia, right?
*  You are the academic among us.
*  Yeah, haven't left yet.
*  Yet.
*  Like that.
*  No, no.
*  So what do you do, K?
*  Yep.
*  So I am an assistant professor.
*  This is my fourth year.
*  No, actually, no, I cracked it already.
*  Fifth year at this job.
*  I am at University of Toronto, Mississauga.
*  I'm running a research lab.
*  I'm looking at visual memory and attention using No-Tech Physics and EEG recording.
*  And 40% of the other time I'll be devoting for teaching.
*  That's a big chunk.
*  Is that a bigger chunk than usual, 40%?
*  I think it's normal.
*  40% research, 40% teaching and 20% service is the textbook distribution of the work time.
*  And often you fish on the side.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yes, I do fish.
*  That's my hobby.
*  Part of the reason why I joke to my students is that the reason why I'm in research is
*  in part because I suck at fishing, but I still love it.
*  Great.
*  And Josh, you got out of academia.
*  You took the shackles off, so to speak, or maybe not.
*  So Josh, actually I know you worked for Pfizer, but then I think you've recently changed jobs.
*  Is it AbbVie?
*  Yeah, I work at AbbVie now.
*  I've worked at three companies since I left.
*  So it's been a crazy four and a half years.
*  So I guess when I left, I left to take a job at Pfizer.
*  I was interviewing for faculty jobs.
*  Some of those ultimately ended up coming through, but it was after I had committed to going
*  to Pfizer.
*  I don't think it would have changed anything.
*  I think if I would have taken a faculty position, I mean, in my mind, I would have just picked
*  back up and started looking for other interesting things to do, knowing that, you know, 10-year
*  pressure would be coming and the fun of my life would go away pretty quickly.
*  So I think I did the right thing, at least in my case.
*  And so I left to go to Pfizer, spent about a year and a half there.
*  And you might know, I mean, I'm sure some people listening might know, Pfizer left neuroscience
*  entirely.
*  So they were sort of the first, you know, back in the old days when we finally started
*  knowing how Alzheimer's might mechanistically work or Parkinson's disease, they pumped
*  a bunch of money into that because they had money.
*  They were a major pharma.
*  We didn't know enough, obviously, to make drugs that worked.
*  We didn't know enough about how to measure the patients.
*  And so years of failure leads to, you know, what's the point of doing this?
*  Let's just chill out on this for a while and maybe we'll get back in when somebody makes
*  it work.
*  So they left neuroscience.
*  I left Pfizer.
*  I went to Biogen, which was, they are strictly neuroscience all the time.
*  It was really a pretty good company.
*  Ultimately, I left there to go to Abbott about six months ago now.
*  So all during the pandemic to take just another position that was a little bit higher up.
*  I had a little bit more oversight over things, more of a leadership role.
*  So that's, I'm at Abbott right now doing digital work.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you do on a daily basis?
*  Meetings?
*  I go outside Zoom all day.
*  You captured it.
*  It's all Zoom all the time.
*  Well, I mean, it depends.
*  So when we're physically at the office, at least at both Pfizer and Biogen, a major thing
*  that I helped do when I got there was set up infrastructure to do like lab-based experiments.
*  So it's not something, I mean, it's super common in preclinical like biology, working
*  with animal models, developing the assets themselves, the drugs themselves.
*  But it's less common to do human research in a pharmaceutical setting.
*  But equally important.
*  And that's something that I think companies have started to realize.
*  And they've built out, I mean, many of them have built out lab spaces.
*  And so that's one of the things that I took on when I was at both Pfizer and Biogen and
*  now at Abbott, trying to build some capabilities to do the kind of work that we've done in
*  the lab setting for most of our career.
*  So it sounds like you didn't have much of a difficult decision leaving academia then,
*  Josh.
*  No, I mean, so when I got into academics, I had some questions that I wanted to answer,
*  stuff I was interested in.
*  I think you were already doing stuff in the background.
*  Well, I mean, it was all for a common goal.
*  I mean, you don't join like, you know, I joined Shaw's lab not to do digital, you know, not
*  to use mobile phones to collect data from people out in the world.
*  That's just not a thing that the lab does.
*  It's equally important to me to provide some picture of what behavior in the brain do out
*  in the real world.
*  But there was more focused on the basic research stuff.
*  So I mean, I kind of necessarily had to have two independent research lines going simultaneously
*  just to fulfill answering my own questions.
*  So was that really a transition or wasn't even a transition for you when you decided
*  to leave academia?
*  I mean, it was it wasn't a way.
*  I mean, there's there's a lot less.
*  I think there's a lot more emphasis on getting real world type of evidence in the pharmaceutical
*  development setting because, you know, you can give somebody a treatment.
*  They're taking it for two plus years.
*  They may have a neurodegenerative condition, you know, that that's not a lab based thing
*  that you can can really do.
*  But ultimately, the kinds of questions it's taking all the stuff we do in a lab and trying
*  to make that work out in the world.
*  Why would you want to do that?
*  That's because it's hard and it's the payoff is good.
*  If it works, it's it's a huge deal.
*  And it's starting to work.
*  So I mean, it was it was definitely a risk leaving.
*  But it's something you got to do at some point, because I think there's never a real emphasis
*  on translating any of the stuff that we do in basic research.
*  I mean, almost none at all other than throw away lines in our grants.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And I was much more focused on that application after I answered my own basic science questions.
*  So that's that's sort of for me.
*  That's how I ended up where I am.
*  You guys both kind of came from more of a psychology background, at least more than
*  I did. Right.
*  And so you guys were kind of coming into a neurophysiology, monkey neurophysiology
*  laboratory as a new thing as a postdoc, sort of.
*  Yeah. And I was basically continuing my monkey neurophysiology
*  experience going into my postdoc.
*  So we kind of came at it from different angles.
*  And now here we are.
*  Kay is a faculty member and happy.
*  Kay, I totally am.
*  This is my dream job.
*  Yeah. So that's great.
*  And Josh, happy.
*  Absolutely. Yes.
*  I like me. I definitely made the right choice.
*  Why have I not? I've never heard anyone who's gone to industry who's made that choice.
*  I've never heard anyone regret doing it.
*  It's I mean, like I mentioned to you before, I mean, you traded one set of problems for
*  another one. But but honestly, from a work life balance standpoint, it definitely
*  depends where you're at and what you're doing.
*  I would say, you know, you know, just on the whole, it's a little bit better.
*  You you get paid better.
*  There's a lot more downtime if you want it, but you you don't necessarily always get
*  it. And I think for me, it's just I I see a clear application for the work that I'm
*  doing. You know, the stuff that the experiments that I plan, the data that I collect,
*  that all goes to support showing that a drug worked.
*  And that's different than publishing a paper.
*  And Kay, how is it your dream job?
*  What makes it your dream job?
*  I keep you know, I was I got into grad school for a reason and I loved it.
*  That's why I stick in academia and I get to do I get to be in the same part of the
*  game, different role that I play.
*  But still, I get to do what I fell in love with.
*  So that's great.
*  Right. I'm not saying that the job hasn't changed.
*  It has changed quite a bit.
*  You know, I have now responsibilities in training my trainees and things.
*  And that's, again, a different set of problems, not maybe as large of a qualitative
*  jump than going into industry, maybe.
*  But for me, that is the added challenge.
*  Yeah, that's usually end up that ends up being the things that haunt my the last
*  moment of thinking before I go into sleep.
*  It's like, oh, I could have said this instead of that.
*  You know, well, actually, that's that's the part of my day.
*  What I miss more than anything is being able to just go into the lab and tinker with
*  things and be, I mean, be when you're the rate limiting factor.
*  That's an awesome thing, because if you want to go as hard as you want to go, there's
*  you can always get something for it.
*  It's all at your own pace.
*  I mean, that's actually what I really liked about monkey research.
*  If I was willing to sit in a rig for eight hours a day every day and collect data,
*  God, you know, it was I'm the rate limiting factor there in pharmaceutical industry.
*  I can plan an experiment.
*  I don't see the end of that experiment for five years.
*  It's the least gratifying part of my job.
*  Yeah. So in a sense, that's slow.
*  But I was going to correct you and say that monkey research is also relative to, let's
*  say, human research, right?
*  Like, you know, putting an EG cap on someone, something piloting something in like two
*  days, right?
*  That's subject. Yeah.
*  And a pilot for a monkey is like months and months.
*  And yeah, I guess you're there.
*  You're not really the rate limiting factor in a monkey lab because you have to sit in
*  there. Well, when you're recording only a few cells at a time, which is different these
*  days, you have to sit in there eight hours a day for months, you know, to get anything
*  worthwhile. So I don't know, it's just really slow.
*  And that's one of the frustrations that I had in academia is how in that particular
*  setting is how slow it is.
*  But the amount of the weight of evidence that you accumulate, I agree with, you know,
*  Ross's point. I know it was Popple's point, Dr. Popple's point, that the weight of the
*  evidence that it carries is so much more when, you know, depending on the question, I
*  think, if the question is to tie in mind to the brain, then that's the that's the
*  that's it really is a new activity.
*  I feel like that's changing. I'm not sure that the monkeys are still a golden standard.
*  I don't really know because I'm I'm I'm the only person here who is, quote unquote,
*  self-employed, which just means poor.
*  So you guys are making pretty good money.
*  And I got out and chose not to go to industry or stay in academia.
*  I chose to be poor and do a podcast.
*  Yeah, you've got your freedom, man.
*  You can't. That's right.
*  Yeah, you can't trade it for anything.
*  My my dream state is that five years from now, I will have exhausted my interest in
*  this part of my career as well.
*  I'm going to just end up living where you live and I'm going to go off the grid.
*  That's that's like my my dream goal.
*  And I'll get there soon.
*  But I don't see I'm not going to do this for another 20 years.
*  There's no way I'm not going to be a 65 year old man in the pharmaceutical industry
*  running experiments. I mean, I would kill myself.
*  So you don't have that. I don't I don't know that many people have that dream of, you
*  know, work until you're 65 and retire.
*  And that's when life starts. I'm not sure many people have that still.
*  I don't know. What do you guys think?
*  I'm living my dream.
*  Yeah. Well, OK. So that's different because you never retire.
*  You got tenure and then you can, you know, right.
*  Go on and on.
*  I it was like what we were talking about before.
*  I mean, I I'm sort of a cynical dude and that that does not is not compatible with
*  like a long term, very focused career on one thing.
*  I mean, you realize holes in everything that's going on pretty quickly.
*  You try to do your best to plug the holes for your own sort of research or whatever
*  your goals are. But, you know, they're still going to be there.
*  And it's really hard to have any sort of global change over any of that.
*  So you're better off just to you satisfy your own curiosities and move on
*  versus I mean, maybe I could have tried to stick around and make things better.
*  But, you know, I did just it's not just academics.
*  I feel that in my current career. At some point, when you've exhausted your own
*  curiosity, then there's really no reason for you to continue being there.
*  It's just you're miserable.
*  Well, so one of the I was watching a talk, I think by Philip Sabies,
*  and he was comparing industry and academia.
*  And one of the keys to success from his vantage point
*  in something that seems to be important in academia
*  is people are concerned with their legacy.
*  And I don't care about my legacy, Josh.
*  You probably don't. I don't know that you care about your legacy.
*  But that's yeah, you've pinpointed it.
*  I could not care less if my name is attached to anything that ever happens
*  going forward. But if I feel like I did something to contribute to a drug
*  getting approved or something along those lines, I mean, I I actually
*  cherish not having to have my name attached to everything.
*  It's a great thing.
*  I get to free myself from those shackles.
*  And now it's just sort of like a team goal and you move forward and everything's good.
*  But the interesting thing is, Kay, you don't I don't know that you care about legacy.
*  It would be a lie if I don't care who ends up becoming an author in a paper.
*  Right. Especially until I get tenure.
*  But I carry it for that reason that I need to secure my job.
*  But, you know, the deepest thing, I don't really care.
*  The deepest down in my heart, I don't really care.
*  The legacy people will still remember my name.
*  I don't care.
*  I do my research because I want to know what's happening,
*  not from reading necessarily, but from doing.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  We so little secret, Kay does not read.
*  That's that's wrong.
*  Don't say that. Don't say that.
*  Who knows who might be listening to this?
*  I walked in on you reading Nelson and Norens, a metacognition paper.
*  And I was like, oh, you like metacognition?
*  That was a monkey lab.
*  One moment. One moment. Yeah.
*  But that's the secret to your success, Kay.
*  You read reading stuff is like that's that's a nail in the coffin.
*  You don't read.
*  Just be a smart person that's out and able to do things.
*  That's yeah.
*  I I wish I didn't read as much.
*  Maybe I'd still be an academic, so I didn't read actually.
*  Yeah, well, this is something I say to students that they will
*  by pre emphasizing that you shouldn't be listening to me too much.
*  But I tell them to be careful when you read stuff.
*  I tell them to be careful not read it too much front end.
*  Right. Face the questions.
*  We need some couple of papers really well and then create the questions
*  and run couple of experiments like polls pointed out.
*  Human behavioral research doesn't take that long to collect pilot data.
*  Right. So we can be swift in testing out some basic
*  assumptions and then go wild from there.
*  And that, I think, has to happen at some point earlier in a career
*  to see whether you're fit for this kind of job.
*  But you can't be doing something based on what you read.
*  You have to be somebody who's original in creating ideas,
*  I think, to actually make the most of it and to get the most fun out of it,
*  at least in my opinion.
*  And I think I am living that by example.
*  Is the way that I know that's my excuse.
*  I read, though I read when I have to.
*  Well, yeah, what about what about reviews?
*  I'm sure you've got your own look for paper reviews.
*  I mean, I'm still reviewing papers and I have no reason to do it.
*  Josh, you can say no.
*  Well, yeah, I like to have the same reason why I listen to Paul's podcast.
*  Come on. I like to just scratch the surface and still be involved
*  enough to know that nothing has changed in the five years that I've been.
*  Just to confirm you made the right decision.
*  I mean, the funny thing is I actually read more papers now than I ever have before,
*  just because I mean, every 10 days or whatever, I have to try to attempt
*  to learn almost everything about someone's research, right?
*  Which means I really have to dive in.
*  But it's super fun.
*  And, you know, this is like the most rewarding vocation that I have ever had.
*  So this is great. We have three happy people who why were we so unhappy
*  when we shared that office space?
*  Because we're sitting in a dark room
*  with monkey brains and had no access to food or drink for eight hours at a time.
*  No, I think we were happy.
*  I think we were happily sharing that unhappy moments of life
*  and knowing that it's not forever.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, some part of that happiness was just knowing you guys.
*  I mean, it's really it's really just great to see you.
*  So yeah, it's making me happy.
*  And the whiskey is helping as well.
*  So we're going to come back a little bit later, I think,
*  to answer some of these questions about, you know,
*  reflections and looking back and career.
*  But let's get into a little bit of science, because I'm curious,
*  you know, how your minds have changed and developed and how you, you know,
*  reflect on what you used to think and things like that.
*  But what I want to know first off is I would love to hear your favorite
*  or best scientific moment like that.
*  Do you do you have people tend to have these like a moment
*  that like sticks out on their head, whether it's, you know,
*  the discovery of something or some sort of experience.
*  And, Josh, it doesn't have to be in academia.
*  It can be, you know, in your current line of work as well.
*  Maybe, Josh, we'll start with you. How about?
*  Yeah, it's totally in academia.
*  It was when I heard cells for the first time that I was recording from.
*  I mean, there are very few things that stick out to me.
*  I mean, done a lot of things, but I didn't care that much about most of them.
*  But hearing hearing cells when I drove, you know,
*  a electrode down for the first time, that's a it's a pretty cool thing.
*  And honestly, it doesn't really ever lose its coolness.
*  It really doesn't. I love it.
*  I would still love to listen to cells, although not for eight hours a day every day.
*  Yeah, it was.
*  I mean, it's like I don't think I have a negative thing I could point to.
*  But from from sort of a cool scientific like, oh, this is totally worth
*  what I'm doing right now. It was it was hearing neurons.
*  Yeah, that's pretty powerful.
*  OK, what about you? Anything stick out in your mind?
*  It's like, you know, the morning shower that I take and when the idea hits you,
*  that's the best moment for me. Right.
*  It's not about finding something.
*  It's about when you figure out what question to ask is when to me,
*  the best moment, most exciting moment.
*  Do you have a favorite among those, like a favorite question
*  that you think, oh, that was the one.
*  Yeah. So this is related to when we on the project that we did with Jeff
*  Woodman 2015, that's the paper.
*  And that's when the paper came up.
*  This is when we tried to use single trial
*  EEG recording to change behavior, to, you know, make some impacting behavior.
*  And we know that single trial EEG data is really noisy. Right.
*  But what we wanted to do is we know that it's noisy,
*  but is there any way to harness that online data to impact,
*  you know, change behavior later on, particularly in the context
*  of enhancing memory and coding success? Right.
*  So we'll be recording EEG during the memory task
*  where they present it with pictures to remember.
*  And we want to use that EEG recording to see whether a certain information
*  is remembered or not.
*  In the past, people have shown that those EEG recording can be used
*  to differentiate what's better remembered or not.
*  But nobody knew whether it can be used as a single trial.
*  But so we had to come up with a clever way to show, to use these single trial EEG
*  to sort out the trials that we can use to enhance memory versus not.
*  And I've been thinking about it for a long time,
*  couldn't come to a really good way.
*  And I've been thinking about it overnight and stuff like that.
*  And one morning you wake up, right.
*  And then you realize, oh, you just have to do is just sort the trials
*  based on EEG signals.
*  You know, it's noisy.
*  But if there's enough trials, you're going to catch some of those, right?
*  Gold can be hidden.
*  It can be hidden in the sand that you, you know, scrub off the
*  bottom of the river or something, just like that.
*  And I didn't know that it's going to work, but it did work.
*  The happy moment.
*  But the most exciting time is when you come up with that idea.
*  Was that in the shower? Yeah, in the shower.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Why does the shower seem to be a real, I don't know, it's a place.
*  It's the only place you're not thinking of any other thing.
*  I mean, I run for that reason.
*  But, you know, it's hard to clear your head for any period of time.
*  Got the warm water dripping over you.
*  Nothing to think about, but those sort of problems in the back of your mind.
*  I think a lot when I run, you know, what's better for me is snowboarding, I think.
*  And a lot of people choose something like rock climbing,
*  where you have to be so focused on what you're doing, that you just don't.
*  You can't, you know, think of anything.
*  And that's, you know, that's the zone out kind of activity.
*  And snowboarding does that for me out here near off grid.
*  Josh, you should come visit. It's awesome.
*  I would just I would just want to say I think I need to wait a couple of years
*  so that I'm not like, oh, I've got to move. Yeah.
*  Another thing that Philip Sabies,
*  he was talking about the value of if you're in academia,
*  well, and industry, the value of experiencing as many different
*  varieties of labs, of scientific questions and settings as you can
*  with regards to like your growth as professionally and just mentally,
*  which leads me to the question,
*  since you guys are both, you know, from the psychology world,
*  but then you did a stint as postdocs basically in a monkey neurophysiology lab.
*  Like what that experience did for you, did it did it?
*  You know, was it satisfying?
*  Would it confirm that you didn't want to be in a monkey neurophysiology
*  lab much longer or, you know, did it?
*  Did it scratch that itch that you had?
*  You know, like, what are your reflections on having experienced
*  a real brain heavy side of it as opposed to the psychology heavy side of it?
*  I still think that I was the same person.
*  I I am a psychologist in neuroscience.
*  It's a still to is a tool, right?
*  Again, it carries a really heavy weight in terms of the evidence that it can supply.
*  But didn't really change the way that I think.
*  But I'm really happy that I saw how that evidence is collected
*  and how powerful it can be.
*  Yeah. I mean, if you if you have a specific question in mind,
*  I mean, I followed a question through from like, you know, it was like a little
*  like a little kindling burning during undergrad and followed it through
*  on a pretty linear.
*  I mean, I did a ton of extra stuff on the side to like stay interested.
*  But the core question I was approaching, it was it was completely like
*  it was all along the same trajectory.
*  And it like all just completed the picture for me.
*  I felt like I felt a lot better leaving academics, having sort of done
*  the end to end to answer the one question I was interested in.
*  Then probably if I didn't do that.
*  And I mean, for me, like like you said, I'm a psychologist.
*  I got into this because I like psychology.
*  I skipped medical school and I thought I wanted to be a neurologist
*  because I realized that there was psychology and cognitive psychology was a thing.
*  And I got interested in that.
*  I understood that that that was more what I was interested in.
*  And the brain gives me a mechanistic explanation for what I observe
*  in the person.
*  And it can be in the lab or it can be me talking to somebody on the street.
*  But that's that's what I wanted to get.
*  I feel like I got that.
*  Don't you think that people that every neuroscientist or 90
*  something percent of them start off like I did, wanting to understand minds
*  and what essentially boils down to psychology.
*  And for that reason, I I've said it so many times on the podcast.
*  I mean, I'm sick of myself saying it.
*  I see psychology and neuroscience as being like one thing.
*  And I know that that upsets people because it seems like there's more than
*  more of a divide than ever right now in the literature about
*  the differences between them.
*  And I don't see the problem.
*  I see I call all natural sciences
*  about the brain and mind neuroscience just because it's easier.
*  You know, it's like the lowest dimensional thing I can say.
*  But do you guys see that, you know, psychology and neuroscience as
*  as very divided?
*  Do you see neuroscience as just a confirmatory role for psychology, for instance?
*  No, it doesn't have to be.
*  But everybody has a right to use.
*  I think those are just the tool.
*  So expand that.
*  Yeah, expand on that, because that neuroscience is a tool.
*  That's interesting statement.
*  Yeah. So that is OK.
*  I am probably pissing somebody off.
*  And I'm sorry for that.
*  But I think this is my for the show.
*  Yeah, this is just my view and my how I
*  approaching to neuroscience.
*  Right. So my goal, my personal goal is to figure out how mine works.
*  Right. And to be more exact, I the reason why I do science,
*  I I'm interested in mind is my life is hard.
*  Right. I have to memorize a lot of things, but I can't do it even though I want to.
*  Why is that? That's the basis of my research.
*  Right. And part part of your research, I should say, is improving people's
*  cognitive skills like metacognition.
*  Like like mine, really. Right.
*  I just say I want to do it right.
*  But isn't that helpful for you guys, too?
*  Is that the way that I spin it? Right.
*  Because, you know, but yeah, it really is my my really selfish
*  motivation is to improve my my mental life.
*  Right. And you get to a point where a behavior can't really just say
*  whether one mechanism is correct or the other.
*  And in that case, I turn to neuroscience to provide independent.
*  Sometimes it's too much to say, maybe, but potentially unbiased.
*  Evidence to tell whether one hypothesis is correctly or the other.
*  That's why I say neuroscientists.
*  Neuroscience is a tool, at least for my approach.
*  But I know the other other side is true.
*  Some people are really interested in figuring out this new microcircuit.
*  Right. And it's not really it doesn't really matter for them
*  whether that is used for some mental mental faculty.
*  Yeah. Right. And that I appreciate that. Right.
*  But we can some people might care to merge the two together.
*  But everybody is right.
*  I think it's just a tool to to, you know, to achieve your goal.
*  You're not going to piss anyone off if you say everyone's right.
*  I don't I don't agree with that.
*  But in the in the same vein, psychology then is a tool.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Psychology can be a tool to show the importance
*  or how this new circuit might be impacting our life.
*  Right. And I'm totally fine with that.
*  I mean, it comes down to like, what's the what's the level of explanation?
*  That you're interested in.
*  And if it's if it's brains and cells, then then that's fine.
*  You know, you study that you can map it back on because we have psychology.
*  You can map it back to that. That's all useful.
*  But maybe that's just what you like to do.
*  That's what you're interested in explaining.
*  I came to this wanting to explain, you know, human behavior and thought
*  and why having small parts of your brain gone
*  lead to these profound deficits in your ability to function.
*  That's not something that single unit recordings will necessarily tell me.
*  I can develop a, you know, a big explanatory theory
*  about how this might work invoking neural mechanisms, and then I can go test them.
*  So I think to your point, K, about being a tool for me, I approached it that way.
*  But it is it is because I was really interested in attaching some, you know,
*  physical like I have a way to physically validate the things I've been saying
*  with words that map on to psychological and behavioral phenomena.
*  I mean, my so I I can see.
*  So the brain in itself is interesting.
*  And I think that anyone who's studying the brain for itself,
*  you know, more power to them.
*  I think that that's actually a very low percentage of people
*  who are interested in brains are actually interested in brains themselves.
*  I mean, my interest is in how brains and minds are connected, which still is
*  up in the air. I mean, it's still the very beginnings, it feels like, of of that question.
*  And I think that's what most people are interested in.
*  And if you're interested in that, then you have to span all levels.
*  And, you know, I'm not sure if the pluralism of explanatory,
*  you know, explanatory pluralism is what's needed.
*  I mean, I'm sure it is. But there's still a gap.
*  I mean, neuroscience still has a long way to go toward filling that gap.
*  And I'm not sure that psychology has as long a way to go because toward,
*  you know, the brain, I suppose, to a degree, a level.
*  I agree. The current psychological theories are not enough.
*  I bet it's it's not all correct.
*  It's not the neuroscience can't be just mapping
*  color coding the brain picture with the psychology theory pencils.
*  Right. It can be.
*  We all have to change the definition of those colors.
*  Some of the colors might be better.
*  Well, the red was actually the composition of.
*  I picked the wrong color.
*  Pink is the composition composition of red and blue or something like that.
*  Right. That will happen.
*  Or maybe we just maybe have to throw away some color pencil.
*  Right. That will happen.
*  And that's that's just the course of natural course of any science, I think.
*  But I feel like I feel like to your point, Paul, you know, these are
*  people that are developing curriculum for graduate neuroscience
*  and undergraduate neuroscience should be listening to these sorts of things
*  because I feel like a lot of people are in the same boat,
*  but it doesn't really translate to the kind of training that people get
*  pushed through and into.
*  And it, you know, yeah, absolutely.
*  The well-rounded individual is the person that makes these things work.
*  It's just there's not a lot of people aren't led to that.
*  I think I think the people like just listening to us talk, I think me and Kay
*  have sort of taken a similar trajectory in using these sorts of approaches
*  in the ways that we wanted to.
*  And I think ultimately, we know a lot more about things, at least in our own minds,
*  because we have this sort of multifaceted approach, but there is
*  it's almost the opposite.
*  You're trying to drive people from a pretty early point in time
*  to be pretty focused on really specific stuff that,
*  you know, outside of the sphere of that specific thing, it doesn't
*  it doesn't hold a lot of weight.
*  And you don't have the ability to synthesize all of this stuff.
*  Just knowing a lot more and having more breadth, you're just
*  you're able to synthesize it.
*  You ask better questions, you get better answers.
*  That's yeah, it's needed.
*  It's just not the way that the field goes.
*  And that's partially why I left academics.
*  One more Philip Sabies point that he made in industry.
*  What you want is a lot of people who have a really deep knowledge
*  about a very particular thing.
*  And then you want a broad diversity of those people who all have different
*  areas of that deep knowledge.
*  Whereas in academia, you kind of want people who can do a lot of different things,
*  you know, in an academic lab, let's say a lot of different things
*  at just not necessarily a surface level, but maybe not as deep
*  deeply as some expert in a particular topic.
*  Because in an academic lab, you're kind of limited with the amount
*  of team members that you have.
*  And so you all have to sort of reach beyond your expertise to if you want
*  to synthesize and move forward.
*  Does that make sense?
*  And does that does that ring true?
*  I think it depends on what and just it just depends in the pharmaceutical industry.
*  I think it's different because you so it's set up the same, right?
*  You have a matrix team and there is a specialist in something that is one
*  member of that team and they're supposed to do that thing.
*  But I mean, I can tell you, especially doing it's human science, you know
*  how much breadth you have to have.
*  Like as a neuroscientist, your end to end, you need to be able to plan
*  the experiment, you need to be able to build the rig, you need to be able
*  to do the surgeries, drop the electrodes, analyze the data and then publish
*  the results and talk about them.
*  That's a skill that you don't get a lot of places and it shows.
*  I mean, you work with people that are very like focused on one thing.
*  And the problem is you're in you're in an industry where, you know, if I was
*  focused on Parkinson's disease and that was all I really knew, well, we've
*  got 15 other diseases, some of them aren't even neuroscience disorder,
*  like neuroscientific questions that we would be asking.
*  How could I ever do that job if I didn't have some general heuristic
*  about how to do it, didn't wasn't able to synthesize diverse information?
*  I think if you're like, I don't know, maybe this is if you work in the
*  insurance industry, I don't know.
*  I think the closer you are to the life sciences in human research, it's closer
*  to what you'd want in like an academic lab than if you were out working somewhere
*  else where you are just given here's a chunk of work to do, complete this work.
*  And then somebody is going to build on it because it just doesn't work that way.
*  We're just planning really expensive experiments in the pharmaceutical
*  industry, really no different than the kinds of considerations we have put into
*  a cheap undergrad study in a lab.
*  But, but a lot more stakes involved, but the people just don't have this sort of
*  diverse experience planning, executing, analyzing, reporting studies.
*  And it's a huge problem.
*  I wish you guys would come work with me.
*  It would make my life so much easier.
*  I'm not working for the man.
*  I'll drink with the man.
*  I get that.
*  Well, you have a fair amount of independence if you want it.
*  Right.
*  But at the end of the day, they always, they always own you.
*  If, if Pfizer leaves neuroscience here, your, your big study gets killed.
*  They don't really care.
*  You know, years of people's work gets cut.
*  They, it's sort of cold, but you have to prepare for it.
*  And if you're prepared for it, then you have a fair amount of autonomy.
*  Yeah.
*  So how much autonomy do you have in deciding what question to go after?
*  Can you say, for example, when, when you wake up, you take a, you're in the shower
*  and come up with this beautiful idea that you have no, you're not an expert on at all.
*  And can you just run that experiment that day?
*  But you have to answer that question for yourself after Josh answers.
*  Oh, okay.
*  It's, I have a lot of freedom to operate within a, within a confined space.
*  So say, you know, I work on, I work on like 10 or 15 different programs that span
*  different disease areas and in within those broad confines, the problems that
*  I'm trying to address, the data I'm trying to collect, the experiments we're trying to run.
*  I have probably as much control as I had in an academic lab because I'm, I'm the
*  expert on that's my job is to plan those studies.
*  So it's, it's all the same.
*  The difference being that, you know, when I was working in a, in a academic lab, I
*  could read a social psychology paper that was interesting to me.
*  And as a little side gig, run a couple of experiments because I thought it was a
*  cool thing to do that goes away.
*  In humans.
*  In humans.
*  Yeah.
*  Not in monkeys.
*  Well, no, you need to know coming into the monkeys that you're going to be
*  committing five years to answering one question, but that question will be, it
*  will be beat to death for 15 years with the data you collected.
*  I've been publishing as many monkey papers since I left academics
*  as when I was in more.
*  That's interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Can you answer that same question?
*  How much I have a feeling that you're going to say that you feel vast amounts
*  of freedom with your shower thoughts and applying them.
*  I do.
*  So I, well, still, you know, I wouldn't say the perfect freedom, but I have a
*  way to make it happen.
*  I can still approach.
*  I have a hope to make that shower thought into a real experiments.
*  Well, it's all piloting.
*  You can pilot, right?
*  That's right.
*  That's the key.
*  Exactly.
*  I can pilot it.
*  And that's, that's how, what, what I decided to come back to human research is
*  just that I can actually pilot the experiments really quickly and see what,
*  if that's the way that I want to go, that's how I like to fish as well.
*  I try out different rigs and see what works and then go with that.
*  Right.
*  I, I'm not smart enough to figure out the best shot in the first try.
*  So I like to keep a couple of lines in the water and figure things out.
*  And being able to do that is why I love this job.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that, that's one of the reasons why, one of the reasons why I left
*  academia is I could not foresee having the freedom because I was monkey
*  neurophysiology guy, not psychology guy, not piloting human studies guy.
*  That was my skillset.
*  And so my faculty position would be in monkey neurophysiology.
*  And I did not foresee a situation where I could exercise the freedom to manifest
*  what I came up with in the shower.
*  Right.
*  So, so I think that's key probably to your, one of the keys to your happiness,
*  in academia is that that freedom perhaps.
*  Exactly.
*  That's exactly it.
*  And yeah.
*  And then there, you know, that's not the only, the academia is not just
*  for these kinds of people, right?
*  You know, there are people who are, who are having successful labs, doing just
*  one thing and making a really, really deep, insightful experiments onto these
*  one small things, and that's a really good success model.
*  It just depends on who you are and where you find the niche, you know, whether
*  you find the niche to do it.
*  And for me, Paul is right.
*  I wanted to cast a wider net.
*  And that's how I like to do science.
*  I'm interested, I get interested in many things and I want to get going with
*  ideally all of the things that I got, that got me interested.
*  So human work was being able to do, exercise that freedom was the, was the
*  reason why I decided to stick in academia.
*  Paul, I, like you, I felt like I wasn't going to lose that freedom one way or
*  another at some point.
*  I mean, I just remember simultaneously, I was interviewing for academic jobs
*  and in industry jobs and the academic jobs.
*  I mean, I felt like a bit of a curiosity because I did multiple things.
*  They, they couldn't, they couldn't figure out like, what are you going to do here?
*  It was like, we brought you in for an interview and this is all awesome, but we,
*  we want you to set up an EEG lab and like do these specific things that you've
*  been doing.
*  And to be honest with you, at that point, I was independently working on doing
*  some of this like digital stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  We call digital and, and that's, I was getting grants funded like SBIRs and
*  STTRs working with, with companies doing this stuff.
*  And I knew that's where the, the things were going to go.
*  That's where my money should be coming from.
*  That's I could use that to fund my EEG lab, but there just wasn't the, the
*  appetite to, to have that kind of like utility player on the faculty when you
*  have one faculty role and you need somebody to take these two boots that got
*  put in that nobody is using for EEG work.
*  I mean, it's just those sort of practicalities.
*  And I saw my, my freedom sort of fading away.
*  I think I would have, it would have been in the same place.
*  I would have had some freedom, but there would have been some constraints around
*  it and I wouldn't have felt as free as I wanted to.
*  So I think ultimately I made the right choice, but it sounds like, Kay, it
*  works out maybe a little bit better for you.
*  You sound like you're in a good spot.
*  I just wasn't, I was 50 50 whether I'd have that.
*  So I, I bail.
*  Well, I mean, Kay's also, you know, productive, which helps, but you know,
*  when you're productive, you can, you can, I think, you know, spread your tendrils
*  out, spread your tendrils, tentacles, spread your tentacles out, you know,
*  tendrils too, right?
*  I mean, tendrils too.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Octopi are just, it was like the vegetarian version of the, that's right.
*  For decades, you know, before a few years ago, it was a single electrode
*  recording a single neuron or maybe two, if you're near another neuron, close
*  enough to record it and then all of a sudden you started getting tetrodes and
*  then, and then multi-contact electrodes.
*  And now it's up into the, you know, thousands, you know, hundreds, you
*  know, with Utah rays and stuff and monkeys anyway, and then you can go beyond
*  that with, with calcium imaging and things like that in mice and rodents.
*  Is this a turning point in, in neuroscience?
*  Are we at the, are we at a juncture right now?
*  Do you see, are we at the L of the, our level of understanding?
*  Um, you know, did we, were we just, Josh, were you and I just the tiny,
*  tiniest bit too early in academia to reap those benefits?
*  Oh man.
*  I feel like that, that all happened.
*  Like I always wished that I was like, you know, early 1900s.
*  Of course.
*  All these, these little ideas that you have that are so impactful, but people
*  hadn't thought about them yet.
*  It's like a huge, huge advance to think that and then prove it out through
*  experiments and, and now we're like, you know, we're, we're focused on the
*  most minute little questions, just trying to like chip away a little bit at them.
*  I wish, I kind of feel like it's the opposite of, of, of that.
*  I mean, I feel like we know a lot.
*  There's some little gaps.
*  Those gaps are, you're like an asymptote, right?
*  So a little bit of movement is not going to be that much movement, but it could
*  push you over a little bit to really understand stuff, but I feel like a
*  lot of that ends up being like methodological and not so much theoretical.
*  Got a lot of theories we can start testing if the methods catch up.
*  And I feel kind of like that's what's been happening with, with optogenetics
*  and stuff, it's just, it gives you a way to verify stuff that you already thought
*  was happening and control those things better.
*  And I think that's useful because it verifies things, but I feel like the
*  excitement of being a 1908 scientists, you know, William James, I could have
*  written a book that was, was, would pop psychology by today's standards, but it's,
*  it is the foundation of most of our thinking that I just wish, you know, if I,
*  if it was, if it was like a real life, real life Bill and Ted's, I would take the,
*  I would take the telephone boot time machine back to the early 1900s and be
*  a neuroscientist.
*  You know, not all my listeners are as old as you are and probably don't know
*  what that reference was in the bill and Ted's.
*  I can't believe you brought it up.
*  Well, I'll have you know, there was a new bill and Ted's that came out last year.
*  So I didn't realize it came out.
*  Oh, it came out.
*  I was on the hot seat.
*  I was hoping it'd come out.
*  And then I guess it passed me by, but Kay, what do you, do you agree with that?
*  I don't know to me, just data alone is not going to solve the problem.
*  I don't think right.
*  So the neural net deep learning type of stuff, I think that's cool.
*  But for me, I am not using your, your deep learning or anything as a tool.
*  So the deep learning revolution has not affected your lab or your research at all.
*  Not, not in a day to day operation.
*  No, or not even I think in coming up with a new experiments.
*  No.
*  Right.
*  The reason why he hasn't impacted me is that I am the bottleneck for me to
*  understand is to, I don't think I will be able to understand what it's offering.
*  I think it'll be a useful simulation device.
*  Okay.
*  This does what brain seems to do.
*  So this must be right is at least that's my naive understanding of what deep
*  learning it has to offer, but you know, the true me, what understanding means is
*  to actually be able to, to separate out all the processes into, uh, dissociable
*  things and then make manipulation onto them to make a predictable outcome.
*  And is creating convoluted network helped me do that?
*  I not there.
*  I'm not convinced that I will be able to use it.
*  Well, I mean, there, there are kind of two ways that the deep learning, quote
*  revolution, um, is in influential in neuroscience.
*  One is, you know, at attempts for theory of the brain and for using, um, neural
*  networks as models of the brain, and then comparing them to brains and, and
*  behavior and output, but the other is just as a tool to, to categorize, you
*  know, things like, um, where I could see, you know, in EEG using the data to
*  categorize, did they see a rabbit or did they see a squirrel, right?
*  Right.
*  Based on the EEG data that could be useful in that respect.
*  Yes.
*  So I do that using the machine learning type of, you know, we provide the
*  feedback, not the deep learning way.
*  And that makes sense to me, but going beyond to deep learning to accept some
*  unknown black box in there, I don't know if that's getting me closer to actually
*  get the, what the understanding that I want, I am not there yet is what I'm saying.
*  Well, so this is good because I was gonna, I was about to switch, you know,
*  to bring in AI, because this is ostensibly a podcast about the interface
*  between neuroscience and AI.
*  Um, and sometimes that's just, you know, window dressing, I suppose, but, you
*  know, we never, I don't know that we ever sat around and talked about AI and the
*  deep learning revolution, let's say kicked off in 2012, right.
*  And when did we leave lab?
*  So just have 14 to 17.
*  Yeah.
*  Six 2016, something like that.
*  So that had already happened, but we never had conversations about it.
*  And I, it wasn't on my radar.
*  Was it on either of your radars like that, the whole AI side of things?
*  I mean, it was, but I, it wasn't, I mean,
*  it kind of, I mean, I knew it existed.
*  I didn't see the utility in it for my day to day.
*  And there weren't as interesting.
*  I mean, it was like the beginning of interesting things coming out of it.
*  So I think, I think for me, I just chose to ignore it because it didn't have
*  relevance now I can't avoid it.
*  It's like a huge, like it's just like a, it's a buzz term and, and what people
*  don't know, like they don't understand that just like everything else, it's,
*  it's a tool that you can use.
*  It has utility in very specific settings and other settings.
*  It is not useful in any way can lead you in the wrong direction.
*  And, but everybody wants to do it because they hear it.
*  And it ends up causing huge problems.
*  I mean, when you're developing novel measures of behavior and you're, you're
*  sort of mining the data using a deep neural net to tell you, look, there's 20
*  little features of this that helped me differentiate somebody with Parkinson's
*  from a healthy comparison.
*  I don't care if there are 20 little features that differentiate them.
*  I need to know what it's doing so that I can say that, that some aspect of their
*  function is improved and deep learning does not get you there, but I think most
*  people don't realize it.
*  And so they just, you they'll, they'll apply that to large data sets collected
*  in their clinical trials, not understanding that it's not going to tell you the
*  level of explanation that you actually want to get out of.
*  Well, I mean, there's a big push for explainable AI these days, I suppose.
*  That's, that's a different thing.
*  I mean, that's, that's like kind of pushing against all of this, right?
*  You almost have to use some version of artificial intelligence and machine
*  learning to build the models that you use to classify events out in the world.
*  So you're continuously recording somebody walking around.
*  You have to be able to do that, but those are explainable pieces of AI where you've
*  built them with a purpose.
*  They can be built based on your understanding of biomechanics and, and, you
*  know, you could tell somebody from raw signal to the output, what was going on.
*  That's what you need to be able to do because those levels of explanation in
*  between are what tell you like this behavior that I saw maps to this thing
*  that's actually happening in a patient's brain.
*  Well, that's one reason why I think that deep, well, I'll say deep learning has a
*  lot of promise for helping understand brains is because you can develop theories
*  and test them pretty quickly in a deep, you know, neural network where, whereas
*  you, you, and you have knowledge of all the weights, every time step you can, if
*  you wanted to, you could read out anything, all the parameters that you
*  wanted.
*  And so you can really test your theories and, you know, AI moves its little circle
*  of completion happens so quickly relative to neuroscience, which is, you
*  know, even though K you go fast and you can go fast because you're in, in EEG lab
*  still neuroscience is slow relative to building a model, running it, testing it,
*  having a theory.
*  Assuming that it is the correct model.
*  Well, yeah.
*  So, so the next, next people I'm going to have on the podcast are Omri
*  Barack and David Cicillo, and they work on recurrent neural networks and trying to
*  understand them using dynamical systems theory to understand what's going on in
*  recurrent neural networks.
*  And that seems a really promising route to me to understand, you know, at the
*  population level and in some way that we haven't penetrated yet or haven't, we
*  haven't asked the right questions yet.
*  And I feel like the right questions will come at least will be helped by studying
*  these neural networks.
*  And you guys don't see that as a, as a route to understanding brains?
*  I think it is a route and I can be a route, but it's not mine.
*  So me, maybe this, again, this is just me, right?
*  The reason why I do science is because I want to understand.
*  Right.
*  That that's what I want to do.
*  It's very selfish, right?
*  And I can't, at this, with my level of knowledge, right.
*  And expertise, I don't know if I'll be able to understand the simulation
*  that you're in.
*  Well, I agree with Josh that it provides utility, right?
*  It can tell you what's important, right?
*  But everything that happens in the deep newer convoluted neural net is a mystery
*  still.
*  And does that help me provide descriptive terms as to what processes have taken
*  place?
*  I don't know if I have that, that labels for them and it does not going to help.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I, I, I've just, I've probably had this conversation with you, Paul,
*  because you, you've been a modeler as long as I've known you.
*  Like I, I never, I never understood why you would model something that you could
*  just test.
*  I mean, this is going to piss people off because this I've had this conversation
*  with modelers many, many times, but, but I'm not, I'm not taking anything away
*  from modeling.
*  I mean, maybe it's precisely because you can do that.
*  It's powerful, but, but at the same time, I mean, the thought model that would
*  lead you to set up a neural net in a certain way could be the same thought model
*  you use to plan a series of experiments.
*  And the experiments have the benefit of being something that's empirically tested.
*  It's derived from the humans that you're trying to study.
*  That's, that's, I think to me, if I was going to put my time somewhere, the reason
*  why I've typically neglected modeling, despite being exposed to it a lot is
*  because I'd rather just run the experiment.
*  There's lots to say there.
*  One thing is that with modeling, so you have a mechanistic theory, right?
*  of how this might be, how, how the neurons might be interacting and how their
*  activity leads to a certain behavior.
*  And you can build all of the parts into the model, right?
*  But then to test all of the parts in the brain, that's a ton of work, right?
*  So if you can build the model with a few assumptions and only do like two
*  experiments in the brain, one or two experiments of the brain that will
*  confirm that model's likelihood of being correct, that's where the utility
*  of modeling is, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm coming at it from more of a behavioral science standpoint where
*  that's not really an option and a lot of, a lot of like, you know, contemporary
*  modeling started there.
*  And so for me, I mean, that's sort of where-
*  Cognitive modeling, like box and arrow.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  So, I mean, yeah, I don't know.
*  I will just always be the experimentalist and you can always be the modeler.
*  I'm not a modeling person.
*  You probably aren't either after spending so much time pouring
*  over your models in the lab.
*  Oh my God.
*  When's the last time you guys coded in MATLAB?
*  For Kay, it was probably today.
*  Today.
*  Yup.
*  You're right.
*  Josh, you're right.
*  I left MATLAB.
*  I'm all Python.
*  I still do a significant amount of data science work, but it's, it's going back
*  to the point I made earlier, there just aren't people there that have the, the
*  right skillset to do it.
*  And so I get stuck having to do it and I had to pick up new technique.
*  I mean, it's just like being in the lab.
*  It was like starting another postdoc.
*  Yeah.
*  Just to get us back on track.
*  Sorry for that aside, but I mean, yeah, my modeling, of course, I had to pour
*  over the code because that's mostly because I was a terrible coder and, you
*  know, you used piece together other people's code and then wrote my own
*  terrible code and then, you know, you'd find errors and it's just awful.
*  You know, and that took almost as long as monkey experiments, but I, I'm not a,
*  I'm an experimentalist by trade.
*  I came to modeling when I was in, you know, graduate school and, and
*  eventually as a postdoc, that's when modeling became necessary.
*  Like you couldn't publish a paper almost unless you had a model to go along with
*  your data and that's when that started to happen.
*  And, and, um, I mean, just, you know, the, the more data points that you had, the
*  more ways to approach the question that converge the stronger the, uh, answer to
*  the hypothesis is, so I mean, I know you hate modeling.
*  Well, it's, it's easy for me to say that I hate modeling because I don't have to
*  do it and I can run the experiments and I can point to a model that confirms it
*  without having to do it myself.
*  I mean, that's, that's sort of how I feel about, uh, uh, Yuri's view of, of
*  the brain being everything it's, it's sort of like, yeah, it's easy to say.
*  Now with a hundred years of hindsight of terminology and, and, you know, he, his
*  mental heuristic, as much as he might not like to admit it is based probably on
*  those things, but he does admit that.
*  So this is, I, I, okay.
*  So yes, I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have brought it up.
*  I, it's been clarified multiple times now, but then, then, then what's the point
*  of this whole thing, multiple papers, but you know, now we're just going to kind of
*  walk it back and be cordial.
*  That's I'm just so happy to not be in, in academics anymore for this, this basic.
*  You've misinterpreted my very strong stance.
*  I wrote here, let me walk it back to be a little bit closer to reality.
*  And then at the end of it, it's like, yeah, cool.
*  We're not so different after all.
*  Well, he, he's actually, uh, genuinely apologetic about it because, uh, he
*  realizes he didn't communicate the idea, you know, correctly, uh, and, or maybe
*  he just neglected to communicate what he maybe thought, you know, people
*  would assume or something, but I think without that strong stance, it
*  doesn't have as much impact.
*  I mean, that's certainly got attention.
*  That's, you know, what's, what's the point at that point?
*  Like, okay, cool.
*  So now you're just like all of us.
*  Josh is referring to your abuse.
*  Aki's view that we should, that, that neuroscience hasn't had, um, it's
*  fair share, um, in among the sciences in generating its own vocabulary and
*  conceptual concepts, um, based, based on the data that you record from the brain.
*  Right.
*  So, uh, and, and that we have in neuroscience, neuroscience has imported
*  all of its vocabulary and concepts from psychology, which I believe is correct.
*  But whether that is, um, erroneous to do is that's the question.
*  And Kay says, no, that's not a road.
*  So now we're reviewing the, uh, Yuri, no, which is great.
*  That's fine.
*  This is psychology versus neuroscience.
*  And I wanted to talk about this.
*  So, so Kay, what were you going to, what were you going to say?
*  Well, you got to start from somewhere.
*  Everyone agrees on that.
*  Yep.
*  And, uh, psychology with something that's available and that's something
*  that people wanted to figure out then.
*  And I think there are a lot of people still want to figure out psychology
*  based on neuroscience or why not use it.
*  But that doesn't mean that that is the right, that's not,
*  that's not necessarily the Bible.
*  I agree with Yuri's point that it doesn't have to be always correct.
*  And I see the frustration, right?
*  So psychology thing, terminology that's introduced in psychology, it's really,
*  really elusive and sometimes cryptic.
*  And that can be that sometimes it's really frustrating to boil it down into more
*  understandable, more measurable neural activities, right?
*  And I see the frustration, but there's no point in making them, you know, making
*  a hostile stance against each other.
*  Right.
*  I think we are going to the same place.
*  It is fun.
*  No, I, I love, you know, I really love the debate.
*  And Dr.
*  Pappos point that, you know, that we are baffled by the young people being
*  offended, you know, being offended by people having arguments or discussion about it.
*  No, I, I love discussion and that's something I bring up in the lab meeting
*  all the time, we talk shit about each other, but we do it for fun.
*  And that's how science moves forward.
*  Right.
*  So I think there's no, that's the right way to do it.
*  We just bring up, sometimes you make a really strong point just to make, for
*  the sake of making points in by discussing, arguing about it, things get better.
*  But I think we both are on the same point.
*  We have to start from somewhere in psychology had a lot of stacked history on it.
*  So it's makes sense to start from there because that's something that we want to
*  figure out, but that doesn't mean that it's all, it's all right.
*  Well, let's go down the vocabulary and concept path.
*  So question number one is, do you think that let's say Yuri, we're
*  going to pin it on Yuri Buzaki.
*  Do you think that he has a point that neuroscience hasn't had a proper, had
*  its proper day in defining its own terms and concepts and, and having its own
*  body of terms, I guess, like, but why would you want that?
*  That's, that's the, that's because the, because that's, that's how you think of,
*  that's how you move forward theoretically as well.
*  Right.
*  It's, it's one potential way.
*  So one example, especially from him, and maybe, I don't know if this is what
*  drove him to think this way is oscillations, right?
*  Cause he's a neural oscillations guy.
*  And you would never have, from a psychology standpoint, talk about
*  oscillations and for that to be anything.
*  I don't believe, right?
*  You have to record from brains and look at the properties and, and
*  realize it's oscillating.
*  And then you can think, well, what would that do in the brain?
*  Like on, you know, on the upswing, it could fire that on the downswing,
*  it would be inhibited, et cetera.
*  And so from that sort of thing, those sorts of findings, then you
*  start to build a vocabulary and, you know.
*  It should just be a supplement on modern psychological theory.
*  I mean, it's, it's a supplement to it.
*  Like Yael's paper is a good, is a good way to lay this out.
*  It sort of supersedes all of this stuff.
*  There are interesting behaviors that we want to understand in the world.
*  Those are the primary thing that we're trying to describe.
*  We may get some nice little tidbits from neuroscience, but the whole,
*  everything has shifted, the funding structure has shifted.
*  The people's interest has shifted to these sort of neuroscientific
*  details that only usually recapitulate things we already knew based on
*  behavior and are better described by years of behavioral research.
*  I get the funding push.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, but to your point, there are, there are things that you can, I mean,
*  obviously psychology doesn't predict mitochondria and it just doesn't, it
*  doesn't care about the cells and the components of cells.
*  But mitochondria don't predict behaviors as well.
*  Yeah.
*  Who knows?
*  Maybe they do.
*  If they do, do I care?
*  I don't know if I could use mitochondrial recordings as a way to explain why
*  people, you know, forget what they were supposed to get at the grocery store.
*  Then maybe I would care about it.
*  But I think it comes back to the level of explanation that an
*  individual is interested in.
*  And if, if your level of explanation is, is the brain and you want to be able
*  to describe those things that you see in some, some way that isn't tainted by
*  this, this other stuff, the mind, then that's fine.
*  But, but I feel like the starting point is we're humans.
*  We observe and act in behaviors and we want to explain those things.
*  And so it's always got to be tied to that, whether the concepts are correct
*  or the words we use are correct.
*  Probably arguable, but I mean, there's no basis for really caring about what
*  happens in the brain necessarily from, from a, like it just depends.
*  If I'm developing drugs, I can focus on cells and that's going to get me where I
*  need to go to develop the treatment.
*  But how do I know if that treatment is working?
*  How do I know if the patient is benefiting from it?
*  That flips all the way to the other side of like introspective psychology, giving
*  a person a patient reported outcome to describe like abstract concepts that they
*  have no real ability to understand or describe in many cases.
*  And then you trying to map that onto whether that brain change is changing
*  their functional daily lives.
*  That's, I think to me, it's hard to reconcile.
*  Why, why would you want to dig so far into the details?
*  It's almost a different discipline at that point.
*  If it's not in service of trying to tie it on to, to theories about behavior and
*  mind, well, I like that you separated behavior and mind there because
*  behavior is great and very interesting.
*  I'm more interested and I, and maybe it it's kind of in the same, maybe they're,
*  they're the same thing ultimately, but I'm interested in thought, you know, and
*  I actually, I kind of think that thought is a behavior, but, but, but it's not a
*  measurable behavior.
*  Yeah.
*  Why I have often said in the last few years, I realized like, I have the luxury
*  of, of for the first time in my life, being a behaviorist because I don't care.
*  And that's, you know, you know how the drug works ostensibly, you know, you
*  have animal models, right?
*  So you understand it's doing something to the brain, but if you're developing
*  something that's targeting pathology, it's not like you're doing circuit
*  systems level neuroscience.
*  It's like this stuff exists in the brain.
*  We're going to bathe the brain in this.
*  We're going to bind it up and we're going to cause that stuff to go away
*  instead of killing neurons.
*  And then all I need to be able to do is say, okay, the behavioral manifestations
*  of this disease are like X, Y, and Z.
*  And if I have a good way to measure those three behaviors, then I am a hundred
*  percent golden and we're going to be able to measure the effects of the drug.
*  And we move forward with things.
*  Yeah.
*  For the first time in my life, I just focus on behavior and it's kind of
*  freeing because I can kind of ignore all of this stuff for once.
*  Ignore the hard stuff.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  But that goes back to your wanting to do things that are good and practical and
*  have, you know, clear outcomes and, uh, you know, helping that actually helping
*  the world, whereas I don't care about helping the world.
*  Like I'm, I'm like, Hey, I'm very selfish and just want to understand for whatever
*  reason, you know, cause I'm selfish.
*  But this goes back to the point that I made earlier.
*  It's, it's whatever the individual's interests or, or evidence requirements are.
*  And that's sort of the fundamental.
*  Of course you're going to have people that are completely swinging on both
*  sides because their focus and interest is in a completely different place.
*  It's like to somebody like, like maybe us that, that wants to
*  synthesize all of this stuff.
*  It's super frustrating because you know, you realize the importance of all of
*  those things and in what to bring all of them to bear on one another.
*  But not everybody thinks that way.
*  And some people's interest really is at a different level than somebody else's.
*  And I think a lot of that contributes to the, this is sort of back and forth.
*  Probably so there's a lot of wrong people out there.
*  I'm not one of them, but you know, there are a lot of wrong people out there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Do you have something to add before I move, before I ask a second question?
*  I think the answer, the really again, cliche answer is it depends again, if you
*  want to figure out the new implementation, then you should come up with a language.
*  But if there's a language set that you want to base off, and if that's what you
*  care about is to figure out mind and why don't we use some established language
*  that's used for mine, right?
*  But that doesn't, that's just a starting point.
*  Nobody's stopping anybody from coming up with their own independent work.
*  And if that proves, you know, if that becomes useful, then people will use it.
*  Right.
*  And one thing I will say is that, well, from the psychological standpoint, right.
*  Oscillation, I think it might be tricky to say, say alpha is alpha
*  oscillation is this theta oscillation is that right.
*  Those are just the vehicle of the information transfer from one place to the other.
*  Alpha is, you know, internally directed cognition, whereas beta is movement or
*  something like that.
*  Yep.
*  I think that is, that is, I think people are doing that to, for explanatory purposes.
*  I don't, I don't think anybody's trying to figure out one term that directly, that
*  corresponds one to one, but there are people, I was like that when I was, when I
*  started reading, reading, you know, these oscillation thing, when I started doing it,
*  I was confused and I was like, okay, I'm not going to go there.
*  I'm going to figure out my own way.
*  Right.
*  That's that.
*  That's to, for my sanity.
*  Right.
*  So trying to, trying to force this one-on-one relationship may not be the right way to
*  do it.
*  Maybe something that, you know, highway, there's a highway on the map, but it's
*  not highway is not a, you can't define a highway for one function, right.
*  It is just there.
*  People use that highway for many reasons.
*  I think as a, as a science, we're pretty far along that road already that there
*  isn't a one-to-one mapping.
*  And well, but sometimes people try, sometimes people, when people have to
*  describe this new, this newer part does this, this network does this, people get
*  caught up in that one-on-one relationship.
*  Still.
*  Well, you have to, well, I mean, part of the problem is you have to use words.
*  And so I guess that brings me to my, you know, the second question is are words
*  enough, is language the right vehicle, the right tool to use to even think about
*  these things?
*  I mean, eventually we have to use language, but is it limiting us because,
*  you know, on the one hand, language is the most wonderful thing in the universe
*  that it separates us from the rest of these inferior creatures.
*  And it is the most, you know, that allows us to abstract ideas and combine them.
*  But when you abstract, you actually lose a lot of detail.
*  And, and in the case of language and communicating with each other, we're all
*  perfect communicators, so it doesn't apply to us, but sometimes people are
*  imperfect communicators and misunderstand each other.
*  And so language is not a perfect tool, you know, to communicate.
*  And so is it even relevant to use language to try to understand brains and minds
*  and the connection between them?
*  Maybe not, but you know, if you have to still communicate, then language is the
*  only tool that we have.
*  So we have to still use it.
*  People can, there are people who have excellent skill in one thing, but they
*  have difficult time communicating it.
*  Right.
*  But that doesn't mean that person who would suck up communicating, it doesn't
*  mean that they don't have a perfect answer for a problem that you're asking.
*  Right.
*  So the language, I think the barrier there is a communication, not
*  necessarily to understand.
*  What do you think, Josh?
*  I feel like if you get your funding from the NIH, then yes, yes, you absolutely
*  have to use words because words are tied to people's health.
*  I mean, I'm saying all of this stuff because it was more salient to me than
*  it ever was before.
*  Like I worked in labs where we were testing patients and all of this stuff.
*  That's a lot different than being on the other side and developing treatments and
*  the sort of evidentiary requirements for saying that something actually works.
*  You it's, it's descriptive.
*  I mean, you have a array of people out there that have to describe how they
*  think and feel, and that was, that was for a long time, the state of things.
*  I mean, it still is very important evidence.
*  The work that I do is trying to apply some, some more objective approaches to
*  collecting supportive information along those lines.
*  And at the end of the day, the things that I'm trying to measure need to map
*  to the concepts that people can explain to like describe their current state.
*  So I think it just, it all depends on what the end goal is.
*  The sadists in academic science that have to deal, I mean, that's, that's the
*  work product.
*  You have to describe things.
*  You describe it for people so that they can use it in their own work.
*  I can use it in my drug development work.
*  It's, it's a hard thing for all of the, this we're flip-flopping back and forth
*  over all of this stuff, because it is, it's, it's very difficult, but it just
*  depends on what the end goal is.
*  What, what are you trying to use the information for?
*  If you don't have good descriptive terms that the average person can understand
*  and convey on their own, you can't provide good healthcare.
*  You can't develop drugs that you know are actually doing something to impact the
*  person.
*  And so I, for me, I have to be able to tie onto concepts that people understand
*  and the terms that we use and use in psychology came out of just people
*  understanding that these are things that are descriptive and understanding what my
*  internal state is and we're continuing to use them, but now supplementing them
*  with objective measures.
*  What's the alternative Paul?
*  Well, I mean, mathematical, you know, I don't know pictures, math, things like
*  that, but I mean, what I just feel like that we, or at least personally, I don't
*  understand a lot of things when people say stuff like you guys are talking, I
*  have no idea what you're really talking about and pretending I do, you know, but
*  at least, you know, it, you know, what you say goes into my ears and then
*  something happens in my brain and then it can land in some sort of fashion that I
*  can carry on.
*  Right.
*  But beyond that, I really don't know that what we're talking about is the same
*  thing.
*  And I think that language is a, a necessary thing, but maybe a bear, maybe
*  not the best mode of understanding.
*  It's the best mode of communication that we have, but it might not be the best
*  mode of understanding.
*  You know, I'm getting us on the deep end here.
*  You guys, do you guys think about AI much?
*  I do, because it's a, it's, it's directly applicable to, to my work.
*  I mean, you're, you're sending people out with, with sensors and it's just a
*  constant spew of information.
*  Being able to recognize behaviors occurring from it would be like continuous
*  EEG, that continuous EEG is only good if you epoch it in some way.
*  How do you epoch continuous data where you have no reference, there are no
*  flags, there's nothing to do it.
*  There, you have to build classifiers that will detect events that look like what
*  you're looking for and it will pull them out of the data so you can make sense of
*  it.
*  So to that, like in that respect, I use it every day.
*  It is the most important thing from a continuous data.
*  Does the, does the concept of human level AI mean anything to you?
*  Okay.
*  You go ahead.
*  You, you, you go ahead.
*  Uh, I think it's, it has a value as a simulator simulator.
*  Well, do we, is it something to be desired?
*  Do we want human level AI?
*  For scientific purpose, maybe, right?
*  We can, we can push the limit of ethics if we have, uh,
*  but that's not why people want human level AI.
*  People want human level AI.
*  Why do we, why don't we go for superhuman AI?
*  Why do we limit ourselves?
*  Why don't we go for superhuman?
*  Well, that's, that's the question, right?
*  Uh, you know, is, is human level AI artificial general intelligence or are
*  they different things?
*  To me, it's a fool's game to build human level AI.
*  If that's, if what you're wanting is the AI to be good at something, why would
*  you want to build something like that?
*  I agree.
*  So imperfect.
*  I totally agree with you, Paul.
*  I think the human level AI is only useful in the sense that it's a sim, it's a
*  simulator for human cognition and behavior.
*  If you want to figure out human, I think there's a, there's a merit in
*  creating a human level AI, but if you want to get the better functions for
*  whatever that you want to do, I think we should go for superhuman and some of
*  the things that's already developed is going beyond human capabilities.
*  So, right.
*  I think a lot of the AI that's, that's been developed has.
*  Yep.
*  Really shone a light on how poor we are at many things rather than how great we
*  are.
*  What do you think, Josh?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I wouldn't want to make human level AI.
*  I actually, it'll become increasingly easy just because, you know, the
*  decrement of society's mental function is going pretty quickly down.
*  So I feel like, you know, the AI from the early eighties will be enough to, to
*  achieve that, but I mean, I think it just depends, it just depends on what, what
*  the goal is.
*  If you want to be able to do things better than a human or, or, I mean, think
*  about like perceptual problems.
*  That's not something that requires like high level thinking, but it is like a
*  really difficult computational problem.
*  I mean, the reason why current AI like, like contemporary AI was based on image
*  processing is because those are hard problems to solve.
*  They require classification.
*  It's something we were able to build that we could do kind of like the human brain.
*  I couldn't imagine something that, that, so it's good at finding patterns, right?
*  But whether it could replicate sort of flexible thinking in the way that we
*  usually experience it or problem solving in the way that we experience it, I don't
*  think that that's desirable or something that we'll really ever get to, but that's
*  just me.
*  I'm telling you though, when, when history looks back on this little era of, of
*  neuroscience and, and, you know, whatever, how many, however many years into the
*  future, neuroscience is going to look like a really well run Institute, you
*  know, research, a gent research path, because it's going to look like really fast.
*  We figured it out.
*  We figured out what that we, what we were doing was wrong over and over and over
*  much faster than other academic pursuits figured out what they were doing wrong
*  over and over and over.
*  I believe, I mean, it feels like we're in this like messed up era because
*  everyone's very critical about how neuroscience is going and how to
*  understand minds and brains.
*  But looking back, it's really fast.
*  I believe it's exciting.
*  Yeah, that is exciting.
*  It was fast because it's, it's just, you know, standing on the shoulders of
*  giants as well and cursing the cursing, the giant that you're standing on.
*  That's happening as well.
*  Well, yeah, that's right.
*  The precedence of physiology as a discipline has existed for a long time.
*  The brain was less tractable because it was a glom of stuff that was harder to
*  understand.
*  It was more complex.
*  It's, it's just, it lagged behind, but a lot of the principles underlying are
*  ability to measure those things and understand them are based on, you know,
*  centuries worth of other physiology that was easier to explain building tools
*  that we can now use to describe this other organ that is a lot more complex.
*  So, I mean, it's, it's kind of like, I mean, even in the pharmaceutical
*  industry, it's the same thing.
*  Neuroscience is an undesirable place to be because it's hard.
*  It is like the promised land.
*  There are so many things, you know, as a neurologist, it's got to be the most
*  crippling feeling when somebody walks in because for 90% of the things you have
*  wrong with your brain, they have nothing they can do for it.
*  They give you a little bit of an assessment.
*  They may be able to accurately diagnose you, but there is no treatment for any
*  of those things.
*  Maybe there's a symptomatic, but nothing is going to cure the disease.
*  And so it's, it's like kind of a crippling place to be.
*  It was like, what you're saying is going to also apply to treatments for
*  neuroscience.
*  Pfizer leaves neuroscience in 2017 and by 2025, we're like, you know, we have
*  pretty good cures or things that slow disease progression for Alzheimer's, ALS,
*  all of this stuff that seemed intractable.
*  So it will seem fast, but it's because all this other failure and methods
*  development can now be applied to this.
*  We can do it better.
*  I'm going to go 2030 at least, but so you're being optimistic because I
*  well, from a treatment standpoint, I feel pretty good because I'm at companies.
*  I've been at companies that had, I mean, I will tell you there, there will be a
*  cure for at least a certain type of ALS that will come out in the next couple
*  of years.
*  I mean, that will help at least with a P value less than 0.05.
*  This is the other thing, right?
*  I mean, you're, we knew how to make pills and pills don't always get into the
*  brain.
*  And, and so you kind of do all types of crazy stuff to get them to work.
*  Well, it's not just pills anymore.
*  There's antibodies, then there's genetic treatments.
*  I mean, it's just all of this stuff that we couldn't use to be able to do is going
*  to make us be able, it doesn't matter anymore.
*  It's not going to be some little like small effect, like did it work?
*  Didn't it work?
*  You're going in, you're actually altering mRNA or you're going in and you're
*  replacing cells.
*  And those are things that are, they have huge effects.
*  I mean, the disease goes away.
*  And, and so like for me, my job will no longer exist.
*  I I'm there to get better measures, but at the end of the day, if the drug works,
*  you just ask a patient if they can walk or you ask a patient if they can think and
*  they say yes, and you're all good.
*  That's where you want to get.
*  Josh, you were, you were saying, you know, one of the things going into industry has
*  allowed you to do is kind of step back, kind of assess from afar.
*  And I've been able to do that as well.
*  Even though I've still been very much in the learning mode, I've been learning a
*  vast amount of different things about neuroscience and AI.
*  And it has allowed me also to have a bigger picture to step back because I haven't
*  been sitting in a monkey for eight hours, you know, paying attention to their
*  behavior, et cetera.
*  But Kay, you haven't had that luxury.
*  So what I want to ask from you is one, you ever think about going into industry?
*  And two, if you, if how, how you allow yourself to take time to assess and think
*  and look broad picture because that seems to be lacking in a lot of people.
*  What do you mean by larger picture, larger picture, like including even life or.
*  No, no, no.
*  Larger neuroscience brain mind, you know, because you're in the thick of it, you're
*  in your daily routine.
*  You're thinking about that next even denser EEG system and how the heck you're going
*  to get it on their heads within 30 minutes or whatever, you know, to, you know, to be
*  practical, to get them in the rig and how to get the rig quieter.
*  All of those sorts of things that have to be running through your mind.
*  And then to think about the scientific questions and what actually progress is
*  and how to make progress and what to make progress on, et cetera.
*  Right.
*  So for me, so far, what's been working out for me is to be just selfish.
*  I want to figure out what I want to do.
*  And I convince others that what I think is important is important to them.
*  And that has been okay.
*  You mean grant reviewers?
*  Exactly.
*  The grant or writing a paper.
*  That's what that has been keeping me alive so far.
*  Right.
*  But I, and then the way that I think, I think the best strategy is to make it
*  relatable and luckily my sense, I don't get too deep into these theoretical land
*  too much or modeling based plan.
*  I stay empirical questions that shapes.
*  My research is usually coming from everyday moment, everyday moments, everyday
*  moment, everyday failures is where I, where I get motivation to do research.
*  And so far it's been playing out.
*  Maybe that's thanks to the chaotic situation that psychology and neuroscience
*  is in right now, it's an infancy.
*  So that's why maybe my model works.
*  But that's something that I have been doing from undergrad all the way up is to
*  think about every day and how that, you know, why life sucks is the motivation.
*  Why am I being scolded for forgetting to do this thing?
*  The other, why was I paying attention to the other?
*  While I promised to do other things, right?
*  All these everyday failure is the motivation for me to do the, to the science.
*  Right.
*  Well, then I have to distill it down to some testable hypothesis and crafted
*  experiment that can devineate possible alternative hypotheses, but yeah, that
*  has been working so far.
*  And what was the other question?
*  You ever consider industry?
*  No, because I don't think I I'll be allowed to do that.
*  Allowed?
*  Yeah.
*  Do you come up with a question from my failure and test it out?
*  I mean, you'd be surprised, right?
*  I mean, the same, the same influence machine you've used to further your own
*  thoughts and ideas is exactly the kind of, I mean, that that's what gets you by
*  in a, in a industry setting.
*  I mean, knowing things and being able to, to convince people that you know those
*  things and that they're right and being able to, I mean, it's exactly the same
*  game, but instead of me writing it on a page and sending it to the NIH or to,
*  you know, neuron, I I'm doing that for leadership who has $40 million in their
*  pocket and I propose an experiment and my grant is a 20 minute presentation that
*  goes through the same convincing properties that you might lay out in like
*  a 20 minute talk, but they just give me the money to do that thing.
*  That sounds great.
*  Maybe I should consider industry.
*  It's the same.
*  I mean, it's exactly the same thing.
*  It's, it's like an efficient version of, of the NIH.
*  That, that sounds great.
*  Yeah.
*  Then maybe I should go into industry, but no, I think I don't, I don't think that's
*  right.
*  The, the other thing maybe that I enjoy a lot is to talk to undergrads and graduate
*  students, that teaching I enjoy a lot and being able to talk to them and show how my
*  failure can be cool and can actually advance the understanding of something,
*  maybe at least in my small world and seeing that they seem to value that.
*  My input is really the driving force for me to stay in academia.
*  Legacy value my input.
*  That's like, no, yeah.
*  Okay.
*  If you call it legacy, then yes, you know, I feel, I feel humble that I taught
*  somebody, maybe, maybe I'm wrong, right.
*  I, but the, being able to feel that way is great.
*  Like I, oh, I, I said something that will be, that will be according to the long-term
*  memory and they may talk about it someday or who knows that feels great.
*  Right.
*  I'm just being selfish.
*  Let me give you the cynics spin on that exact same, that exact same thing.
*  I mean, I feel exactly the same way.
*  I loved, I love teaching.
*  I mean, there's a fair amount of opportunity to train people, even in the industry
*  setting, you have a lot of people that are much younger than you that don't know as
*  much stuff.
*  It's not that different than academics.
*  But for me, it's, it's just trying to like decrease future frustrations by
*  properly training people to understand how things are supposed to work.
*  Because like, what else could I, what else do I have direct impact over to decrease
*  my future frustrations than to train people to think properly and like understand
*  things or view things in a certain way.
*  It's, it's self-serving, but in a way that's like well beyond my necessarily my
*  day-to-day.
*  It's like just trying to put out people that also get this stuff so that it's
*  less frustrating for everybody in the future.
*  Let's say in academia, that's a good segue, Josh, in academia, you know, going
*  into graduate school, if you had to do something differently, if you could do
*  something differently, would you, would you have done something different that
*  you would advise people, you know, that something you did that you shouldn't have
*  done or something you wish you had done that you think would have made you even
*  more awesome than you are now?
*  I mean, I only retrospectively, no, I mean, it's like a typical imposter syndrome,
*  right?
*  You feel like, you know, literally nothing for most of the time.
*  And then one day you kind of realize, Oh, well, I guess I get this as well as
*  anybody else.
*  And now, now I understand things.
*  It would be more like, I mean, it's, it's sort of like, I couldn't do anything
*  differently, but I can reflect on the things that got me to the point where I'm
*  like a happy functioning person who has some level of success looking back on 10
*  years plus of my life and trying to pick out those things through introspection
*  that could be useful to them to save them the hassle of having 10 years worth of
*  imposter syndrome and toiling away.
*  I mean, trying to give them shortcuts to get there just based on my own experience
*  and those things working.
*  So what you would say is just short circuit the getting over imposter syndrome.
*  And that is probably the most useful thing.
*  I mean, nobody knows what they're doing early on, but you pretty quickly, I mean,
*  you know, you give your first talks, you're like, God, everybody's going to
*  just skewer me.
*  I barely know this stuff, but in actuality, because everything is so focused and
*  people are really within their own subdisciplines, they only care about
*  themselves.
*  There's about, yeah, I mean, there's maybe five people that know it as well as you,
*  even as like a second year grad student.
*  So why feel bad about it?
*  You know, as much as anybody.
*  Speaking of psychology, the spotlight effect is wrapped up in imposter syndrome
*  that everyone's thinking about you all the time.
*  No, no, they're never thinking about you.
*  They're thinking about themselves.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a huge, I mean, it's like, I,
*  I see it a lot.
*  It's an impediment.
*  People don't like trust themselves to know things.
*  They feel like they know less than everybody else.
*  For some people that's sort of like a chip that they're like, no, I'm going
*  to know this better than you.
*  And it propels them.
*  Aren't those strange people?
*  Yeah.
*  But, but for some people it's like, I don't really get it.
*  And I'm never really going to feel confident in myself because I don't
*  realize that the rest of the world actually knows less than I do.
*  Yeah.
*  I gained a quiet, strong confidence realizing that I don't know is always
*  the correct answer.
*  Almost always the correct answer.
*  And that is the actual answer that everyone has also in their minds.
*  It's the thing that leads to the most interesting, like discourse and learning
*  too, if you can, if you can just speak up and say that, I mean, you know, the
*  person that's teaching you or whatever that's talking there, they're like, yeah,
*  it really doesn't make any sense.
*  Let me help explain it a little bit based on my understanding of it.
*  It leads to like 10 minutes of really good conversation and understanding.
*  You lose all of them.
*  I may have gone a little overboard with the, I don't know, in lab meetings.
*  I don't know if you guys could tell me that.
*  Okay.
*  What do you think?
*  Um, if you could start over, would you, uh, how would you start over again?
*  Would you do something differently?
*  Nothing different.
*  Of course you would never.
*  Nothing, nothing.
*  No, I know there were things that I could, I regret that moment, but you
*  know, years passed on that regret was what made me, what made me where I am now.
*  Right.
*  So I won't need to struggle the things that I struggled.
*  What's something that you wish you knew going into neuroscience research?
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  Right.
*  So that's that I think the best moment of that is my interview
*  with Jeff Scholl and Jeff Whitman.
*  I was like, I'm going to record from that near that part of the brain, that part of
*  the brain at the same time, you know, and then I will figure out how multiple items
*  it are stored in working memory in monkey.
*  And yeah, they were like, yeah, good luck.
*  But I didn't know what that good luck meant.
*  Right.
*  So in hindsight, you didn't know sarcasm at that point.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I was really thrilled and I was so, you know, I've been, I'm sick of brainwaves.
*  It doesn't tell me anything about the single neurons.
*  And I was like, I'm going to record from all the neat, you know, not all, but.
*  Yeah.
*  Collection of neurons at the same time.
*  Figure this out.
*  Nope.
*  Little did I know.
*  Right.
*  So maybe practically speaking, right.
*  I still, I still appreciate that they allowed me to try it out and fail.
*  Right.
*  In a way, well, in the sense that I didn't get to train multiple monkeys and get it
*  into a paper, I really appreciate the learning experience, but practically, if I
*  had said, Oh, it stayed realistic and let's just figure out how monkey, but
*  remember one thing and how does that change brain oscillation at a particular
*  area of the brain, maybe I had something that can be publishable.
*  So you have training wheels on and you appreciate that.
*  But what, but what do you wish you knew?
*  That it's impossible.
*  That's really hard to do.
*  That's impractical.
*  Right.
*  Well, no, maybe it was, it was dead end for me, but it was not for some people,
*  but it wouldn't have been not for some other people.
*  And I appreciate that they took chance with me.
*  Yeah.
*  Little known fact back in the day that there was broad consensus that you would
*  not get any good data from monkeys just based on who you are and how you go about.
*  Josh, anything, how, you know, uh, something you wish you knew going in got nothing.
*  No, I, I, I honestly can't say that there's anything I wish I, I mean, only
*  what I said before, I wish I, I wish I really understood that most people really
*  don't know as much as you think that they do just, you know, to, to, to get the
*  confidence to push your own sort of like whims that you're thinking about that
*  you're not willing to speak up on.
*  I mean, you, you hold those things in, if I would have known like not what I know
*  now that most people don't understand most things and that you're, you know, as
*  much as somebody has 25 years of experience, there's the things you are working on.
*  You are more of an expert than they are.
*  I think that would have changed things a little bit.
*  I mean, I tend to like sit back and wait until the time is right to say something.
*  If I would have always felt like the expert, I probably would have spoke up a
*  lot more and I may have left.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  Good.
*  Okay.
*  Last question, guys.
*  Kay, did you have a, you looked like you're about to,
*  yeah, no, not maybe getting into neuroscience, but getting into the
*  academia and being sure this right.
*  Not everybody is you or the people that you knew.
*  Not everybody.
*  Say that again.
*  Not everybody who works there, who come to your lab and work with you are not
*  the people that you, you are who you are or the people you know.
*  Right.
*  And then they are there for the right reason.
*  And they are different people.
*  They have different things that they want to cheat.
*  And that's not okay.
*  Is what you're saying.
*  No, that is okay.
*  I need to know that don't assume that, but that's okay.
*  Science is for everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Actually, that's a good, that's a good tip to leave on Kay.
*  Cause I mean, I experienced the same thing a lot, like it, just because you
*  have a way of doing things that worked and not everybody has the same sort of
*  drive or motivation or interest.
*  They can get to those places pretty well with taking a different path.
*  Different trajectory.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's not always clear at the being, you just have a small sample size.
*  Yeah.
*  The bigger your sample size gets, the more you understand, no, okay.
*  There is another way to get there.
*  That's not how I would have done it.
*  But all right.
*  Throw away question.
*  You're going to be frozen for either 15 years or a hundred years and then
*  reawakened reinvigorated, which one do you do?
*  Josh, you go.
*  Oh, I would say a hundred years, probably because, you know, I might be able to go
*  live on Mars, that's an optimistic one.
*  I think whether it's 15 or 100, we won't be that much closer to understanding mind.
*  Okay, we can make.
*  Hmm.
*  That's a different question.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  When will, when will I be satisfied?
*  No, probably when I'm about a thousand and seven.
*  Okay.
*  What do you think?
*  I'm 15 or a hundred.
*  I'm totally 15.
*  You're totally 15.
*  I'm totally 15.
*  I still want to be, I want to, I still want to play, play my game.
*  Hundred.
*  I'm convinced that I won't be able to play my game.
*  I want to do, okay.
*  Remember?
*  I don't want to read shit and catch up.
*  I want to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, okay.
*  Okay.
*  Then I'll add one.
*  Let's say you get to time travel a thousand years back or a thousand years in the, in
*  the future, which do you do?
*  Okay.
*  You go first this time.
*  Back.
*  Back.
*  Man, that's crazy.
*  Wow.
*  I'll do back.
*  I would totally do back.
*  My life would be so much easier and like, uh, you know, with no, with no conceptions of
*  science, I'd wake up in the morning and have some dumb idea and I'd be the smartest guy
*  for thinking about it.
*  I would rather do that.
*  I feel like I'd have a lot more contribution that way.
*  I like being the dumb guy and I'm good at it.
*  That's why I'd go a thousand years into the future.
*  Uh, wake up and know nothing, you know?
*  Well, no, I mean, you're, you're going to end up in the same spot.
*  I want to figure things out.
*  Have you seen any accuracy?
*  I mean, you know, you go a thousand years into the future.
*  I mean, the human race is going to be so, so low.
*  You're going to be like God.
*  When you come out talking about neuroscience and all old days.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't want to see what, I don't want to see what people look like in a thousand years
*  mentally.
*  I I'm feeling pretty bad about 2020.
*  So I, everyone's going to look like hentai.
*  Probably.
*  Okay, guys, this has been a lot of fun.
*  So we've taken a long and winding path.
*  Thanks for, thanks for joining me.
*  It's really been good seeing you and, uh, I don't know, it feels like back in the old
*  days a little bit.
*  Totally.
