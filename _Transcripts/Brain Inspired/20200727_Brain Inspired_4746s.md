# BI 079 Romain Brette: The Coding Brain Metaphor
**Brain Inspired:** [July 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPTQHTFQafE)
*  So it's something that I felt really needed to be thought about, because if you don't
*  solve this question for yourself, what is it that you're doing?
*  How do you know that you're doing something good?
*  My point is rather that a code, a neural code, doesn't have the properties that would make
*  it a good representation or meaningful representation for an organism.
*  Isn't it wild that we can do so much under such false assumptions and metaphors?
*  That's a difficult question.
*  I mean, yes, I know we've made progress, but what kind of progress?
*  Well we can...
*  I still personally have no idea what perception is.
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  Good day, everyone.
*  Welcome to Brain Inspired.
*  I'm Paul Middlebrooks.
*  This episode I spoke with Romain Brett, or if you're into more American bastardizations
*  of French names, Romain Brett.
*  He's a theoretical neuroscientist and the research director in computational and theoretical
*  neuroscience in the Vision Institute, which is in Paris.
*  In this episode we start off talking about theory versus modeling versus experiment,
*  but then we get into topics from his article in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, which encompasses
*  much of what he's been thinking about and writing about for over a decade now through
*  blogging and various other published articles.
*  The paper is called Is Coding a Relevant Metaphor for the Brain?
*  And the central claim is that we misuse the term code when we talk about a neural code
*  and its relevance to the organism and to the organism's brain that is said to be encoding
*  things in the world.
*  There's an important difference between a brain's perspective and our perspective as
*  an outside observer, giving those brains tasks to perform.
*  When we try to understand how some neural activity relates to the task, we use our own
*  perspective rather than the brain's perspective, but we talk as if we're using the brain's
*  perspective.
*  Hopefully that will become clearer in our discussion.
*  That discussion includes topics like various notions of information, representation and
*  its various roles and properties.
*  We get into process metaphysics versus substance metaphysics, so lots to think about here.
*  Before that, we get into the interesting and unique experience of writing a Behavioral
*  in Brain Sciences article.
*  I link to the relevant material at braininspired.co.uk.

*  If you take one thing away from this episode today, I think the thing to take away is something
*  that Hoeman has done that I would strongly recommend you implement if you can, and that
*  is to set aside some block of time every week to ponder the meaning and implications of
*  whatever you're doing, its validity and so forth.
*  That's what I think, and Hoeman is a real testament to how that kind of practice can
*  pay off.
*  So, I wish that for you.
*  Hoeman, thanks for joining me on the show, and good late afternoon to you.
*  I know it's late afternoon in your world.
*  Thank you for inviting me.
*  So you have a really broad range of interests from spike initiation, how spikes are initiated,
*  in neurons, all the way up to broad philosophical issues in the theoretical neuroscience world.
*  But I'd love to hear just how you characterize your interests.
*  That's a difficult question.
*  Maybe another way to ask it is not many people cover both the theoretical side and broad
*  philosophical questions, which you cover in essays on your blog and in published manuscripts,
*  and also getting down to the nitty-gritty of spike initiation, for instance.
*  So I wonder maybe where these interests came from, if you've always had such a broad array
*  of interests, or if it's sort of developed the theoretical and epistemological side has
*  developed over time, or if it was the other way.
*  Yeah, so the epistemological aspect of my work has developed fairly recently, I mean,
*  maybe 10 years ago.
*  I don't know, maybe from reflection on my own work and out of frustration.
*  Yeah, what do you mean?
*  What's the frustration?
*  What was the frustration?
*  You know, I've been working a little bit on some systems neuroscience, specifically on
*  the audition, sun localization and things like that.
*  And I don't know, at some point I felt a little frustrated.
*  I was wondering whether we were making any progress, really.
*  It felt like writing papers were like kind of rhetorical exercises.
*  And so that was the frustration.
*  At some point I felt that I needed to take some time to think about what it is that we're
*  doing and what's the meaning.
*  But I think a lot of people feel that way.
*  I felt that way.
*  So there's progress at large in neuroscience, and there's also personal progress.
*  And when you're doing the rhetorical exercise of writing a paper, that paper is progressing
*  your career, presumably, or that's the hope.
*  And then you also have three other papers in the background waiting to be written.
*  And so one can hardly take the time to think, well, now I'm going to step back and consider
*  these larger issues and work on them.
*  I don't think many people feel the luxury of time to do that.
*  How did you manage that?
*  That's an interesting question.
*  I don't think it's a luxury, but it's something that doesn't come naturally in the sense that
*  we're always involved in various projects and typically we don't really have time to
*  really think deeply about philosophical issues or conceptual issues.
*  And so for me, what I decided to do is just take one day off, I mean off the normal work,
*  to just take time to think about things independently of any paper or project or whatever.
*  Just take some time to, in my case, it was time I took to write my blog.
*  So every Wednesday, I would take the day to just think about whatever I felt I wanted
*  to think about and write something about it.
*  Yeah, so I did that on different subjects.
*  It's still on my blog.
*  So some on perception, quite a bit on perception, some more general about philosophy of science,
*  things like what's a good model, things like that.
*  I mentioned that this came out of frustration a little bit.
*  Part of it was scientific frustration, but also the frustration that you experience when
*  you're a theoretician in a very empirical field, like biology.
*  That is that many biologists, they don't really understand what theory is and what it's for,
*  what's the use of it.
*  And there's a lot of confusion between theory and running a model, making a simulation.
*  That's not the same thing.
*  It's conflated often in the biological realm.
*  The model is the theory, for instance.
*  Yes, right.
*  But the simulation is not an explanation.
*  And in theory, what you look for is explanations.
*  And that's not the same thing.
*  But then, this is something probably many people like me have experienced.
*  You have to explain, it is your responsibility to explain why your model, your theory is
*  good or not.
*  But what does it mean?
*  It turns out that's not at all an easy question to answer.
*  What's a plausible model, for example?
*  You know, you have this phrase, biologically plausible.
*  I never quite understood what it meant.
*  What's biologically plausible?
*  Does it mean that you have to name it a neuron?
*  It has to have channels.
*  What's that?
*  It's not easy.
*  And there are different, you can see in the field that there are very different perspectives
*  on this.
*  You have, well, broadly characterized, you have this, you have bottom-up and top-down
*  approaches, or you have normative approaches.
*  You start from a problem, typically a computational problem, that would be a David Maher's approach.
*  And then you think of how this problem might be solved, and then you look for an implementation
*  in the brain.
*  That's one theoretical approach.
*  And you have other approaches to developing theory, which starts from looking at the properties
*  of neurons, measured properties and things like that.
*  And then you try to understand what maybe emergent properties of this, of this, of this
*  components and things like that.
*  And I don't think either of these approaches is fully satisfying.
*  But just to say that there are different approaches actually to what modeling is, what good modeling
*  is, and I don't think people agree on that.
*  So it's something that I felt really needed to be thought about, because if you don't
*  solve this question for yourself, what is it that you're doing?
*  How do you know that you're doing something good?
*  So I think it was an important thing to do.
*  But one can come to a place where it reduces the rate of your experimental work to zero,
*  because you realize that almost everything you're doing has no firm ground upon which
*  to stand.
*  And then where do you go?
*  Do you just leave experimental biology or neuroscience completely?
*  Or do you somehow bring the theory in and fix the experimental problems that you're
*  working on?
*  These things are very abstract that I'm saying right now, I know.
*  But the worry is that your productive work in the lab will just come to a screeching
*  halt if you really had to consider all the theoretical issues, because it's still also
*  up in the air.
*  So you manage to continue on.
*  But just in your head, do you ever think, well, I need to not do any experimentation
*  and just consider these larger questions, because they're the bigger questions that
*  are ultimately going to be the roadblock we need to get past?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  I think different approaches have value.
*  You can just sit on your chair and think about theoretical questions, and it can be valuable.
*  It can not necessarily is, but it can be valuable.
*  But what I think is also very variable is an approach in which you don't necessarily
*  distinguish theory and experiment as different kinds of activities.
*  And I think that's, I don't think experimental science actually exists as something completely
*  isolated.
*  It shouldn't, anyway.
*  It's not just that it shouldn't, it's that it doesn't.
*  Because every time you do an experiment, even a measurement, you're doing it because
*  you have some idea in mind, you're doing it because you're either trying to prove something
*  or you're looking in some direction.
*  And that is to some extent theoretical.
*  It's just that you might not make it explicit to yourself.
*  But all science is theoretical to some extent.
*  You're trying to answer some questions, you're not just trying to just report an anecdote.
*  So any empirical science is to some extent theoretical.
*  And for these reasons, I think it's valuable if you think about the theory that is implicit
*  in your scientific activity.
*  And then if you make it explicit, you might have a chance to question it and to make progress
*  on that.
*  Another aspect of this is that, so, you know, for instance, we're going to talk about your
*  behavioral and brain science paper, which relates to a lot of your other thoughts and
*  work here.
*  But when you start reading something like that about whether coding is a relevant metaphor
*  for the brain, then you can really go down the rabbit hole and you end up in some philosophically
*  deep waters.
*  And we only have a limited number of hours in the day.
*  I mean, you have a family, I know, I have a family, we have obligations to the world.
*  Sometimes we have to shave, I haven't in a while, you know, and things like that.
*  Sometimes we have to shower.
*  But then you can spend all your time just going down the philosophical road.
*  And I think it's really valuable to at some point you have to resurface and make some
*  sort of progress with that theoretical background.
*  But it's really tempting to just keep swimming in the philosophical waters.
*  It seems to be a difficult balance.
*  Do you think that we have the right balance right now between theory and experiment in
*  neuroscience and in, you know, the study of intelligence, a larger picture?
*  It's a difficult question because first it depends what is meant by theory.
*  Yeah, so what is meant by theory?
*  I mean, there is quite a bit of theory in neuroscience.
*  But I think that you go to a typical neuroscience lab and it is vastly experimental with theory
*  sort of in the background.
*  No, that's true.
*  That's certainly true.
*  not just neuroscience, it's very empirical generally.
*  The question is what kind of theory we need.
*  I see quite a bit of, I mean, a lot of modeling, developing models and data analysis a lot
*  these days, particularly.
*  These days, yeah.
*  Because we have more data than before, maybe.
*  But to me, that's not really theory.
*  That's not what I would call theory.
*  Theory I would give an example of theory.
*  Theory would be Darwin's theory of evolution.
*  That would be kind of the main theory in biology.
*  And it's not mathematical necessarily.
*  But it's theoretical in the sense that it's broad.
*  It's supposed to explain things that are general.
*  And this kind of theory, I don't think there is so much of it in neuroscience, in biology.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's also because it's very difficult to develop this kind of theory.
*  So the balance between theory and experiment, I don't know, it's a difficult question because
*  there's not a single kind of theory.
*  And at the same time, I'm not sure the question is well framed anyway.
*  Sorry.
*  No, no, that's great.
*  Here we go.
*  This is what I'm talking about though.
*  Because every step of the way, you have to think, well, is it even the right question?
*  Which is what we're going to talk about with the coding metaphor as well in a few minutes.
*  So for example, you know, I've been trying to write a book on the accessibility and action
*  potentials.
*  And by doing that, I've read a lot of old papers from the 50s and 60s and so on.
*  Like Hodgkin-Huxley type?
*  Exactly.
*  And it's really fascinating when you really read those papers.
*  I mean, Hodgkin, he was doing the maths and the physiology, right?
*  And the physics.
*  You can see that his understanding of the physics is really deep, actually.
*  And at the same time, obviously, his understanding of physiology is very good as well.
*  And the kind of theory he was making was really indistinguishable from his empirical work,
*  I think.
*  So it's a kind of scientific activity which you cannot categorize as either theory or
*  experiment.
*  Yeah, I don't...
*  Do we even need to think of Hodgkin-Huxley work as theoretical because it is so just
*  descriptive of the physiological processes?
*  Well there definitely is some theoretical development, that's for sure, of the eonic
*  theory of accessibility.
*  You know, nowadays, we think about this work and it's just things that we read in textbooks.
*  And we don't realize that 70 years ago, it was not at all obvious that there were eons
*  passing through channels, little holes in membranes and things like that.
*  So all that, they had to imagine based on a number of clues and to contrast them with
*  other hypotheses which existed at the time and which we just don't discuss anymore so
*  much now.
*  That's right.
*  So there was definitely a strong theoretical development there and the experiments were
*  there to further develop the theory.
*  Yeah, so that was an interesting balance even though I don't think balance is really the
*  right word, it's really the interaction that is interesting.
*  But in that case, so model fits right in between theory and experiment in that case, right?
*  That's where sort of modeling, it didn't begin obviously with Hodgkin and Huxley but
*  that's a quintessential very early model.
*  These days, models are ubiquitous and when I say you walk into a neuroscience lab and
*  typically it's mostly experiment, I actually include modeling in that these days because
*  everyone has a model, the model experiment loop but then the theory connects almost to
*  the model which then connects to the experiment and then there's a quicker loop with modeling
*  and experimenting and I almost consider that was one thing at this point.
*  So in the case of Hodgkin and Huxley, they use the model to, I mean as a tool to try
*  to confront theory or to develop the theory.
*  But nowadays when we use a Hodgkin and Huxley model, we don't do theory.
*  That's right.
*  We don't do theory, we take the model, we say well a neuron works in this way and I've
*  made these measurements, I put them in the model and I simulate it.
*  But at the time, it wasn't like that.
*  It was, well I will make the hypothesis that the membrane is permeable to sodium and so
*  let's say that this current is, I model this current in this way, I put this all together
*  and if I do this, I can see that the different measurements I make are coherent basically
*  and that's how the model is used.
*  And it's not the same thing to, it's completely different from the data-driven approach where
*  you measure a bunch of stuff and you put them in a model and you expect that by simulating
*  it something new will come that you haven't measured.
*  But that's not developing theory.
*  Maybe that's using some theory for sure.
*  But the model here is not used to develop theory.
*  But it can be used to develop theory.
*  What I had intended to ask you about and to focus on is your behavioral and brain sciences
*  paper is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain.
*  And just before we step into talking about this, I actually want to ask you about the
*  experience of writing a behavioral and brain sciences paper briefly because the idea of
*  this type of journal, of this type of article is wonderful.
*  So for those who aren't familiar, the idea is that someone like you, Roman, writes a
*  piece, writes an article and then there's an open peer commentary section where, I don't
*  know how many commentaries were there?
*  20?
*  25, 26?
*  25, yeah.
*  So it's a lot of commentaries can then be written in response to the quote unquote target
*  article and then the original author of the target article can then respond to those responses.
*  And in principle, I love this idea because it's open, you get to see everyone's thoughts
*  about the target article, for instance.
*  But in practice, even reading it, I find it extremely frustrating often because the open
*  peer commentary is, I would say more often than not, not so much focused on the target
*  article, but instead in advancing their own theoretical perspective and their own ideas.
*  And some hardly touch on any of the issues in the target article and instead just jump
*  to whatever they want to be talking about at the time and use the smallest little bit
*  of the target article to then be able to write about whatever they want to write about.
*  Many people don't, actually.
*  There are some great commentaries that are very specifically focused on the target article.
*  But I wonder what your experience was like writing that and if you agree with my assessment.
*  And I honestly, I don't know what the open peer commentary instructions are to the commentators,
*  if it is to focus on the target article specifically or to use that as a bridge to whatever the
*  hell you want to talk about or whatever.
*  So I just wonder about your experience with that.
*  Yeah.
*  Writing this paper took me a lot of time.
*  But it's built off of a lot of previous work and blog articles, which maybe that's part
*  of the time you're referring to.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, actually, I started writing this paper maybe eight years ago or something like that.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And I had it read by a couple of people.
*  And then I buried it because I thought, I don't know, I thought it would be quite controversial.
*  I would make lots of enemies and for no good outcome.
*  I was very hesitant to actually publish it.
*  I don't know why at some point I decided I should get it out.
*  But anyway, I rewrote it completely and I decided to send it to this journal, which
*  is really a great journal.
*  I've read a number of papers in that journal, which are really cool.
*  The format that you described is very interesting.
*  I find it extremely valuable to have these commentaries that normally you would see nowhere
*  in response to two papers.
*  So that was interesting.
*  The process itself was a little bit painful, I have to say.
*  Took maybe two years, I think.
*  From submission to then get commentary and then respond to the commentary.
*  And then publication.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus.
*  And because, I mean, these commentaries come after a standard formal peer review.
*  And in my case, I had, I think, maybe seven reviewers, at least.
*  Don't remember exactly.
*  A very large number of reviewers.
*  And because then...
*  A typical, so just to state it, a typical neuroscience paper, for instance, has three
*  reviewers or so.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Or two.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Two or three.
*  Yeah.
*  So I don't know if it's actually usual for BBS.
*  But in this case, I think the paper was very polarizing.
*  There were reviews that were really completely different in terms of appreciation of the
*  paper.
*  Some say that it was complete nonsense and others really thought it was insightful.
*  So that was not easy to respond to these reviews.
*  I basically rewrote the paper.
*  You're talking about the initial reviews of the seven reviewers?
*  Yeah, the initial reviews.
*  Those are the initial reviews.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And then it took a lot of time as well.
*  And then it took a lot of time for them to respond.
*  One of the reviewers flipped.
*  It was positive and then negative.
*  And then I had more reviewers.
*  And basically the reviews were very split.
*  But yeah, in the end, the editor decided that maybe that was the kind of papers that the
*  journal was looking for.
*  Something that creates some controversy.
*  And then the commentary process.
*  I don't think there are particular instructions actually for commentaries.
*  They don't have to be criticisms of the paper.
*  They can be just commentaries on a few points that are just touched by the paper and that
*  people want to expand on.
*  For example, it's quite free.
*  And people make proposals for commentaries.
*  Oh, I see.
*  Which the editor selects.
*  So in this case, I haven't seen the proposals.
*  I don't know who proposed a commentary, but that was maybe, I don't remember exactly how
*  many.
*  So there are some commenters who are invited and some who didn't propose.
*  So you sent one page proposal, something like that, for the commentary, where you, not even
*  that half a page, where you explain what points you want to comment on.
*  So what's your personal expertise and things like that.
*  And the editor selects based on, I mean, in order to have some diversity in the views,
*  mainly, I think.
*  And so I think there were, I don't know, maybe 70 submissions or a lot of submissions.
*  But I didn't get to see them.
*  I saw only the commentaries that were invited.
*  And it was an interesting process to respond to this commentary.
*  Very unusual because you have to make one response to 25 people.
*  And it's a bit difficult to make something that is readable.
*  Yeah, because you have to summarize so many different people's points of view and integrate
*  it and lump them, lump 15 of them together in one respect and then 20 together in another.
*  And yeah, it's, yeah.
*  But it was interesting because it, I mean, in the process, it made me formalize some
*  new points, basically.
*  So I think the response is valuable to, I mean, it brings some different points than
*  the main paper.
*  I agree with you.
*  And I think that it's super valuable for you, the writer, that's most valuable for you.
*  But for the reader, it's so it's a taxing endeavor to read because you read the main
*  paper, which has, it's putting forth ideas.
*  And as the reader, you're trying to assimilate these ideas into your own worldview and then
*  think critically about it.
*  And then you read all of the reviews, if you're so inclined.
*  And when you read reviews, whose authors seem only to write to advance their own agenda
*  and not even to address issues in the article or not even to compare their own agenda with
*  statements in the article, then it becomes extremely frustrated because you've already
*  spent so much time on this thing.
*  As the reader, as the writer, I think it's the most valuable thing you can probably do.
*  And yet still taxing.
*  Maybe the way they should present it is to have the response before the commentaries
*  because in the no, because in the response I, I have, they asked me to cite each of the
*  commentary.
*  So I really present a synthetic view of the commentaries.
*  Yeah, that might.
*  Yeah, but that's an idea.
*  That's an idea.
*  So if you want to, to read it, yeah, maybe it's better to start with the response.
*  Well, yeah, I just, I wanted your take on it because I've read many of those articles
*  and it's a, it's a common theme that's frustrating as a reader.
*  It's just, some people just want to advance their, their own ideas.
*  I've read other papers in BBS, like Kevin Oregon's paper, for example, on sensory motor
*  theory of perception.
*  And it's interesting to see also the different views that exist in the community, the diversity
*  of views that people have.
*  Even if you disagree with them or don't find them relevant, it's interesting to, to see
*  that they exist.
*  And that's something that you typically don't see in the literature, especially on broad
*  issues like this.
*  That's right.
*  No, I mean, in principle, I think it's a wonderful format and you know, you, you enjoyed the
*  process, correct?
*  Yeah, it was a bit painful, but I, I think the, I'm happy about the results.
*  Yeah, good.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's talk about the results.
*  So, so the, so the paper is called is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain.
*  So let's say I, I, let's say I'm a monkey neurophysiologist because I was, let's say
*  I wheel my monkey in his chair into the lab.
*  You know, I put him in front of a screen and show him some images and I'm recording neurons
*  while he looks at those images.
*  And I can tell every time when he sees a giraffe, because the neuron that I'm recording starts
*  firing a lot whenever a giraffe appears on the screen.
*  So that means that that neuron is encoding giraffes, right?
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  So here you're referring to the technical sense of, of code.
*  That is to say there is a correspondence between two things.
*  One thing in the world or stimulus parameter, something like that, and something that you
*  measure in the brain.
*  So there is a correspondence and you call that code in the same sense that there is
*  a correspondence in the Morse code between letters and dots and dashes.
*  And so far it's, it's fine.
*  I mean, it's just one word that you use to, to talk about correspondences.
*  But the problem is that very quickly we use, there's a drift between this technical sense
*  and different senses, which are much broader than that.
*  Because in the, in the sense of a correspondence, saying that a neuron encodes stimulus doesn't
*  mean much.
*  It's, it's not very relevant.
*  You could say also, yeah, an example that I gave on a paper that a rain encodes atmospheric
*  pressure.
*  You could say, you know, any two things that covary, you can say it's a code.
*  But when we say this new and encodes giraffe, we mean a little bit more than that, probably.
*  And I say probably, but very often it's explicit.
*  In fact, what women is that the brain is using this code to form an image of the giraffe,
*  a representation of that giraffe to know that there is a giraffe that he's looking at.
*  The problem is that there is no logical implication between these two senses.
*  The technical sense of correspondence and the sense of representation.
*  And by correspondence, you mean a correlation between the two things, right?
*  Just a correlation.
*  Yeah.
*  Correspondence would be maybe a strong version, but of course can be statistical.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's this, most often the representational sense is something that is implied when we
*  use code.
*  It's not even implied.
*  We write it.
*  I remember writing, you know, the neural activity represents whatever the psychological
*  phenomenon was and getting back responses.
*  You can't use represents there because for the same reasons that we're talking about.
*  The subtlety is that we use the term represents or represents, for example, but there is always
*  this ambiguity about who is the target of this representation.
*  Because of course this neurons activity represents the giraffe for you, the neurophysiologist.
*  The more difficult question is whether it represents something for the monkey.
*  And this is much more difficult to assess.
*  And so yeah, there's this drift here when we make this confusion between the observer's
*  perspective and the organism's perspective.
*  Even the term perspective might be actually confusing.
*  Sure.
*  In the paper you call this semantic drift, which is a shifting of the meaning from correlation
*  correspondence like you said, to more, to larger claims like representation and causality,
*  which we haven't mentioned yet.
*  Yeah.
*  And the semantic drift you find in the coding metaphor, but also more generally in some
*  scientific writings quite often is we use technical terms like information.
*  I mean, technically they have a very precise and limited sense, but we also use the term
*  information when much more broadly in a way that has little to do with Shannon theory.
*  Well, so let's go and just talk about information for a moment because this comes up in the
*  paper.
*  And so when people say information, typically we can assume that they mean Shannon information,
*  I suppose.
*  But there are other alternative definitions of information that people use.
*  I mean, there's the colloquial information as in, I don't even know how to describe it.
*  So the nice thing about Shannon information is that it's a very specific meaning about
*  communicating messages between a sender and receiver.
*  And the issue there is that the sender and receiver both have a set of possible messages
*  that could be being communicated.
*  So they're both sort of external observers in that sense.
*  And I mean, maybe you can elaborate on this, but as you were just saying, the coding metaphor
*  and the sense of representation implies that there is someone for whom the representation,
*  someone who has a perspective for whom the representation exists.
*  And your point is that that is the experimenter because I know that the giraffe is on the
*  screen.
*  So I know that the activity of the neuron is quote unquote representing that giraffe.
*  But the monkey in this example would need already a representation of the giraffe, a
*  set of possible messages, the giraffe being one, for that neural activity to be representing
*  the giraffe in their mind.
*  Maybe you can unpack all of that instead of me just rambling on here.
*  Yeah.
*  So information in communication theory is a very specific kind of information as you
*  explained.
*  So the activity of that monkey neuron would be informative that there is a giraffe in
*  sense that there is a correspondence between the activity of that neuron and the presence
*  of the giraffe.
*  More generally, you have also graded, graded correspondences.
*  For example, one example that I know well is in the sun localization, you have neurons
*  whose activity like the frying rate, for example, covariates with the position of the sound.
*  And so when you see this firing rate, you can deduce the position of the sound.
*  But one thing that we'd easily forget in discussions about information is that in such correspondences,
*  there are always not two things, but three things.
*  There's the position of the sound source, there's the firing rate, but there's also
*  the correspondence between the two, the mapping.
*  And to deduce one of these three things, you need to have the two others, not just one.
*  So if you just have the firing rate, you have nothing really.
*  You just have some neuron blinking basically.
*  So to deduce the position of the sound source, you would need also to know the mapping.
*  But that an organism would know this mapping makes little sense in fact, because it's a
*  mapping between something in the brain and something in the world.
*  It cannot be something that the organism possesses.
*  It's just a description that the observer makes.
*  So this makes this type of information relevant maybe for an observer to quantify certain
*  relations between observable variables.
*  But it's not the kind of observation that is relevant for an organism in terms of perception.
*  And it's not the only meaning we give to information in general.
*  For example, you could say that if you read a physics textbook, you learn some things,
*  you're going to get some information about the world.
*  That's right.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  What kind of information are we talking about there?
*  Is it something that we can quantify in a number of bits?
*  That's not what it's about.
*  The kind of information we get is a relation between different kinds of things in the world.
*  It's things that you can do in the world and expectations that you would get from that.
*  It's not in terms of Shannon theory.
*  It's not what we mean here.
*  And this is a perspective that is probably more relevant for an organism.
*  What kind of information does an organism need?
*  Well, it doesn't need to know, for example, that the sound is at 2.5 radians on the right
*  of its nose.
*  Probably not.
*  But what it needs to know is that if it turns its eyes in a certain way, it will probably
*  see something moving.
*  And so this notion of information is a notion that is relational.
*  It's not a number.
*  It's a relation between things, different things, things you can do, for example, and
*  the expectations of your sensory signals, this kind of things.
*  In the sense of turning, so there's a sound, and for the organism to know if I take this
*  action, I might see something moving.
*  Would it be accurate to say that in the relational information sense, if I turn my head, I will
*  be toward the direction of perhaps seeing something moving instead of I will turn my
*  head 2.7 radians, and that is the place where I will see something moving.
*  Am I off track there thinking that the relational sense of information then is more of a directional,
*  a gradient based rather than a calculate the angle at which the fly will be flying near
*  me to reach out with my tongue and grab it, for instance.
*  Two points maybe.
*  First information for an organism cannot be in the sense of a reference to something that
*  is outside the organism.
*  This is the first thing because it's outside the organism.
*  So that reference is only useful for someone else.
*  So that's the first thing.
*  So if you say that this firing rate encodes the sound location because I can deduce the
*  angle from it, you're missing something.
*  Right.
*  By relational, the relational view of information, what I mean is that information in the sense
*  of say the laws of physics, for example, is not a set of values.
*  It's relations.
*  For example, the relations between different properties of a gas, the law of perfect gases,
*  where you have different relations, which is PV equals nRT.
*  That's the information you have about properties of gases.
*  It's not value.
*  It's just some relations that exist between things.
*  In sound localization, for example, you have relations such as, well, this sound wave arrives
*  one millisecond later than this other sound wave, things like that.
*  You have different relations.
*  Other types of relations are sensory-motor relations.
*  If I make this movement, I expect these sensory signals to be such and such.
*  Part of your point is that the movement itself is crucial in that accounting.
*  The information has to do with specifically if I make this movement, because that's internal
*  to the organism, correct?
*  You can also have relations that are purely sensory, like in pitch perception, for example.
*  Sounds that evoke a pitch are sounds that are periodic, basically.
*  The relation that there is in those kind of sounds are periodicity.
*  They follow a certain law.
*  That's something that you can observe if you just see the wave, basically.
*  There are relations that you can observe which are sensory.
*  You have different kinds of relations, sensory relations or relations with your own movements
*  and things like that.
*  In any case, what you get is something that has structure.
*  That's something that cannot be captured by tuning curves, for example.
*  Often, especially in sensory neuroscience, maybe it's less the case now, but a lot of
*  sensory neuroscience has been in terms of tunings of neurons to different properties.
*  But that cannot work.
*  That's almost legacy, though, from recording single neurons and presenting a bunch of different
*  conditions.
*  Like you just said, it is changing with the multi-electrodes these days, where you're
*  measuring a lot of different things, a lot of different neurons at once.
*  Tuning curves are still very prevalent.
*  Yeah, well, I don't know if that's changed so much.
*  You can make tuning curves multidimensional.
*  It's still the same problem.
*  The problem with tuning curves is that they are bad variables.
*  But the variable only exists if you have defined the object.
*  For example, the orientation of a bar exists once you have defined that there is a bar.
*  And same for sound sources.
*  There must be a source.
*  All these ideas of inferring parameters, properties of things in the world, it's not that they're
*  relevant, but they are conditional of first having built a world.
*  That is, you need to have objects for them to have properties that you will infer.
*  And that's a very important part of perception that is dismissed in this approach.
*  Formation of objects and scene analysis, things that you find in gestalt theory, for example,
*  that has completely disappeared in the tuning curve approaches.
*  And these are, to me, the difficult parts of perception.
*  How is it that a bunch of pixels is an object?
*  I don't think pixels is right here, but anyway.
*  So in perception, in information in general, there must be a notion of structure, relations
*  between things.
*  And so in the neural coding literature, you don't see that.
*  So you've called this relation, this relational aspect of information like the laws and physics.
*  You call this subjective physics, the idea that there are laws that relate the sensory
*  signals specifically with actions.
*  Not specifically, but yes.
*  It's an analogy, which I'm probably certainly not the first one to make, between science
*  and perception.
*  That is to say that, so in science, you're trying to look for relations between observables
*  and also between things that you can do and observables, that is, experiments.
*  And for an organism, there is something similar in that, well, you want to know what would
*  happen if you do certain things.
*  So you want, that's the analog of an experiment.
*  If I make such and such actions, what would happen in terms of the sensory signals, for
*  example?
*  You could also say, we can also observe some relations, as I mentioned before, between
*  different kinds of sensory signals.
*  For example, this event and this other event have some similarity or some relation to the
*  other, and things like that.
*  So there are laws that an organism can observe.
*  There's something a little bit homoncular here.
*  Something what?
*  Sorry?
*  Something homoncular here.
*  Homoncular, okay.
*  When I say that the organism observes sensory signals.
*  Sure.
*  You can't avoid all language issues.
*  Yeah, I put it aside for now, but it's a little bit of a problem.
*  But anyway, you imagine that you have a certain number of sensory signals and you can make
*  some actions where you can gain some knowledge by observing relations between sensory signals
*  and relations between actions and sensory signals.
*  And this idea you find in different authors.
*  One is Kevin Oregon with the sensorimotor theory of perception.
*  You also have Gibson, of course.
*  Gibson, probably one of the first authors that really made me think deeply about these
*  issues and who is not properly understood by computational neuroscientists, I think.
*  Not properly understood or properly appreciated?
*  Or both?
*  Both, both, I think.
*  And part because of confusion on the words, information and things like that.
*  But you like his idea of affordances and that way of...
*  So, affordances is the most known concept of Gibson.
*  It's obviously an important concept.
*  But in fact, what I found really interesting at the time when I read his book was the concept
*  of invariant structure.
*  And so he says there is information in the invariant structure in sensory flow.
*  And what he means by that is that when you move your head, for example, he was mainly
*  working on vision, but it works also for audition and others.
*  When you move your head, when you move in the world, the sensory signals change.
*  But the change in the way that is highly structured, because these signals come from a world which
*  follows the laws of physics.
*  And so there is structure in this sensory flow, which you could say is the projection
*  of these laws of physics on your organs.
*  And so there is some structure, projective structure, etc.
*  As you change, it progresses in accordance with those physical laws.
*  But it's dependent on your changing and moving and acting.
*  And it also takes a form that is specific of your own perspective.
*  Which makes it internal and not dependent on an external observer, which is the whole
*  key of...
*  Yes.
*  That's why, for example, he disagrees with the idea that we reconstruct the 3D structure
*  of objects.
*  Like that what we're seeing, what we have internally is a perfect representation of
*  the external world.
*  Yes, in the sense of physics, you would imagine that you have a bunch of atoms and they are
*  laid out in 3D space.
*  And that's what you're trying to reconstruct.
*  Right.
*  In your internal model.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's not what we do exactly.
*  Because he argues, and these are very simple arguments, you just have to open your eyes,
*  basically, is that the visual world is a world of surfaces.
*  It's not a 3D world exactly.
*  It's a world of surfaces that reflect lights.
*  And so what you see are surfaces.
*  And so you get laws from your own perspective, which are related to that.
*  But you don't really reconstruct 3D in the sense that you're making a 3D model as in
*  a virtual reality model.
*  Yeah.
*  You're on 3D printer in your head.
*  That's not exactly that.
*  Right.
*  So anyway.
*  So we were at Gibson and in variances.
*  Yeah.
*  So the idea of information as relations.
*  And so this, yeah, this Oregon, this Gibson, also find that way back in like a century
*  ago in Poincaré, for example.
*  Charles Sanders' purse, the pragmatists touch this as well.
*  Yeah, pragmatism.
*  So pragmatism is also related to the idea of affordances.
*  What kind of digress here, but it questions what representation is supposed to and what
*  function it's supposed to feel, actually.
*  And this is important because I mentioned before that one problem with the coding metaphor
*  and why it is a metaphor is that we use it in a technical sense, but then we actually
*  use it also in a more representational sense without demonstrating the link, basically.
*  We claim representation when what we've done is correlation or correspondence.
*  That's right.
*  And my point in the paper is not to say that there are no representations.
*  Some reviewers interpreted in this way.
*  Yeah, that's interesting.
*  In fact, it's a little bit the opposite.
*  Not exactly.
*  But my point is rather that a code, a neural code, doesn't have the properties that would
*  make it a good representation or meaningful representation for an organism.
*  And in fact, if I could make a specific criticism to the use of general coding metaphors that
*  don't take representation seriously in the sense that we say that some neurons activity
*  represents a giraffe or something like that, just on the basis that there is a covariation
*  between the existence of a giraffe and this activity.
*  But I mean, there's a lot of literature on representation in cognitive science and philosophy
*  of science and philosophy of mind.
*  And representation is not just that.
*  Representation is supposed to fulfill some function and to have some very specific properties
*  and to demonstrate those properties is not trivial.
*  Why do we think there are mental representations in the first place?
*  Well, there are different arguments for four representations.
*  One argument is that, well, we behave in the world and we also think, perceive things.
*  And this seems to happen in our brain.
*  Well, the activity of neurons, but it's about something outside our brain.
*  And so there's this intuition that we're using representations that are somehow determined
*  by the environment, but at the same time accessible to the organism.
*  So one of the very important properties of representation is that it has to be something
*  intrinsically accessible by the organism.
*  And that's something that a code is not, first thing.
*  A code is not accessible to the organism because it's defined on the basis of a correspondence
*  with something outside the brain and only on that correspondence.
*  So that's the first problem.
*  And the second property of representations, why would we need presentations at all, is
*  some form of abstraction, I would say.
*  For example, I'll take again the example of sound localization.
*  You have, for example, a cat.
*  It's in the grass and it's listening to some noise.
*  It's a mouse scratching the grass.
*  And then it hears that and it goes to the source of the sound.
*  It eats the mouse.
*  What is very interesting about that is that when you look at the sound waves that arrive
*  at the ears of the cat, well, there's no direct indication of where the mouse is.
*  And the mouse is scratching the grass, it makes different sounds.
*  The sound waves are different, but the position of the source is still the same.
*  And so the cat seems to behave as a function of something that doesn't depend directly
*  on the sound waves, but something that is more abstract, something that is invariant
*  to many aspects of the sounds.
*  What sound exactly it is.
*  Only it seems to depend on where the sound comes from.
*  That's why we think, well, the cat uses some kind of representation of where the sound
*  comes from and uses that to do some action.
*  And it could also, with sounds coming from the same position, it could decide to flee
*  if the cat thinks it's something threatening or depends on the cat's state.
*  With the same sensory signals, the cat could do different actions, and it does these actions
*  as a function of something quite abstract, something that has invariances to intensity
*  or to the precise thing that the mouse is doing.
*  If we want to show that something is a representation of sound location, what you need to do is
*  not just that in your experiment, there was a covariation between the position of the
*  source that you moved and some measurements that you make.
*  You need to show that it's a representation of sound location.
*  You have to show that this thing actually doesn't depend on something else.
*  It's not going to be completely different if you change the pitch of the sound or if
*  you change whatever.
*  Otherwise, you're not talking about a representation of sound location.
*  You're just talking about some covariation between two measurements.
*  That's all.
*  And the third property of representation, and maybe the key property of representation
*  that you will find in the philosophical literature, is that a representation must be verifiable.
*  It can be right or it can be wrong.
*  You need to have this called system detectable error?
*  That's because a phrase says that a representation must have a truth value, a possible truth
*  value that can be assessed by the organism itself.
*  For example, for the cat, the cat can run and then it will find the mouse and eat it
*  or not.
*  So the representation will be correct or it will not be correct.
*  There's a way here to say whether the representation is correct or not for the organism.
*  But outside of the organism's own action in trying to get the mouse, outside of the cat
*  performing that action, there is no way internally to say whether that representation was correct.
*  Exactly.
*  That's the problem with the coding view of representation is that it is based on an idea
*  of representation that is not verifiable by the organism, by the receiving end.
*  Therefore, it's not a representation for the organism.
*  It's a representation for the observer.
*  It's the painting kind of representation.
*  You know, you make a painting of some scene, it's a representation of that scene in the
*  sense that you can look at the painting and you can look at the scene and check whether
*  they match in some aspects.
*  But of course, that works only if you can look at the two.
*  That's right.
*  But the brain cannot look at its own activity and at something outside itself.
*  There's a problem here with this notion.
*  But your subjective sense and or my subjective experience, if I'm going to turn and eat the
*  mouse, is I do see it as a painting.
*  I see it as a world model as if I have a model of the world.
*  I see it as a 3D model of the world.
*  And maybe the only way out of that is to say that we do have internal models of actions
*  that we can compare against and that eventually we end up subjectively experiencing these
*  things.
*  I know that you avoided consciousness as a topic really in the paper.
*  But it's related to the idea of representation because it seems like something.
*  Something it seems like is not the way that you're describing the way that representation
*  truly works internal to the organism.
*  I wonder if you could touch on that.
*  What on consciousness?
*  Well, yeah, just the discrepancy between what our subjective sense of what representation
*  is commonly thought of.
*  So I can represent the mouse in the field and I can imagine it, right?
*  And I can have a subjective experience of thinking of that mouse 2.7 radians behind
*  me or whatever.
*  But if that doesn't match to the way we actually are quote unquote representing the way that
*  representation necessarily has to happen for us to have a representation and for it not
*  to be a representation for an external observer.
*  I guess what I'm saying is the subjective sense is as if you are an external observer
*  to that representation.
*  Yeah, so the problem with representation is not so much.
*  No, sorry.
*  The problem with code is not as I say so much with the problem of representation.
*  I mean, there is a case for mental representations in some sense, which at least in some pragmatic
*  sense, that's that was actually what the cat example illustrated.
*  That is to say that the cat has some representation of where the mouse is in the sense that it
*  can go there at some potentially position and then and then get it.
*  And so it has this truth value in this sense to say it can be a representation, but it
*  doesn't have to be a thing, a thing that you have in the brain that you can look at.
*  That's that's the main issue with encoding.
*  You can think of representations in terms of the desired properties that biological
*  organisms do have all these, you know, acting as a function of abstractions and expectations
*  and things like that.
*  But it doesn't have to be a thing that the brain is looking at.
*  So there's something I touch upon, in fact, related to consciousness in my response,
*  which is that, yeah, as you say, we have this intuition that we have representations
*  because of our consciousness.
*  I mean, we experience something, something about the world, but it's in us.
*  And so the intuition is that since this is generated by our brains and if we're materialist,
*  we must believe that there must be some mapping between the state of a brain and the mental
*  representation.
*  And this, I think, is misleading intuition.
*  So I gave a thought example, a thought experiment in my response.
*  Do you know the TV series Bewitched?
*  Oh, yeah, Bewitched.
*  That's right.
*  I remember this example when she wrinkles her nose and blinks or something and everyone
*  freezes while she continues to...
*  Did you know this TV series?
*  Unfortunately, I watched too much television as a child.
*  So yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  So, okay, there's this witch in disguise and she's a housewife.
*  And so she can twitch her nose and when she does that, the world freezes and so she can
*  do different things and solve different problems.
*  And then she unfreezes and the world keeps on as if nothing happened.
*  Now the question is what happens during the time when the world is frozen to the person
*  whose brains are frozen?
*  Military guy, wasn't he?
*  The man of the house was a...
*  I can't remember the character.
*  Anyway, yes, what happens to him when he's frozen and she's solving problems?
*  Yeah.
*  During that time, is he just experiencing the same thing during all that time?
*  Perceiving something but just for a long time?
*  It doesn't seem right.
*  It doesn't seem right.
*  You would think that actually what happens is just he hadn't noticed and it's for him
*  really that even just didn't happen.
*  In fact, just like he experienced in the show, like it didn't happen.
*  Right.
*  But if you think that there must be a mapping between the state of the brain and what you're
*  experiencing, then that's what you should think though.
*  And what this suggests to me is that experiencing, it's a verb, experiencing or representing
*  is an activity.
*  A process.
*  It's a process.
*  It's not something...
*  It's not a painting.
*  In fact, there's no such thing as a painting.
*  Right.
*  Even a painting.
*  You look at a painting, it's an activity again.
*  So I think it's just wrong to look for something like a painting in the brain.
*  There is no painting that we'll look at.
*  It's just the activity.
*  And so maybe to think in terms of representation, we should perhaps think in terms of properties
*  that we were looking for in the system.
*  Those properties like abstract properties, expectations, these kind of properties, anticipatory
*  properties, et cetera.
*  This is related to the notion of a process versus substance metaphysics, which I'm not
*  sure we have time to really get into, but this is from, again, Bicard's work, which
*  I know you're fond of.
*  And you made me go down the rabbit hole and read a bunch of his work.
*  So thanks for that.
*  But the idea then is to think of representations as processes.
*  Well briefly, the process versus substance metaphysics is the notion, the difference
*  between that there are things in the world, particles, atoms, versus there are not things,
*  there are processes in the world.
*  There are the processes by which we call atoms and the things that we see.
*  And we live generally in a, we sort of assume in our daily lives that the world is made
*  up of substances, of things, when it could be made up of processes.
*  And it's hard to wrap my head around it, but I, in the past year or so, I keep revisiting
*  in this idea and thinking it's more and more correct that there's no such thing as nouns.
*  There are only verbs.
*  Yeah, I think it's the key point, probably.
*  And it's not just about perception and representation and all that.
*  I think it's whole biology.
*  If you take a cell, a neuron, even though we say a neuron lasts eight years or so, well,
*  everything that constitutes the neuron has changed many, many, many times over that duration.
*  The Heraclitian neuron.
*  You know, there's turnover.
*  It takes, you know, over a few days or maybe weeks.
*  All the proteins have been replaced.
*  It's really a dynamic thing.
*  When you really look at it, you just don't realize it, but it's a dynamic thing.
*  And even something like a ionic channel, some form of abstraction.
*  You have processes that involve proteins and different things in the cell, and it's dynamic.
*  And to understand a cell, you need to understand the organization of those processes rather
*  than the stuff that they are made of.
*  That's right.
*  This is challenging.
*  This is challenging.
*  It's related to the point that we discussed previously about Frankenstein models.
*  That's related really to this substance metaphysics.
*  We think that, well, there is the sodium channel.
*  There is the potassium channel.
*  I put them together, I get a neuron.
*  But by doing that, you dismiss the organization of processes.
*  The fact that all these channels, they are related to each other by different processes,
*  which implies that their properties are, in fact, related.
*  And these are things that we know, in fact, that has been documented.
*  And the challenge is to think in terms of the organization of the cell, the dynamic
*  organization of the cell, rather than the substances that a cell is made of.
*  Well, OK, so I know that we have very few moments left here, and there are two questions
*  I would like to ask you if you have time.
*  So one is just, so the coding metaphor, let's just say you're right that it's a problem,
*  that neuroscience, biology, neuroscience, let's say, has made tremendous progress.
*  Eventually it will run up against a wall, right?
*  But it's interesting that we have been able to make so much progress under a false metaphor.
*  And I wonder, well, what you think about that?
*  Isn't it wild that we can do so much under such false assumptions and metaphors?
*  That's a difficult question.
*  I mean, yes, I know we've made progress, but what kind of progress?
*  Well, we can.
*  I still personally have no idea what perception is.
*  But who cares if you understand what perception is, as long as we can help people with dementia.
*  You know, that's a completely different question, because you can cure people without having
*  any idea how the drug works.
*  So that's not really the issue here.
*  Maybe not drugs.
*  You could under a coding metaphor potentially stimulate neurons in a very particular pattern
*  to give someone relief from their anxiety, for instance, right?
*  And only having gone this far under the coding metaphor from Hubel and Wiesel on up, right?
*  You know, I'm not sure Hubel and Wiesel committed the coding metaphor.
*  In fact, when you look at the papers.
*  Yeah, OK.
*  So you're saying from the...
*  Let's not get into a diet drive about the history, you know, but from, let's say, Barlow,
*  for instance, right?
*  You know, would that make you happier, Barlow?
*  Well, if you look at Barlow, that's interesting, because in his early papers, he talked about
*  coding in the retina mostly, and he makes it very clear that it's just one particular
*  perspective.
*  So it's fine to use metaphors, in fact, as long as you're aware that it is one and you're
*  aware of the limitations.
*  I mean, metaphors or I mean, analogies more generally.
*  Analogies, yeah.
*  They are very useful scientifically.
*  They help you think, develop concepts.
*  It's not a problem in itself.
*  What's the problem is to confuse the analogy with the real thing.
*  So it's a particular perspective on the system.
*  In the case of Barlow, he was looking at the retina.
*  And in the case of the retina, there are some arguments to use a communication metaphor.
*  I can think of two.
*  One is that you have things that belong to two different domains.
*  One is light and the other is ionic currents, the biological domain.
*  And there's an interface where these things need to be translated somehow.
*  And I'm using linguistic metaphor.
*  And so there is a case for using communication ideas for transduction.
*  There's also a case for using communication ideas when you think of the optic nerve.
*  The optic nerve creates a bottleneck where you have to, you know, it's very difficult
*  not to use those metaphors, but I can use them.
*  I'm comfortable using them.
*  As long as you wink when you say it.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, you have this bottleneck.
*  You have the eye is in the front of your head and the visual cortex is in the back.
*  And so you have to convey all this information.
*  Yes, he's doing air quotes.
*  Yes, you can't hear a quote.
*  Exactly.
*  From the retina to the visual cortex, there is a case for using communication metaphor
*  because there is a communication issue.
*  But then using communication metaphor in once you're in the cortex becomes much more questionable.
*  Who are you talking to?
*  Who's the brain is talking to exactly?
*  That's a bit problematic.
*  In the case of the retina, well, it's mostly one way.
*  It goes from the retina to the cortex.
*  Okay, maybe a little bit, a few things back, but not much.
*  It's mainly one directional.
*  Yeah, so you could, it's a perspective that has some value.
*  But when you just take one neuron in the middle of the cortex, that's a bit more difficult
*  to make the case.
*  So yeah, I don't think using metaphors is a problem in itself.
*  It's just that when it becomes so widespread that it seems that you can't do any science
*  without using it, then it's a problem.
*  It's interesting.
*  Go ahead.
*  And Barlow, in fact, in his papers, talks about the idea of efficient coding.
*  But he also explicitly mentioned other possible hypothesis, one talking about what these neurons
*  are doing, like detection.
*  I don't remember exactly.
*  But, or yeah, another perspective is control, for example, and it's a completely different
*  perspective.
*  Right back from the cybernetics movement.
*  Which is exactly.
*  He just thought that in his case, it was a good perspective, basically.
*  But it doesn't mean that it's a universal perspective on perception or on the brain.
*  It's interesting, Claude Shannon himself even wrote a piece warning against taking his sense
*  of information, which he had seen explode into all other domains of science.
*  And everyone was talking about Shannon information.
*  He wrote a little, just a very short piece warning people, this is not the only sense
*  of information and it's not applicable to all domains.
*  We don't heed those sorts of warnings.
*  We just move forward with what we see as successful metaphors, I suppose.
*  Yeah, I even quoted a review which said that Shannon information is basically the only
*  good definition or formal definition of information.
*  Like gallastel?
*  Are you talking about Randy?
*  No, no.
*  I'm sorry, I forgot.
*  It's in the paper.
*  I forgot who it was.
*  I disagree with that.
*  It's happened again.
*  We've only gotten to about a quarter of the things that I wanted to talk about, but this
*  has been a lot of fun and hopefully it's just a good teaser for people to go and read your
*  paper and be introduced to the rest of your work in your blog, for instance.
*  So I know you have to go pick up your child.
*  I have to go make my child breakfast, my children.
*  I only make breakfast for one child at a time.
*  But I really appreciate the time and hopefully we can do this again because there's lots
*  more to talk about.
*  We didn't even get to talk about AI, which I was going to ask you about.
*  But continue the good work, man, and I appreciate it.
