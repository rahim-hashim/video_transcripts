# BI 155 Luiz Pessoa: The Entangled Brain
**Brain Inspired:** [December 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC9ovrSExGQ)
*  As you know, it's not entangled that you can disentangle.
*  It's really that its inherent nature is entangled in the sense that we don't have these clear-cut
*  boundaries, this more modular view that has been so prevalent, so dominant in neuroscience
*  for forever.
*  Because the connectivity is so massive, it helps us understand that we need to go moving
*  away from a space of anatomical connectivity to a space of functional relationships.
*  But if we want to solve problems that are similar to what embodied animals solve in
*  intelligent ways, I think we need to solve a couple of problems that bring us to emotion.
*  And here's my way of thinking.
*  My way of thinking is that...
*  This is Brain Inspired.
*  That was Luis Pessoa.
*  Luis is a professor at the Department of Psychology at the University of Maryland, College Park,
*  where he runs his laboratory of cognition and emotion.
*  His latest book is The Entangled Brain, How Perception, Cognition, and Emotion Are Woven
*  Together, which is aimed at a more general audience.
*  In broad strokes, the book argues that we need to move past the traditional modular
*  view of the brain, which is still prevalent.
*  You still come across statements like, brain area X does cognitive function Y, or, for
*  example, the amygdala does emotion, and so on.
*  But instead, we should account for the highly interactive and integrative functional organization
*  of the brain.
*  So we discuss some of the implications of approaching the brain from a complex systems
*  perspective, some of the principles of organization within brains that Luis believes will help
*  reshape how we study and understand brains and brain function.
*  And Luis has long been interested in the interaction between emotion and cognition, which you can
*  learn more about in his previous, more technical book, The Cognitive Emotional Brain.
*  So we discuss emotion and cognition and why emotion might be important for artificial
*  intelligence.
*  And we discuss a lot more as well.
*  Many of Luis's ideas are in line with those of Michael Anderson, who's been on the show
*  recently.
*  So if you liked that recent episode with Michael Anderson, you'll probably like this one as
*  well.
*  Show notes are braininspired.co.
*  slash 155, where you can also learn how to support the show through Patreon.
*  Thank you to my incredible Patreon supporters.
*  OK, here's Luis.
*  Luis, the book is The Entangled Brain, How Perception, Cognition, and Emotion Are Woven
*  Together.
*  And there's a lot, the book does a lot, and there's a lot for us to talk about.
*  One thing maybe I would just start with is that I find the structure of the book interesting,
*  because you go from a modular, you know, modular descriptions of the brain, and you're
*  warning the reader the entire time that you'll eventually destroy that modular view.
*  And then you build up from what you describe as a minimal brain to more complex, modular
*  view of the brain, tracking evolution along the way.
*  And then you come to the destroying part, where you argue for new ways to think about
*  how to connect brains and behavior.
*  So that's a lot to unpack right there.
*  But maybe we'll just start with the title, Why Entangled?
*  Why the word entangled?
*  Right, right.
*  So let me just say one thing before that, that the structure of the book is something
*  I really struggled with, because I wanted to write a book to a general audience.
*  I did not want to write, I had written a book many years ago, 10 years ago or so, that was
*  for a specialized audience.
*  And it was fine, it was published, and I think it's a fine book.
*  But what I really wanted was to write something that sort of reminded me, like when I was
*  an adolescent and reading books, I was really into physics and math and other things.
*  And I would read these books that I thought was really fascinating about really super
*  complex topics.
*  I don't know, like advanced physics and whatnot, that obviously I was not even in college.
*  So I wanted to write something that perhaps could resonate with someone like me at whatever
*  number of years ago, long many decades ago.
*  So I really struggled on how to write it.
*  I did definitely want to write it for a general audience.
*  So I decided to not start with something like about complexity theory and build it from
*  there and even leave the entire past behind and just forget about a more modular view
*  of the brain.
*  Was that a struggle for you to do that?
*  No.
*  No, no, actually, somehow it was natural.
*  It was natural.
*  But I don't know if it worked because I'll tell you a couple of things.
*  One I'll tell you in part because it's a little delicate.
*  An initial set of reviewers was really confused about it.
*  It said, this book is not working because you are suggesting this is a complex system.
*  This is an entangled brain.
*  Going back to your original question of entangled, the idea is that this is kind of intertwined
*  to the extent that we don't have these clear-cut boundaries between these standard domains
*  that we always talk about.
*  Perception, cognition, emotion, motivation, action, and so on.
*  And I wanted to have a framework that would sort of dissolve these boundaries.
*  And at one point I was, what's the title?
*  The network brain, the highly network brain.
*  That just didn't really work.
*  And the network brain had been something that people had been talking about for 10, 20 years
*  even.
*  And I threw it out on Twitter, of all things.
*  And there were suggestions.
*  And among one of the suggestions, to be honest, I don't even remember if I said is entangled
*  good or someone suggested entangled.
*  I think more likely someone literally suggests how about entangled?
*  And I said, oh, that's perfect.
*  So in a way, it is perfect because I view it, I think it's quite adequate.
*  But as you know, it's not entangled that you can disentangle like some knot that you're
*  going to disentangle and oh, I fixed it now and it's all crystal clear and disentangled.
*  It's really that its inherent nature is entangled in the sense that we don't have these clear
*  cut boundaries, this more modular view that has been so prevalent, so dominant in neuroscience
*  for forever, for a very long time.
*  That being said that obviously since the historical beginnings of neuroscience, there's always
*  movements for networked views from the very beginning and more anti-localizationist views.
*  So it's this continued swing of a pendulum going more modular, more distributed.
*  The extreme would be something like Lashley's equipotential views that it doesn't matter
*  what you take out, scoop out is just proportional to the volume that you take out, which is
*  obviously not the case.
*  So yeah, long answer there.
*  There's really an idea to try to move us away from thinking, having almost this reflective
*  way of thinking about the brain in this very modular clockwork machine-like type of analogy
*  that we often make.
*  So that was the goal is to have a title and someone, there were some suggestions and I
*  think that worked well.
*  I was all set to congratulate you on coming up with a new term that fits, but maybe, but
*  you don't even know if I should be congratulating you because you outsourced it.
*  Yeah, no, I think it's even better.
*  It's outsourced.
*  I think it was the collective there.
*  So going back to the structure, it surprises me, well your answer surprised me that it
*  was really about reflecting on your journey and your early fascination with these kinds
*  of works.
*  You just mentioned that the modular view is the reflexive kind of view and I thought it
*  was maybe based on that because that's where we all kind of start, right?
*  And it's like the most natural and it's kind of unnatural to think, to start or just to
*  think in terms of complexity and those sorts of issues that complexity brings up.
*  So I thought maybe that's why you wrote it like that.
*  No, it is.
*  It is that I, no, I think you're right.
*  No, you're right.
*  I wrote it like that because of this way that we were taught, but that is very natural for
*  people to think, at least in the West and the way people think in the world.
*  I think that that somehow is very natural and I was part of a very large group of people
*  at the University of Maryland trying to create an institute at some point, starting maybe
*  10 or so years ago.
*  And there were people from the humanities and we would often start talking about the
*  brain and when people would talk about the brain, it was so natural for them to think,
*  okay, this part of the brain does dysfunction and this other part does dysfunction.
*  So if you have this problem in the amygdala or in this other region, you can be anxious
*  or you can, so it was so natural for them to think in that way that I just wanted to
*  convey something that we would try to break this naturalness.
*  And if I started from, okay, there are all these physicists and mathematicians that created
*  all these complex systems and dynamical systems theory and let's just adopt that.
*  And that's chapter zero and then we build from here.
*  I think I would lose the ability or the possibility of sort of pushing back, like, okay, we have
*  these areas.
*  Okay, but what really are areas?
*  I mean, what do they compute?
*  Do they compute one function?
*  Is it one-to-one mapping?
*  Is it one-to-many, many-to-many?
*  What kind of functional repertoire areas have?
*  How do we think about areas?
*  And what are even areas?
*  How do we find boundaries and how do we define them?
*  So I wanted to, the breaking was part of the process of building it.
*  But I do think that my first drafts, some complete worked out drafts, left that a little
*  bit not well worked out enough that the reviewers had problems.
*  And I think in part, it was justifiable, more than justifiable.
*  And so I went back and I kept on, like you said, I kept on reminding the reader that
*  we're going to break it, we're going to break it, we're going to break it so that it seemed
*  to have some flow, perhaps unusual or unexpected, but that at least didn't leave the reader
*  confused about, well, there was all this modular stuff and then you turn to complex systems
*  in chapter, emergent behaviors in chapter eight.
*  Shouldn't that be chapter one?
*  I mean, there was some chapter two, some reviewers said this should be chapter two.
*  Yeah.
*  How long, when did you break yourself and are you comfortable now?
*  Oh, go ahead, answer that and then I'll have a final.
*  I mean, actually, to me, it's coming back home in a way.
*  So it's to me is the opposite.
*  And obviously, neuroscience is large enough and diverse enough that there are multiple
*  views, this view could be very productive or perhaps not because the modular view is
*  defended by many people still.
*  So I'm not saying that it's we should just completely abandon it.
*  So and I'm not saying that I'm having this vision from early on that was ahead of my
*  time. But I started from that perspective because I started reading things like Dennett
*  and the Mind's Eye. And then I did my Ph.D.
*  in the Department of Cognitive and Neurosystems at Boston University with Grossberg's
*  group. And so everything was already and I was really into reading about dynamical
*  systems. I was doing a major in computer science and math.
*  And many of my closest friends were doing honors thesis or already in graduate school,
*  doing something on dynamical systems.
*  And so that's sort of a distributed parallel distributed processing was something
*  that in a sense seemed natural to me and then it got only solidified with my Ph.D.
*  And so when I started when I went away from computational neuroscience after my Ph.D.
*  to more experimental neuroscience, it's when I really got to learn more how biologists
*  and neuroscientists in particular think.
*  And I learned of this way of bringing things a little closer in terms of the mappings one
*  to one or perhaps not exactly one to one, but where a double dissociation type of experiment
*  when you do these lesions and you investigate the respective types of deficits, it can lead
*  to more conclusive statements about the specificity of the deficit and the way the areas carry
*  out or parts of the brain carry out specific functions.
*  So I really learned these things after in more depth, at least at the very least after
*  graduate school.
*  And I started learning this vocabulary in this way of thinking.
*  And so it's kind of the book is kind of going back all the way from to my first readings
*  about I don't know, I should take a look again, the chapters in the Mind's Eye.
*  Do you know that book by Dennett edited by Dennett and Hofstadter that has all these
*  essays on collective behaviors and termite colonies and how do they implement things
*  or carry out behaviors in this system oriented, distributed way and things like that.
*  That was basically the first few essays that I was reading in the very, very early days
*  of starting to think about the brain and learning about the brain.
*  Well once you do get to the, we're just going to jump around.
*  So once you do get to the complexity parts later in the book, you list some of the principles
*  or implications for how to think about brains based on it being a complex system.
*  And I'm just, I'm going to list them off here.
*  And then I want to ask a follow up question.
*  So I think you list five or six.
*  So interactions between parts, levels of analysis, dynamics, you know, we have to think of over
*  time as you know in a processural way, decentralization and use the word heterarchy, which is not
*  to be confused with hierarchy.
*  You want to define heterarchy for us real quick?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  I mean, I think heterarchy is just, it's really the, in my view, it's the absence of any clear
*  cut hierarchy.
*  It's so, it's just when thinking hierarchically is not a constructive way of thinking.
*  Yeah, I think that Mike Anderson, Michael Anderson used that term when I had him on
*  the podcast a while back also.
*  And then emergence and complexity.
*  And, you know, I buy into all of these things.
*  But what I want, and maybe we can dive into, you know, more of them individually.
*  But what I struggle with is to think of them, maybe because I'm from the Western world,
*  I don't know, sort of holistically and have them all in mind when I'm thinking about a
*  cognitive function or a brain area or process.
*  So have you, you said it's kind of natural for you and you're coming back to that way
*  of thinking after, you know, going learning more.
*  But do you feel comfortable?
*  Like when you think about, well, let's say emotion or something new that you learn about,
*  can you bring all of these implications or principles to bear on the problem in a sort
*  of holistic way?
*  Or do you kind of step through them and think about them in slices?
*  How do you, because I'm not comfortable yet having them all in mind.
*  Yeah, no, I mean, I wouldn't claim that it's natural in some instinctive sense.
*  I think that I wasn't exposed to some types of solutions that neuroscientists had considered
*  and had thought about at the very, very beginning.
*  I mean, I was being exposed at the same time to these multiple ideas.
*  So I always thought that it basically, to a large extent, they're empirical questions.
*  How is this implemented in the mammalian brain or in humans versus mice?
*  So there could be some more modular solutions to a problem in some species for some types
*  of functions or not.
*  So it's something that I don't, I'm not saying that it's a type of reasoning or a type of
*  thinking or type of architecture, I should say, that is completely non-existent.
*  But I think that I always thought in terms of a spectrum of ways of being organized from
*  very hierarchical, let's say, visual cortex goes to thalamus and thalamus goes to V1 and
*  V1 goes to V2 and V2 goes to V4 and V4 goes to IT and so on, all down the line.
*  And then association areas and association is that areas have some fibers all the way
*  to the frontal cortex to an apex region, all the way there where everything comes together
*  and is put together in a way that reflects past experience, your current experience of
*  perceptual and everything together.
*  So that could be how the brain works.
*  And it could be even somehow how some brains work.
*  But I was always attracted to the multiple types of solutions, because, for instance,
*  I started seeing that I had a lot of colleagues in Brazil.
*  I'm originally from Brazil and I had a lot of colleagues and mentors in Brazil originally
*  that were doing a lot of work on anatomy and the physiology of the visual system.
*  And in fact, they happened to be collaborating very strongly with Leslie Ungerleiter from
*  the National Institute of Mental Health.
*  And long story short, that's why I ended up doing a postdoc there.
*  But they were finding all these bypass connections from V2, it goes all the way to IT.
*  So this parallel type of processing was also very evident.
*  And because I was sort of in a computer science type of background, and we were talking a
*  lot about in the end of the 80s about these parallel architectures, it seemed natural.
*  And so that's the sense I think about being natural.
*  But going back to your question about how do I put all of them together, I don't think
*  I put them all together at the same time, but I view them as more guiding principles.
*  Every time that I'm trying to think of something and I start to think of something, too much
*  as a thing in itself, I remind myself, OK, but it's always temporal.
*  So we should try to let go of that and think of it more as a process.
*  So where's time in this?
*  How does it evolve?
*  What sort of trajectory does it in some state space type of situation scenario?
*  Does it evolve through or along?
*  And so this is in one part of the space of those concepts that you mentioned, the time
*  and process part.
*  The hierarchy is partly hierarchical, but it's to a good extent also violating hierarchy.
*  The latency across the visual system all the way to frontal eye fields and whatnot completely
*  violates the sequential propagation of signals.
*  So, oh, OK, that means that in addition to an existing and undeniable possibility of
*  sequential processing, there are other forms of processing that are happening in parallel
*  together with feedback because we know those exist.
*  They're ubiquitous, they're everywhere, they're an underlying characteristic of the architecture
*  itself.
*  So kind of reminding yourself of these things that at every time that you think that it's
*  something in more of one of the ends of the spectrum from modular to distributed to more
*  linear to nonlinear to simple to complex, sort of spanning this range of possible architectures
*  that different brains might carry out.
*  But I do think that these questions have to be empirical, right?
*  So a lot of my colleagues really think that there's just a lot of hand waving saying
*  the kinds of things that we say.
*  I completely understand that.
*  I do think that there is at least an equivalent amount of hand waving in the other direction.
*  I literally just shared this question on Twitter the other day.
*  So exactly what is an area?
*  So we don't even know how to define an area.
*  So an area is defined by a multiple set of criteria.
*  The borders don't coincide exactly if it's cell density or if it's receptor density,
*  if it's gene expression, if it's connection, there are these gradients and whatnot.
*  So some people say, okay, there are gradients and so it's not exactly a sharp boundary.
*  I do think that both ends, there has to be pushback because both ends seem to be having
*  to address important questions.
*  And I think that the standard story claims that more distributed processing, emergent
*  type of processing is hand waving.
*  But I kind of see the equivalent on the other side of things.
*  But I mean, that's my view at least.
*  Okay, so I'm not sure where I want to go with this, but you mentioned frontal eye fields,
*  which was one of my areas of expertise, right?
*  And how it gets spikes occur in it earlier than you would think if the brain was strictly
*  hierarchical.
*  And that's been known for some time.
*  But then, so frontal eye field projects to superior colliculus, another brain area.
*  And then probably because my training, I think, oh, superior colliculus, it does blank, right?
*  It's involved in attention, eye movements, orienting, fight or flight, the stuff.
*  And you talk about it a lot when you describe the minimal brain early on in the book.
*  But that's my natural inclination is to think, okay, well, what does it mean?
*  Or that frontal eye field gets early skip connections from whatever, V1, let's say.
*  Okay, well, V1 does this early.
*  So that's like my natural inclination.
*  And do you still think that way at all?
*  Like, you know, well, what does it mean that superior colliculus and area and frontal eye
*  field and area are connected?
*  Right.
*  No, you think like frontal eye field does this superior colliculus does that?
*  Or have you thrown that away from your thinking?
*  No, I don't think I think that way.
*  I would say at all.
*  But maybe go back.
*  Yeah, I think it's possibly at all.
*  But let me think through as I answer, because I always think in terms of circuits.
*  So for instance, the superior colliculus is embedded in some kind of circuit together
*  with the striatum or something or the midbrain or some other kind of a circuit that it forms
*  momentarily, depending on the behavioral needs and requirements.
*  And so I mean, I think it has some kind of flavors, I think, like Mike Anderson, Michael
*  Anderson, Michael Anderson said a few weeks ago in one of your sessions, that it really
*  momentarily forms, the circuit momentarily forms.
*  It doesn't mean that the superior colliculus or any other region has infinite capacity
*  to to implement anything depending on that very same moment created from nothing, creates
*  some some new kind of function in the context of that circuit.
*  It does have some clear flavors of type of processing, given its connectivity, given
*  its types of receptors, given the types of obviously the inputs and outputs are completely
*  determined or I should say are incredibly important in determining the kinds of things
*  that it can signals.
*  It determines what the signals that it receives and what it can influence, obviously by definition.
*  So it's not that it has an infinite capacity to carry out any function.
*  It obviously has some some flavor, some kind of repertoire that has some theme to it.
*  And I think that sometimes the theme can be quite complex and can be quite.
*  Multivariate in the sense that can expand quite different things.
*  But nonetheless, it doesn't have this complete flexibility.
*  That's a fact that's clear.
*  But I do think when I do think in terms of a region, I think of it, what circuit is it
*  embedded into and what's the role of the amygdala or the sub nucleus of the amygdala,
*  let's say, now that it's actually really important in this in this circuit for unlearning
*  some relationship that it had learned before that some stimulus was fear, evoking fear,
*  inducing or threat related.
*  And now it's participating.
*  These other circuits are participating in some other circuit that that actually is about
*  unlearning this relationship.
*  So, of course, the complexity is there, different subpopulations of neurons and
*  that's a lot of things need to be worked out.
*  But to the extent that we think of a little bit more macro regions, even sub regions being
*  considered in this context, macro enough, I'm thinking that they exert their functions
*  as a function of the coalitions, the coalition of regions it's grouped with, that it creates
*  this ensemble with momentarily in the function of solving some behavioral problem.
*  One answer to the question I'm about to ask you, one great answer is read my book, because
*  in large part your book does begin to train one's mind on how to think from that more
*  complex systems theory perspective.
*  But do you have actionable advice on students who come up in what is still, I suppose, the
*  dominant paradigm in neuroscience and thinking in this modular fashion of how to train themselves
*  to get out of that way of thinking and come over to the Luis Pessoa side?
*  Yeah, right.
*  I think that it's really important to be exposed.
*  I think more and more people are being exposed to ideas of complex science and network science.
*  That's something that has clearly changed in the past 20 years.
*  Let me interrupt you.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that true?
*  Because I was talking with a friend and someone prominent in neuroscience and they said that
*  they think it's getting worse.
*  Not necessarily just the modular view, but that sort of A connects to B and so A does
*  this, that that is actually getting worse in neuroscience.
*  That's not my view, but I don't know.
*  I'm kind of in the bubble that you're in.
*  I think those two statements could be correct at the same time.
*  I don't, in the following sense, in the sense that perhaps neuroscience training is still
*  very much like that.
*  But for instance, sometimes when I'm teaching a class, a course on functional MRI or some
*  other course that I teach, I ask sometimes when I introduce these concepts a little bit
*  about if I happen to discuss this in the course, I always am curious to ask them because I'm
*  teaching students from psychology and some are from a neuroscience major and some are
*  even from other majors, but they're many from psychology and so they don't come from, let's
*  say, a physics background.
*  So I always ask them, have you encountered these kinds of ideas?
*  And many of them mention environmental sciences, studying ecology and ecology and some other
*  other things that they might have studied, but also have heard of this via reading books
*  or reading other things from other areas.
*  So not necessarily about the brain, but the interconnected economy or interconnected water
*  and food supply systems of the entire planet or what have you and how these interdependencies
*  are highly complex and how this breaks a little bit this linear way of thinking that is, again,
*  I think is supernatural for everyone.
*  So I do think that because of this wave of network science, that at least in terms of
*  popularizing some of these ideas with books that were quite popular and sold extremely
*  well and were, I think, influential in the general audience education about some of these
*  I think that has happened to a greater extent than perhaps when I was at that same stage
*  of going to college or in the early years of being in college, had I not been in computer
*  science and thinking about distributed architectures because I happened to be immersed in some
*  environment that one of my mentors had studied AI and was trying to, I was doing an internship
*  and a friend of mine was, I was doing computer graphics related things and he was doing AI
*  and we were talking about these architectures, these distributed architectures for AI.
*  So supercomputers were becoming really a notion that was starting to pick up in the 80s and
*  so I do think, I think, so going back to your question, I think my suggestion is to really try to
*  find ways of reading some of these, and I wouldn't say literature because finding
*  books that discuss these issues about highly interactive complex systems and exposing oneself
*  to these ways of thinking that are perhaps a little different from something that we
*  learn in high school. We don't learn quite so much about that perhaps unless someone's taking
*  some classes in environmental science and they start, environmental science starting to get a lot
*  to those issues because they start talking about water cycles and population dynamics and other
*  kinds of problems that mapping to these kinds of formalisms.
*  So sorry to keep this kind of high level because I want to get into more concrete topics in the
*  book but you know one of the, so I've had Eve Marder on and I know that you know Eve Marder's
*  work and one of the things that she has discovered is that there's this, that structure does not
*  dictate function. It's necessary for function but it's not sufficient, right? So you can have
*  one structure and multiple different functions and this is also connected to
*  you know your ideas of about interacting brain parts and the neural reuse ideas and coalitions
*  that evolve over time. And I think when I first you know came across these kinds of ideas, my first
*  reaction was oh this is a problem because it makes it more complicated and it's a problem relative to
*  the way that you know I've been taught neuroscience. You know region A does this, region B does that.
*  But then I thought no this is actually, I started to think maybe this is more like a solution
*  but it's not really a solution so much as a principle. I think what I'm trying to say is
*  that these kinds of principles as I sit with them over time I get more and more comfortable with them
*  as being an answer instead of a problem or you know at least like toward a solution or a direction
*  but in some sense oh this is a productive solution not a roadblock to understanding.
*  Does that ring true to you? Yeah I think it does but I think it does but I think that there's one
*  challenge that feels like a roadblock which is just one. Yeah well yeah exactly like one yeah.
*  Well there's one clear one which is something that I've been thinking about a lot and I haven't
*  been able to still put on paper and other but a lot of other people have been writing about
*  which is many of these systems are incredibly context dependent. So I'm not just talking about
*  the brain I'm talking about these complex systems in general and so that becomes a
*  little bit of a that becomes an important roadblock I would say because in science we are trained
*  to do the exact opposite right we abstract away context we fix everything and we study that system
*  so that we can have to make conclusions because if everything is varying I mean we can make we
*  cannot conclude anything because obviously causally it just doesn't make sense that kind
*  of reasoning right at the first first pass but at the same time if you're dealing with a system
*  that is incredibly nuanced and sensitive to the specifics of the context that this
*  this cue was encountered in the past and together with other cues that signal that it's actually
*  safe only in that context but not in other contexts so it starts behaving in very different ways
*  that you it's experimentally and theoretically become incredibly challenging.
*  So I'm a big believer in this enormous context dependence of brain behavior and
*  it does feel daunting sometimes because it feels that
*  how do you make sense of these of this richness richness of expressions
*  that that would not be there were the system much less context dependent right so you drive a car
*  and your car is is made to be relatively insensitive to lots of contextual differences
*  you don't want it to drive hugely different over gravel versus asphalt or what have you
*  obviously it's different but and we engineer systems to be relatively to buffer us from these
*  contextual differences it's raining a little bit it's it shouldn't be a major problem it isn't
*  so it's not a good example but but the kind of engineered systems that we engineer that we create
*  are created for that that to have to be context as a context independent as possible
*  or only to the and only depend on context when we really want because okay you want to go really
*  fast and also press this button because you bought a super expensive car I mean maybe those exist I
*  don't have an expensive car so but yeah there is context contextual dependence context dependency
*  but it's of a completely different qualitative nature than in biological systems and I think
*  that is something that is very difficult to wrap our heads around because even our training as
*  experimentalists tries to remove that and so I don't think we're good I don't think there's
*  just period we don't even have good ways of dealing with that I think that we have to change the way
*  we do quite a bit of our science and training different ways because we're abstracting too much
*  of context when in some sciences I think context can be everything and and it's not just the brain
*  it's it's it's about logical systems and many other complex systems that have these these properties
*  see so now you're you're kind of a downer just now to me you were raining on my parade because
*  especially with that example of context dependency and context sensitivity because I've
*  become to really appreciate context as you know such a huge part and and that principle then
*  you know allows me to take the next step and really appreciate that our brains and our behavior and
*  you know the context within we're operating how it affects those things that oh wow you know that
*  is an amazing principle that shows you know the adaptability and plasticity of our abilities
*  right and that itself is a glorifying glorifying principle yeah I I I but it's but you say it's a
*  roadblock no I think no I don't think it's I think that's why we exist right I mean after
*  these one plus billion years or if we just start 500 million years ago or whatever whatever you
*  want to start where you want to start it's hundreds of millions of years that that that
*  that led to this kind of architecture and these kinds of architectures of all species existing
*  species on the planet and but for us to study that in in a way that is based on a standard
*  way of thinking that is largely driven by or to a good extent at the very least driven by
*  how physicists have been thinking for the past several centuries and how engineering has been
*  so successful in the past 100 plus years and so I think that way of thinking is is is very different
*  from a way of thinking that would be productive in other kinds of sciences so I do think that
*  we need to kind of a reset button perhaps not reset button but um let's shift this the other
*  direction button and and get started in ways of thinking that we we just embrace this adaptiveness
*  this plasticity this complexity this the temporal dimensions the lack of clear-cut hierarchies and
*  this naturally interacting nature that sort of determines how many systems work
*  in startup world that's called a pivot if you want a new a new term we can pivot that is a
*  that's a perfect that's a great word yeah we really need a good pivot there yeah yeah yeah
*  so I actually had a um a quote from your book uh in my notes here and and since we were talking
*  about context this will segue into our next little topic here we can think so this is from
*  the book we can think of the brain with all its different parts as evolution's solution to the
*  problem of uncoupling inputs from outputs this observation reflects a fundamental principle of
*  brain function context sensitivity see you didn't call it a roadblock there called it a fundamental
*  principle well no but that's what I'm saying right it's actually a fundamental principle
*  that poses a huge challenge for us as external observers of these systems to work out exactly
*  how what's happening so I didn't actually I think it's it's really fundamental to the existence of
*  these to these bio of these biological systems but for the experimenter the scientist in all of us
*  doing this it's it's a roadblock in the sense that we're not even well prepared to think of it that
*  way the first thing that we do is fix context like if you just tremendous advances in in in
*  learning in memory fear learning and other kinds of things decades of research the main goal was
*  to fix the context and make I mean it's literally like I say in the book is a little box that you
*  put the animal and everything is restricted and there were other kinds of approaches more
*  ethological approaches that we're trying to see what happens in more natural environments
*  but they didn't they didn't take off because it's incredibly challenging we can't have a forest here
*  and study animals doing their natural thing it's just not going to it's just and there are too
*  many things that we can't control so what what conclusions do we make so we start from the
*  premise that we need to to limit the amounts of things that can happen if you're going to
*  conclude anything but if that's not a good model for studying this kind of system and that's
*  that's up for debate right obviously people are going to say no this is still a really good way
*  and I this is like this is completely defensible and reasonable way of thinking
*  if you if if but if not then then we are kind of in trouble because doing this research for
*  instance in rodents which is incredibly important for many decades in a in an enclosed box might have
*  really incredibly limited the kinds of conclusions that we can make that actually apply to more real
*  world settings hopefully not because we we hopefully not and again that's largely is an empirical
*  thing that we're going to discover as we create more neural techniques that can be more open-ended
*  more naturalistic environments that have the animals just navigating and and living the way
*  that they live outside the lab yeah you you make more arguments like this in a recent paper i don't
*  have in front of me but where you argue that neuroscience needs to become a study of more
*  complex behaviors as well because of this kind of context sensitivity and you use threat assessment
*  and other examples and you know i've seen you use it multiple in multiple different places but as this
*  reason why we need to think about both brain function and complex behaviors in in these
*  context sensitive kinds of terms because they can change depending on all the factors going on
*  yeah i mean my own education was one in which i was never exposed to these ideas because i didn't
*  study psychology and i didn't study the whole breadth of of methods and approaches so i wasn't
*  familiar with these approaches until more recently maybe 10 years ago or maybe a little bit
*  more ethological types of approaches that really take the animals natural behaviors in their natural
*  habitats as the basis of studying behavior and the organization of behavior so i was not very
*  highly educated in in all of this this type of thinking and it just resonated completely with me
*  because i i said yeah that's that's exactly how we need to do it i mean that's not to say that we
*  can do it because we just don't have the techniques right it's easy to say well i like to study a
*  troop of about 50 baboons with this complex hierarchy and having this this these kinds of
*  fights and this kind of sexual behavior and this kind of food gathering thing and all in real time
*  well yeah everyone wants that too but obviously we can't do that take your notebook and pen out
*  there and really look look around fast take a lot of that i mean i mean people have done these
*  amazing things but what i meant is that we're not having the the neural recordings at the same time
*  we're recording all the behaviors right and so and yeah i don't know maybe one day
*  water that they drink leads to some net of of sensors that yeah yeah some magic dust you
*  throw their way and and that sends signals back of all the neurons in their brain and then we
*  we can have that and i don't know i don't know would we would we even know what to do with it is
*  is the perennial question right so right but yeah and that's what that's what these things are
*  getting at that's what you know the the like the topics in your book are getting at and these
*  principles well well you know maybe we could frame how to attack these problems using these
*  you know like dynamical systems theory which is already being being done a lot
*  and these other topics anyway i i read that quote before because it had the word evolution in it
*  and one of the things that you do in the book is that you use evolution and comparative anatomy
*  and changes in brain organization not brain structure you make the distinction between
*  organization and structure in the book what what is the difference between organization and
*  structure and why do we need to think about organization instead of structure yeah because
*  i do think going back to the themes that we've been talking about i do think that
*  in the functional the functional landscape or the functional domain of things we need to be
*  thinking about these these these circuits and so these circuits will come about with these in my
*  view to a large extent with these large-scale distributed systems that the underlying architecture
*  provides or doesn't provide let's say there are several basal ganglia loops of certain kind in
*  some species let's say amphibians fishes reptiles have loops through the basal ganglia that go to
*  the ventral striatum and only birds and mammals have in addition to those loops have another set
*  of loops that go through the dorsal striatum the dorsal parts of the striatum so this is something
*  that we don't know yet because we don't even we haven't been investigating this computationally
*  and with the computer with the with the compare comparative anatomy and comparative physiology
*  which is there's so little work on that obviously because of the the challenges so we don't know
*  exactly what these structural components are enabling functionally but it gives us clues that
*  it's allowing novel functional repertoires or or or ways of processing that are not available
*  in other species in other taxonomic taxonomic groups so amphibians don't have that so they will
*  not be benefiting from this type of organization that mammals have that mammals mammals and birds
*  both exhibit these these kinds of loops or for instance we know and have been learning a lot
*  about how the thalamus works in such close proximity and with cortex it's thalamus cortical
*  processing is essentially something that has been known for quite some time but
*  it's been more and more well characterized and understood and so these thalamus cortical circuits
*  for instance are something that is a property again not of all vertebrates so understanding
*  these kinds of structural components and their in their their relationships and the pathways allows
*  us to understand what kinds of functional organization they would they end up enabling
*  or supporting i mean that's that's if that's the sense that you were referring to organization and
*  structure yeah yeah well structure is just basic anatomy right but like there so i'm going to step
*  through in a moment um you go through five principles of organization and maybe we can
*  just say a word about each of them but you said thalamus i thought you're going to go
*  basal ganglia loops and looking at you amygdala loops which we're learning more about and the
*  comparative anatomy and the evolutionary and the development of amygdala you know looking back
*  you talk about there specifically about amygdala how you know they're because it develops from
*  different parts we can think of part of the amygdala is closer to cortex part of it is closer to a
*  subcortical structure so calling it the amygdala is kind of confusing in that respect and these
*  are based on the organizational principles of the loops that are coming through in the connections
*  with other areas right right but okay so maybe maybe we could step through uh some of the
*  principles if you don't mind we can step through some of the principles of organization that you
*  write about in the book um and i you know mainly i wanted to mention the uh the loops uh since you
*  mentioned thalamus because you go into some detail in the book um if people want to learn more
*  um about you know the the implications for the different you know loops and structures
*  in the brain in that organization principle one go ahead did you really so i thought yeah okay so
*  no no i'll read it i'll read it you don't you don't have to memorize i got it right in front of me i
*  can do it i was testing you here no go ahead no no that's staying in probably uh principle one
*  massive combinatorial anatomical connectivity so and i'll just ask you to say a word about each
*  of these as we go through yeah sure so i think one of the things that struck me incredibly so
*  around 15 years or so i really started uh studying anatomy quite a lot quite a bit in anatomy of of
*  vertebrates across taxonomic groups not just let's say humans or primates or just or even mammals
*  so one of the things that really struck me and continues to grow with this computational analysis
*  of connectomes and other kinds of things it is really this this um incredible massive
*  backbone of connectivity that links in a very structured way so it's not everything connects
*  to all by any means so it's extremely structured but in nonetheless this enormous backbone of
*  connectivity that creates this what i what i was just terming this kind of combinatorial
*  ability of linking a to b via multiple ways directly or indirectly in all sorts of ways
*  that i think is so important because it really helps us understand how we because the connectivity
*  is so massive it helps us understand that we need to go from moving away from a space of anatomical
*  connectivity to a space of functional relationships because doing my research and and interacting
*  with with a lot of people in the in the area of emotion and cognition and things like that
*  there was always a lot of discussion that that to me sounded a little confusing because for instance
*  the amygdala doesn't project very strongly parts of the the basolateral amygdala and parts of the
*  amygdala that connect to prefrontal cortex do not project very strongly at all to let's say
*  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex so that worked perfectly because you know in a way emotion is
*  in the amygdala cognition is in prefrontal cortex and they don't even talk to each other very much
*  but to me because of this kind of anatomical properties why does it have to be a direct
*  connection okay a direct connection is very powerful no one is going to deny that but
*  nonetheless no one can drive from here to new york city in some straight line and it gets me there a
*  little bit quicker but i can also go to philadelphia and do what have you and stop in in in in in in in
*  do something something different on the way then and it still get to the same place so there are
*  these multiple ways of signals propagating that i think we get have to become a little bit more
*  familiar with this way of thinking that it's not that everything has a chance to influence everything
*  at the same time and equally well but there are ample opportunities of these signals to
*  crisscross and mutually influence each other in many more ways than a direct inspection of the
*  only strongest connections would indicate so the first principle being this massive
*  anatomical connectivity but really having in mind another of the principles which i think might be
*  number two i can't remember the number but it really is going into a functional space of
*  relationships of these signals you have these signals in the back of the brain in the front of
*  the brain perhaps there's no single one direct connection and there isn't but nonetheless they're
*  functionally coupled in in ways that have to do with the current behaviors that an animal is doing
*  at that time and i think that's the space that we need to move to and i think i feel sometimes that
*  people are a little too bound by the by the anatomy and for instance they they have studies that show
*  oh functional connectivity in the resting state is really well predicted by the structural connectome
*  okay maybe that's true but i'm not going to deny that it's going to constrain and impact it
*  but i think that we have to understand how it goes away from that basic set of functional
*  relationships that are just driven by the sort of the direct pathways the most strong pathways or the
*  ones that are in the more basic context the more context independent ones that a person is there
*  and not doing some active behavior in the scanner just to give one an arbitrary example so i view
*  these two principles as really highly related and i like to emphasize the connectivity one because
*  at least in my way of thinking has really influenced how i've started to think and solidify
*  some of these ideas was by taking the anatomy seriously if the anatomy is like this and we're
*  revealing all these principles of connectivity of anatomical connectivity what are the functional
*  consequences yeah so so you tell the story of small world networks and then relate that within
*  a network neuroscience perspective and and you it used to be thought well because you know small
*  world oh that's optimal for communication and it used to be thought you make the point in the book
*  that the brain is actually connected anatomically in a higher than small world order of magnitude
*  yeah and then so what i want to ask you then you know going back to that combinatorial anatomical
*  connectivity is you know well what does that do for us right and is that where we shift into the
*  functional connectivity story is that an advantage of being more highly
*  more higher than small world network more highly connected than small world network is
*  is that an easy way to shift into thinking about that the importance of the functional connectivity
*  yeah i think i think i think that small world connected the small world organization would
*  already give a lot of those kinds of properties because i think that's why it was so fundamental
*  when olaf's borns and many others started suggesting this in the early 2000s i think
*  it's really fundamental because it really shows that even with a regular structure with a few
*  random long-range connections you start getting properties that all of a sudden emerge in the
*  system that you would not have and you get it from relatively few long-range random connections
*  and which changes drastically the space of functional relationships that are possible
*  in this kind of architecture i think if you take that one step further so i don't have any problem
*  with that but i think that again it's empirical right so that's what we we want it to be we study
*  the brain and we see how does the architecture look and in my view my reading of the literature
*  it's there's some there's some challenges and questions there because of the strength of the
*  connections and all sorts of nuances that we can't ignore but my reading of the literature is that
*  it's actually really more like a tiny world than a small world in the sense that it's denser
*  connectivity in cortex there's these highly structured large-scale loops basal ganglia
*  cerebellum amygdala midbrain that complemented the cortical dense mesh of interconnections
*  so what it what i think it does is that it puts even more pressure i think on us
*  to move to a space of functional relationships because the anatomy is such that you can
*  integrate and you can you can interact and integrate much more easily than we were
*  we thought because of the small world or let's say this is correct and this tiny world hypothesis
*  is flies and and so if it does then then we we really need to to shift spaces because anatomy
*  supports many different kinds of functions because of the ways of communication
*  it's highly efficient in ways that you wouldn't if it was piecemeal you know i have to go to
*  california via every single thing it's gonna it's a lot of steps that you have to take there
*  so it's gonna take weeks months i don't know that you know when america went to the west was months
*  right so it takes months and if you have these shortcuts and these other ways of communicating
*  communicating then it changes changes things dramatically relationships can occur that would
*  not be able to occur otherwise in space and time there's time again principle three neurons as
*  the main unit of the brain just kidding networks as functional units
*  well that's a good point because not too long ago neurons were the human
*  unit and i think yeah i don't know i don't know i think that that one has probably
*  died but i'm not sure yeah but anyway that's not a discussion here today that that i think that
*  putting all these things together i think that really speaks to our need now in neuroscience
*  to focus on circuits so that unit becomes a circuit and what are the principles of the
*  circles that form and why does let's say the fusiform gyrus participate in certain circuits
*  that support face recognition much more often than it participates in perhaps let's say than
*  other circuits that support other kinds of things so that we have to work those things out that has
*  to do with their place in this whole anatomical space and many other kinds of things obviously
*  the sensory kinds of inputs that are more proximal and whatnot but that's the kinds of
*  questions that i think neuroscience should be focusing on are you using circuits and networks
*  synonymously in this in this case that is a problem that i that's a really good question because
*  i've used that synonymously in the past and a lot of people do not like it and i think i
*  probably should be a little bit more careful because i've interchange exchange them
*  and a lot of people view networks almost like perhaps more traditional fmri networks fmri
*  resting state networks right right i never really thought of it that way because i of course it's
*  it's very commonly used that circuits feels like closer to anatomical to me than networks right
*  actually in fact someone recently in something that i submitted for publication i think was
*  saying that it was very confusing and they i think they said the same thing maybe you review the
*  paper that that oh yeah they send them to me because because yeah i think by using circuits
*  i think it semantically connected in this person's mind in this reviewer's mind perhaps something
*  much more structural that i didn't have in mind so i don't know what the best word is then i just
*  don't know because i was too casually using circuit very dynamically and very functionally
*  like these things forming dynamically as a circuit yeah but if the readers the listeners everyone is
*  interpreting this as something more more anatomical and more rigid then it's a really bad way of
*  of referring to them and networks i have had this push back too because i think networks is just
*  people are thinking oh you're thinking about oh and he also does some fmri research so he's always
*  talking about these networks and these fmri resting state networks and and some right two
*  thirds of neuroscience like who cares about fmri research and i i didn't mean it in that sense at
*  all of fmri networks of resting state networks so i think my language there might have been
*  really problematic is throwing people completely off but i do mean i've been using networks and
*  and circuits more or less interchangeably and thinking of these highly dynamic modifiable
*  uh overlapping entities communities um coalitions clusters motif motif perhaps yeah motifs
*  something like so but a motif it doesn't even require something like a circuit motif but
*  i if you say a circuit motif people think yeah that would almost almost sound more structural
*  to me right circuit motif well i thought motif would give it a give it more of a um functional
*  flavor um yeah yeah circuit sounds a connects to b but then motif is like well there's this family
*  of them kind of or something yeah i do i i do think that maybe we need some ways of of conveying
*  that that if these really if there really are these things that form more dynamically that and this
*  this state this this in this time point the amygdala is is is functionally linked with several
*  other regions and that shifts dynamically in in behavior then i think we need to really
*  use better words or or or qualify these words and it could that could be a little bit of explanation
*  sometimes of the difficulty in communication which happens in general with lots of these terms right
*  not to mention these complicated terms like complexity and emergence and what have you
*  and what exactly do we mean right and and even in this more basic sense i think that you might have
*  just spotted something that it can be confusing yeah i should i should be more careful in referring
*  to these things which i view it's as really very dynamic and and malleable all right back on track
*  i suppose principally we have two more principles um principle four interactions via cortical
*  subcortical loops and you know this is harking back to the thalamus and cortical basal ganglia
*  loops and the amygdala loops yeah so that that's really is a principle that is i could have ordered
*  it slightly differently and linked it to the first principle which is the the backbone of of of
*  connectivity but i wanted to literally have a header there that a person would see separate
*  on a piece of paper and and we really drive home this need to be really thinking about
*  the cortical subcortical but even in a more general sense not just the forebrain subcortex but
*  everything below the cortex midbrain and hindbrain with cerebellum that it's really all this
*  connectivity along the entire neural axis that happens to be vertical in humans and horizontal
*  in many other animals that we we that we really should be considering and not so much having the
*  focus which we tend to do i think especially in my part of the world which is more human oriented
*  research of cortex cortex cortex and and in fact deriving what are the principles of of the
*  brain's architecture just from looking at cortical connectivity i mean sometimes i i mean i both
*  admire people who do that and also it drives me crazy because well we can't isolate the cortex
*  from all the other rest all the rest so how can we how can we have even the courage of proposing
*  that the brain architecture is has these properties if we're not taking into account all the other
*  kind of structural arrangements so i wanted to have that a separate heading because i really think
*  it helps organize our thinking and moving away from just maybe connectivity between any given level
*  just calling level here like a cortex subcortex midbrain and just for convenience
*  i roll yeah right so so to break this this this um this this tendency that we think mostly you
*  know how the subcortical regions maybe are interconnected which is a quite a lot of of
*  the animal work right the non-human animal research focuses a lot of on subcortical structures for
*  historical reasons and many reasons and then human work tends to focus a lot on the on the
*  cortical regions and and so breaking a little bit this mode of thinking i thought that i would have
*  this as a separate principle so you describe you know the differences between open loops and closed
*  loops um and give examples of these types of loops in the brain which i like the idea of there being
*  a closed loop as separate from an open loop but everything also comes in degrees and would it be
*  correct to say that as we learn the more we learn about anatomical connectivity the more everything
*  is actually an open loop no i don't think necessarily so because i mean that could be
*  the way that things turn out empirically but i do think that with newer methods right we're always
*  evolving with methods newer methods and new ways of doing these anatomical studies and just redoing
*  them is incredibly important because we really have had we haven't had amazing breakthroughs in
*  doing structural anatomy that have completely revolutionized things that compared to
*  to chemical injections and other kinds of more standard approaches that have been used for many
*  decades and so we're really still learning an incredible amount that we forget sometimes
*  about that but we're still really learning a lot about the the architecture itself the anatomy
*  itself so it really could come to having certain kinds of loops that happen to be more closed
*  more in a closed loop type of of organization in which the initial region projecting
*  it's the region that eventually receives back the the return if you will projections
*  versus something that it has a quite a little bit more quite a lot more of spread indicating that
*  i would support different kinds of functional relationships right so that that the segregation
*  is clearly something that would be more functional segregation would be clearly favored by more
*  parallel isolated circuits parallel circuits than circuits that cross talk and because the emphasis
*  in the past has been a little bit more about their relative independence in the loops i've tried to
*  emphasize in the book that we have been learning quite a bit about the more interactive and
*  overlapping nature of these loops than if we thought perhaps a decade or two ago and so
*  appreciating that because i think is very important but i do think it's it's something
*  it has to be the empirical outcome that we find out okay well we thought was more distributed
*  was because we had some markers that were diffusing in ways that we didn't understand and
*  it's not so open loop at after all it's actually much more closed loop okay great so that's that's
*  the organization and then we have to move forward with that with the understanding that we have at
*  the time but just because something is closed loop so at first blush you might think well that
*  argues more strongly for a modular view of the brain but just because a loop is closed it's not
*  synonymous with modularity because there's a lot of other interactions going on that are not part
*  of the loop because yeah that's interesting thing is that if we we have this habit of doing these
*  basal ganglia loops and these kind of other other loops we have this habit it's a loop right but we
*  have this habit of starting it with in the cortex which is but it's a loop right so we could have
*  stayed we start somewhere else but let's do the same thing and start at the cortex and and so if
*  the if the if the loop was perfectly closed right onto this exact same neuron let's say if the loop
*  is perfectly closed as you said it doesn't mean modular because if that same neuron again if we're
*  going to stick to a single neuron is actually connected in many ways it's it actually has the
*  room for much more distributed processing and non-modular processing even though these loops
*  are closed the closed loops tend to favor a little bit more segregated style of processing
*  i would say but it doesn't preclude it constrains more i think the kind of interaction of the
*  signals i do think that i mean i think that's the overall way that i think about anatomy
*  enabling and constraining the types of relationships that are more natural
*  because if i need to do something within a few seconds it this i can't wait minutes for this
*  thing to percolate and and and go 17 times around every single place in the brain so obviously there
*  are temporal constraints that in behavior thankfully it's not all the time that animals
*  and humans need to engage in something that is so such time pressure but there are those occasions
*  where there are these these these kinds of behavior requirements in time that have to be executed
*  quite rapidly you step on a brake and you have to stop immediately or catch something or what have
*  you that these are many behaviors not to mention more survival related behaviors that we watch on
*  on youtube or what have you that that are that are incredibly time sensitive
*  does an open loop indicate higher complexity or does it indicate a higher decoupling between
*  uh our senses and motor actions not necessarily i suppose
*  i i would i mean again at the first pass i would have to think more carefully but i think i think
*  i i think that more open loops give more opportunities for more crosstalk right so
*  for instance if there's a region that for whatever reason because of its receptor density because of
*  history of learning and other kinds of things is is very important for reward related mechanisms
*  and this is part of some loop that is is very open it it can be influenced by many things and
*  it can influence many other things so it it opens up the space of relationships i think
*  that's my first inclination is to think that way and so at least even in a rapid cycle of things
*  it has the ability to to incorporate more things right because it might be receiving signals from
*  more diverse places that are more sensitive that are sensitive to different aspects of the external
*  and internal worlds and and thereby having supporting more behavioral flexibility because
*  if you're just sensitive to a certain class of signal then i'm more tied to that class of signal
*  but if i can have more signals that let's say just for example a more internal world and more
*  external world simultaneously both worlds can okay do i go and fight well but i was just injured so
*  it's not a good idea right so i was just attacked and this pride of lions and and you've been
*  attacked and your your leg is injured the best behavior right now is to crouch and whatever
*  do behaviorally that is better as opposed to striking back and and i think that these multiple
*  elements of internal and external worlds having the ability to influence behavior the open loops
*  my first inclination is to think that they support the faster versions of these kinds of
*  relationships and behaviors okay louis principle five and then we'll move on to some other topics
*  here um and i'm curious you know whether you felt if this one was just tacked on but i know
*  that this is this is near and dear to your heart also okay principle five connectivity with the
*  body right so connectivity with the body i think that one of the weaknesses to be honest of the book
*  is literally that i didn't develop as much the body into the book as i i in an i looking back
*  ideally i could have i should have because i do think that brains being embodied is fundamental
*  like a lot of people have been talking about this for decades and even more so in the past five
*  ten years so obviously there's no originality whatsoever there i'm just saying the same thing
*  that everyone is saying that a lot of people have been saying so but i do think is really a fundamental
*  principle and if later we get to talk about ai and certain things that ai needs to do i would
*  bring back the body and and but that's that's for later maybe but i do think that this this close
*  link of brain and body is really fundamental and i think that because i wanted to have a book short
*  but i also the book was for a general audience and i have professionally to get grants and papers and
*  whatnot i have to put an end to the project i think i you know in a perfect world i would have
*  had a lot more on the body and really highlighting this aspect which i think is fundamental so in
*  that sense it might have felt like you said was it tacked on so in that sense it might have been
*  appearing that way because of the lack of depth and integration of these ideas throughout the book
*  but i do think it's really well i really i really think that we're missing a lot by
*  by considering this as a disembodied organs brain that is just a brain and that is not
*  closely connected in communicating with with with an acting body and in this embodiment
*  yeah yeah when you talk about interoception but that also just links with behavior which you stress
*  which you stress you know throughout the book as you know that's what it's all about anyway is
*  connecting brain and behavior yeah right exactly um all right we are we got through the five
*  principles so i want to just ask um the way that we've been talking is in terms of which area which
*  regions are connected to which other regions and the functional motifs now i've got to use language
*  and it's awful right but uh but then but this is all like with neuronal um connections and areas
*  you know do you when you think about these things do you also think in terms of neuromodulators
*  and con you know within the context sensitivity astrocytes and and those sorts of system level
*  properties in combination with these or principles of organization it's and so on yeah i i do think
*  in those terms i think it reflects my own lack of sufficient amount of knowledge that i don't have
*  a more comprehensive treatment in in terms broader terms including astrocytes and and and this more
*  in-depth discussions of of neurotransmitter systems and their interactions and their combinations and
*  the way that that that's something that i that i could have explored and included in the book but
*  i do think that it's it's it's really it's really critical and and integral to understanding
*  these systems is that these systems exist in an architecture that is made even more flexible
*  even more powerful given this these modulations that these these these systems afford provide
*  the system in ways that can engage large large large parts of the brain can be more
*  focal sometimes and and so it's really incredibly central to the to the story i think i think that
*  that's something that if i you know some someone i can't not envision this ever happening but
*  if they're an entangled brain version two then that's the direction that it should grow and
*  develop and and work out and in what ways these these these aspects need to be integrated i think
*  that's that's really important so i don't want to make us go down a long path here but you are very
*  interested in connecting brain with behavior and you argue about the complexity of behavior and
*  needing to track that and when i got into neuroscience i was really interested in
*  consciousness whatever the hell that is right and and you know thinking and our mental world
*  is essentially our subjective mental world and i'm wondering if you feel like the you know these
*  principles of organization and these principles of complexity and so on can we extend those you
*  know well here's the question has this changed or made you think about our mental world in
*  in any different way or do you feel like these principles can apply to the mental and we can
*  start to get a grasp on things that aren't quote unquote behavior yeah i do i do think i i think
*  that's clearly a part of the space that i don't explore in my thinking in general it's something
*  that i that i hear that i read sometimes and and a lot of people are interested a lot of people
*  bring like language and other kinds of other kinds of yeah human capabilities at least with
*  this level of how language is developed how developed language is and and whatnot clearly
*  clearly clearly it's clearly the case it's something that i don't bring into to focus
*  in my thinking or or my my focus of research but but it's something that i do think it
*  it's closely related it has to be closely related to to the aspects that we were discussing before
*  essentially you know very loose sense and and kind of hand wavy way is is is there all these these
*  higher order interactions that that that that could afford some mental world and event and and
*  space that that i that needs to be supported in some way because it exists and so we need to make
*  along along that direction i often like you said in many of the papers i i bring these examples from
*  threat processing and other kinds of more basic forms of behavior even if they're highly highly
*  complex might involve certain kinds of at least in the scenarios like foraging scenarios and how
*  the predator and prey and whatnot in some of the discussions that i've that i've that i've written
*  but it doesn't approximate the type of many of the behaviors that many investigators and researchers
*  are really interested in right so that that gets to to your question with these these mental world
*  of imagination of planning of these levels upon levels of further decoupling of sensory stimulation
*  and and current state of the body in in the mental the content of of some mental augmentation and
*  so it's it's something that i that i don't have that i haven't investigated or thought deeply enough
*  from my ins so let's move on to talk about and this is kind of related emotion although you you
*  know you are have been interested in the the connection between cognition and emotion but i
*  suppose you know you mainly focus on the behavior is related to emotion let's talk about emotion
*  and and then i want to bring in ai before we get to some extra time for patreon listeners
*  i just want your take on how the concept of emotion has sort of historically evolved right
*  as we've learned more you know so it used to be emotion is in the amygdala or sub cortex right or
*  something like that and now we have a much more nuanced view of it so how have we come to appreciate
*  emotion in the modern sense based on its historical context yeah so i think that i think that's that's
*  that's a really important important question or theme which is historically
*  so one of the central ideas in in emotion research pertaining to the brain is is that
*  the existence that the suggestion of an existence of a specialized circuit for emotion
*  and even more so than a specialized circuit circuit let's say a more structural circuit
*  a more structured called the fine and constrained circuit for emotion not only that was was a major
*  theme but the presence or the the existence i should say of a specific brain region let's
*  say the hypothalamus as the centerpiece of this little structural circuit for emotion
*  so historically that has been something that has always been emphasized and i think to a good
*  extent it still informs a lot of the debate that there is specificity in the structural circuit
*  a set of regions that are involved and there are some really heavy players hypothalamus amygdala
*  and so on periaqueductal gray and some other favorites of depending on the focus of a research
*  group but so in the animal world there's still in the in the animal research non-human animal
*  research there's still a lot of emphasis on on these players but i think in the past
*  two decades or so with research in humans
*  fmri to a good extent but i think more broadly even conceived it really has informed perhaps
*  strongly a strongly initial push was antonio damasio's decart's error to really suggest
*  these systems at the very least are interacting with other things like perception and cognition
*  in really important ways that for instance decision making is a cognitive emotional process
*  like let's say somatic mark somatic marker hypothesis by damasio and colleagues and so on
*  so i think that really broadened the scope of thinking about emotion in the brain the emotional
*  brain in the past two decades and i think that that is permeating even a little bit into the
*  rodent literature for instance a lot of investigators have been now some investigators i should say are
*  now looking at the role of the anterior insula and i should say that in the past two decades
*  i should say that in the rodent the roles of the medial prefrontal cortex that part of cortex was
*  has been there for quite some time but not a broader view of more players as perhaps in the
*  case of the human research so i guess i guess in summary i think what we're i think we're observing
*  is that it's becoming more natural for people to think of at the very least more interactions
*  between these cognitive emotional systems cognitive action systems cognitive perceptual systems
*  i mean as you know my push is to kind of dissolve these boundaries or
*  heavily blur at the very very least heavily blur these boundaries but i think that there's
*  a wider appreciation of this at the very least of the interactions between these systems so i think
*  emotion research has really evolved tremendously in the past 30 years or 25 years in that direction
*  that the circuits are becoming really hard to to to you look at these reviews and the circuits now
*  have a dozen or two dozen regions and if you if we looked at it and if we if it actually be
*  interesting the number of regions per year or per decade you know plot in a in a graph and people
*  were probably looking at two or three regions and and now they're they're they're showing reviews
*  with with really complex really fascinating set of regions interacting in complex ways for fear
*  learning fear extinction and and their relationships and whatnot
*  steve marron has a review paper it's really fascinating it's like a 70 page review and has
*  these very large these growing circuits now that are becoming more mainstream in neuroscience so i
*  think that it's i think it's it's really important that that this direction of
*  it's not this isolated units anymore it's it's the opposite of isolating right it's bringing
*  together with the rest and i think that it's we still we still draw it though as as kind of units
*  connected to units you know and is there a way around that i mean so you've written a paper where
*  you have kind of you've diagrammed out a functional emotional integrative kind of circuit and that's
*  not so much the box and arrow version so yeah i think that i think another thing that you have
*  speaking about learning how to use language in different ways or learning to do science in a way
*  that it's it's more or less it's it's less context dependent i think another important direction for
*  us as a field and perhaps other fields is to learn to do science that is less boxes and arrows right
*  so somehow if we could because we have to draw these and if we let go of it draw things i think
*  that would be a huge advance already and and not only we have to draw things but sometimes we have
*  to put labels because we're just trying to summarize we're trying to do dimensionality
*  dimensionality reduction on the paper right and so we put one word there but then if we do that one
*  word we ruined everything right because okay that's not what we meant or maybe we did mean that
*  word but is that what you really meant or you meant i don't know what you meant but i think
*  you meant i don't know what did you mean exactly so but i think that dimensionality reduction is so
*  extreme that how do we go i mean we can't have a plot with a cloud of a word cloud around surrounding
*  and rotating and spinning i don't know but but is that a problem i sometimes i do think so that i
*  just don't want to even do a figure because it's just going to ruin the whole idea it limits the
*  concept conveyed yeah yeah and we that's the concept that we're conveying and obviously
*  we're not going to perhaps there are other ways that are even available now but for
*  a regular small lab completely beyond anyone's means to generate a movie to explain some of
*  these ideas and some complex computer graphics manipulation 3d glasses yeah the i-max movies
*  for every paper some visualization that is super fancy perhaps that even exists but
*  the we don't that science is not like that yet perhaps it needs to be a little bit more
*  maybe when we develop a gi they can just we can just tell them to do that for us right but will
*  they have uh emotions so you've written you've written that there's a need for uh artificial
*  intelligence to incorporate emotions how's that for a segue by the way that's pretty good
*  that is that's a good one that's a perfect one that's i do think that if
*  if we want to of course we can have we can have a computer science we can have a
*  artificial intelligence that is completely different from how humans do things it's it's
*  fine right so we can we do obviously complex mathematics that is is not just how we or logic
*  or what have you it's not the way we reason it's it's it's it's completely fine it's it's not
*  there's nothing inconsistent with with trying ways of formalizing knowledge systems or or
*  uh artificial artificial intelligence in ways that are completely different
*  but if we want to solve problems that are similar to what embodied animals solve
*  in intelligent ways i think we need to solve a couple of problems that bring us to emotion and
*  here's my way of thinking my way of thinking is that like let's say we think to make this concrete
*  and just how it helps me is to think about a robot right so a brain a robot has a brain
*  and it moves around and so if it does that it needs to we would like to send to
*  perhaps mars is not a good analogy anymore because of things that i don't even want to get into but
*  we said we want to send some some expedition some some spacecraft to another planet or some some
*  other something yeah right so we need to solve it it needs to be an autonomous agent right it needs
*  to be it needs to survive it to be autonomous so so i think the problem to be solved for the kinds
*  of intelligence that we engage in and other animals engage in there might be other kinds
*  of intelligence that are fascinating as well but these kinds of intelligence really requires us
*  to solve the the the behavioral autonomy problem which is how do you build a system that is
*  completely autonomous and can behave flexibly and intelligently in complex unpredictable worlds
*  so that the rules are completely
*  they're flexible enough that they pose sufficient challenges to to an agent so in that setting i
*  think that we really need to have agents that can have both motivation and emotion in the sense of
*  learning what is of biological significance in that case obviously not biological so but what
*  we call biological significance in that case for agent it's it's it's significant to the agent
*  that it needs to conserve some kind of energy because its battery will run out and it needs to
*  find some source of what have you some source of some nutrient or i don't know what and
*  and it needs to navigate in certain ways so certain things have value in in that in that way because
*  of its the integrity of the agent that will not be maintained if it does not consider those factors
*  so i think emotion and motivation come very naturally to organize behavior even behavior
*  that is thought to be historically has been thought to be independent of these factors
*  not necessarily perception planning and in general problem solving have to incorporate these factors
*  and i think these factors are incorporated in ways that we call emotion and emotion and motivation
*  in biological systems and so that's my label you can call it whatever we want and it's a label
*  and i think it's a really a way of summarizing the existential and survivals in the in the
*  survival sense of agents that exist in a in a in a flexible and unpredictable world of limited
*  resources right so you can't just turn yourself off and beam some new energy source and then
*  you turn yourself back on it turns yourself it turns it turns you on back on it's something that
*  in the in these kinds of scenarios i think it has to be solved perhaps to navigate worlds that are
*  not limited by factors such as space and time in ways that biology faces and limited resources
*  perhaps the games kind of change and so maybe we we can we can get by with many kind of other
*  architectures and maybe it will surprise us that we can get a lot more done by just brute force
*  we have such astronomical computational power now compared to what we had 50 years ago
*  i mean what was going to happen in 50 years so if we have a lot of the problems that we've been
*  solving in many ways are largely driven by computational power right it's like brute force
*  brute force in the sense that we have i don't know about trillion parameters and we have unlimited
*  energy and we have and we have time in our hands but and so maybe that's going to be available and
*  if that's available then we don't need a solution that is if functions on whatever the i have no
*  idea if it's it's it's a reliable estimate or whatever number of watts the brain consumes per
*  unit of time exactly 20 yeah exactly 20 right so it is not going to work on on that kind of setting
*  but who cares if that's not the setting in which the things are operating but i think that
*  in many problems that involve autonomy that will have to be part of the solution or or at the very
*  least that would be really useful a really useful part of the solution i believe it's my my my
*  my take on this one of the things that you just mentioned a moment ago is you know it doesn't
*  really matter what you call it it's a label right and let's say the word emotion maybe what we
*  should have said sort of you know up ahead is we've been talking about how the modular view of the
*  brain should sort of dissipate and eventually allow this other way of thinking that we've been
*  discussing here but you know are we still comfortable using the word you know in the
*  are we still comfortable using the word emotion because that word itself it has a conceptual
*  space that historically at least in western culture is associated with things like weakness
*  or frivolity or non-usefulness but as we learn more about you know let's say the emotional
*  circuit motifs and the integration of emotion with cognition and its importance does that change our
*  conception of emotion enough you know or do we you know those boundaries of concepts do they need
*  to be kind of blurred as well i think i think that's a really great point i really like that
*  because i think it has been changing right so i think that you know when you started saying this
*  i it took me a fraction of a second to update things and so yeah of course you're right because
*  historically that's how emotion has been conceptualized in we literature and in society
*  and but i do think that in the past 30 40 years i guess it's let's say 30 years with
*  books by by joe le do and by damasio and by many others i do think that it's actually going it could
*  be going i'm not sure that's a great question actually i think it could be going in a way that
*  is is changing the way that we see it and see it in a way that for instance if we take some of the
*  let's say just say that damasio ideas that is integral to decision making so it becomes the
*  connotation becomes very different right and so we start thinking of it as as an intelligent thing
*  to do and so if you were if you were to eliminate that that factor that is so important determining
*  am i going to go all the way to the west boston to do a phd and i'm going to leave all my family
*  all my friends here back in this other country i mean the flight is super long as i am a graduate
*  student have no money that's not going to maximum one time a year i'm going to be able to see
*  i mean how do you the decision there is is humans at least is highly complex right it's not just oh
*  i'm going to increase my knowledge of artificial neural networks and computational neuroscience
*  it's so that way of deciding in so far as we think that it is
*  use it's improved some kinds of decision making obviously some kinds of decision making
*  are not improved by humans how humans fail miserably i think it's pretty obvious in ways
*  of using types of decision making that that are influencing by factors that are clearly detrimental
*  at least if we think of you know the greater some greater good of all the the beings on the planet
*  as opposed to a sub a small subgroup but but if we think that that is beneficial in some context
*  then i do think it shifts the boundaries of the concepts themselves and we start thinking
*  of start valuing people who have i don't know what to call it i don't even know exactly how
*  it's conceptualized but call it emotional intelligence or what have you i don't you know so
*  i what about emotional train wrecks what should we do with those people
*  so yeah well yeah exactly so it is it is it is messy we talked about emotion and um it's
*  um usefulness in artificial systems but what about the other kind of principles that we've been
*  talking about that you write about in your book you know these do you think that the art ai world
*  let's say is appreciating these kinds of principles that are being more appreciated
*  and more discovered in our brains you know the interactions between systems the interactions the
*  loops and the openness and closeness of loops i mean are do these principles need to be built
*  into ai and do you think they're being appreciated enough i do i i i don't think they're appreciated
*  enough and i think it's fine i mean well i should i should put it this way i think i mean we have
*  finite resources and so if you want to stick to one style of computation if you will it's
*  fine let's build things that have these abstract parameterizations and transformers and whatnot
*  that we can build things and understand the underlying mathematics eventually and and do things
*  or what have you you can have you can have one style of doing things it's it's i think it's fine
*  but i think that what i find very interesting is that
*  some groups are starting to pay attention you know one group that always comes to mind is a large
*  group so i'm not going to need to name any specific it's a in montreal to me comes pops to mind as a
*  hub of people who kind of integrating these ideas much more stronger than perhaps i mean as an
*  outsider so i could be wrong but it feels to me that i'm always hearing something from from those
*  groups so many many groups that becomes a hub for thinking about how we can how can neuroscience
*  kind of give us some architectural ideas or themes or motifs that that can can be interesting so
*  okay so i don't have just one recurrent neural network one rnn but i have multiple rnns and okay
*  and now i have to work out how they're going to interact and and so
*  so i think it opens the space of architectures in ways that i as a completely
*  a fictionado about the brain find fascinating because i want to understand in what ways maybe
*  some of these principles could could open up ways of thinking about distributed processing
*  computation more generally and i think that it could turn out that that that they turn out to be
*  very beneficial for ai for general for let's say general intelligence and
*  it could right so i just don't know because if you it could be the system the system could benefit
*  from some of these things but only modestly unless we take it to a much more further elements of the
*  architecture and perhaps the embodiment and and even the fact that that animals have a long
*  the mammals have a really long development phase they spend years many it's not just humans that
*  they can't they wouldn't be able to survive on their own by any means so it's a really
*  really different kind of solution to this problem i have a create something that depends on
*  supervision not in the supervision supervised learning sense but on on someone
*  literally taking care of it for for years so what if that is part of a really important type of
*  solution that that that evolved and so we don't know but i think that yeah to me as a basic
*  scientist and my with my origins in computer science i i would be fascinating if we had
*  more space to investigate those things too that would be that i find extremely attractive
*  that that type of scenario just to understand not necessarily i'm a little more skeptical about
*  i'm to put it mildly sometimes i'm more skeptical about the ways in which these architectures will
*  inform us about the brain but i view them more as abstract architectures that we would gain a lot
*  to understand even from a computer science or call it whatever discipline i mean again names
*  of disciplines are this one thing yep useless is all everything yeah yeah exactly i mean i i was
*  never i was in the computer science department and i like biology i mean i'm a psychology department
*  i didn't have a biology a psychology class and so yeah it's yeah for me it doesn't work but
*  but i think it would be so fascinating to to to to study these kinds of things and if they can
*  inform the brain because inform our understanding of the brain so much the better i think that
*  that i'm open to that possibility as well as long as it's a real collaboration right people are
*  really interested in in in in really understanding these systems and real really real interdisciplinary
*  collaboration multidisciplinary so i i really want to understand the biology and the behavior
*  and i always i also want to understand the computational principles distributed processing
*  parallel distributed processing types of architectures and how these things communicate interact
*  with each other at a at a at a high level at a broader level conceptual level but with the
*  details of the disciplines right it's the same that if if someone gets into this and doesn't know
*  underlying computer architecture and distributed systems doesn't know that
*  it's a little separate from ai i'm just talking more even more broadly now so i think that that
*  these two collaborations i think would be would be fascinating so i think there's a lot of room
*  for for those and i think that so i mean just literally yesterday i bumped into a paper of
*  saying what happens to i don't even know what it exactly means i have to read it it's like what
*  happens with um what happens to a spatially constrained i don't know if you saw it was
*  literally a spatially constrained rnn and so what emerges what let's use another word what happens
*  to a spatially constrained rnn recurrent neural network when it literally is spatially constrained
*  so it's insights it's not just an abstract oh so i literally have to i i was like okay i'm
*  i bookmarked it i want to read it i want to see what it is so if you start putting a physical
*  constraint to the number of connections or the size or i don't even know what they exactly did
*  but they had a thread on mastodon and it seemed fascinating because they were they were saying
*  that we're finding all sorts of things that happen when you spatially constrained
*  constrained on rnn okay yeah i mean i vaguely remember this but maybe something maybe it was
*  like a year ago or something okay maybe there was another version or you know an early maybe
*  got published now and it was like for the first three and i had i noticed just literally just
*  yesterday i think it was still a pre-print yesterday but uh in fact i'll just send you the link but
*  please do i just as an example the kinds of things right so that's why i find it so fascinating i
*  want to put brains i mean if we could clone ourselves right and have multiple careers at
*  the same time it's like working in robotics and put a physical what if we build this thing and
*  this thing has to navigate in the world right so what i mean what do we learn from from doing that
*  from so my suggestion is that cognitive emotional interactions have to be integral
*  to this architecture the cognitive emotion integration has to be integral to this
*  architecture and not something that is kind of uh you have a traditional cognitive
*  architecture and you add a layer that you call emotion because it has some kind of
*  right neuromodulatory low pass thing that tracks you know how many positive and how negative how
*  many negative things happen in its past one hour and it modulates a little bit how i don't know
*  how fast it moves or how fast it it it answers a question i don't i don't think that that's
*  that's the way to go i think that we need to has to be much more integrated
*  and i think that that offers a lot more room for diversity of of processing that then then the
*  segregated view but again that's obviously something that uh it's it's it's it's not
*  in this case it's not empirical you have to construct and compare that you know compete
*  the two types of architectures and see what they end up doing so believe me i would rather spend
*  so believe me i would rather spend another half hour with you than go do what i'm about to do
*  which is uh try to teach children uh things a guitar and such but anyway i've got to go be a
*  parent and i've taken you long enough as well but um louise i really i didn't say this up front but
*  i really enjoyed the book and i think it's a great book especially for a more general um
*  uh audience more more general readership because many of the books that i read um you know that
*  people i have on the podcast is a little more specialized so i think you you really hit the
*  nail on the head there so congratulations on that looking forward to entangled part two when that
*  comes out and uh i really enjoyed the conversation so thanks thank you so much that means a lot thanks
