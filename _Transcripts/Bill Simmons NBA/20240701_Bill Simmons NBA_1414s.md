# Paul George Swapping the Clippers for the Sixers | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvWV3erkZto)
*  I want to start with Paul George.
*  I was thinking about how last decade we really mastered this NBA free agency
*  thing where like every year it was like, uh, LeBron and 14 and then it was like
*  Lamarcus Aldridge and 15 and Durant and Horford and 16 and Blake Griffin and
*  Hayward and Millsap and 17 LeBron and Chris Paul and Paul George and 18 and
*  then 19 Kawaii, KD, Kyrie, Horford, Butler, Kemba, D'Angelo Russell.
*  It was just a smorgasbord.
*  And then somehow this decade, the big prize in 20 was Hayward.
*  The big prize in 21 was DeRozan.
*  The big prize in 22 was Beal, Levine and Jalen Brunson, who actually turned
*  out to be a real prize, but we didn't realize it last year was Kyrie and
*  Fred Van Blee and Dylan Brooks.
*  And this year it's Paul George who's been in our lives a long time.
*  Really good player.
*  I voted for him for third team all NBA.
*  I had Clipper season tickets the last five years at no point during those
*  five years that I'd tell my kids, let's drive down to Staples, Paul George's plan.
*  But he's a really good player.
*  He became the prize of free agency.
*  Is this a Clipper story or a Sixer stories for you?
*  I think it's a Sixer story.
*  And first of all, I felt like you were downplaying Paul George with
*  several players, current GOAT.
*  So don't talk bad about the third GOAT.
*  Is that true?
*  Yeah.
*  Several guys said Paul George is their GOAT.
*  Brandon Miller said Paul George is the GOAT.
*  And then we thought it was kind of joking, but there's several players like,
*  no, Paul George is the GOAT.
*  There's a certain window when you were coming up that Paul George was just
*  cooking, I assume with the Pacers and people think he's the GOAT.
*  Interesting.
*  On, on, on ironically.
*  So Paul George is the GOAT in some people's eyes.
*  I assume this is a Sixer story and I don't think he could go anywhere
*  else that makes me happy.
*  Well, cause Orlando took Orlando took themselves off the table with
*  Contavious Caldwell Pope, which made Saruti happy as hell.
*  But now that I'm the Caldwell.
*  That's a, well, that's another story from my nuggets that I'm kind of upset.
*  We'll get into that later.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  I assume Paul George is going to Philadelphia.
*  He's been on this low key ring chase since he left Indiana, where I always
*  thought another story was like, Oh, do you think if he
*  if he goes ringless, let's say just fast forward Paul George's career.
*  If he goes ringless, do you think that he looks back and says, you know what?
*  I could have been like Reggie Miller.
*  I could have been the next guy in Pacers history and just been a one team guy
*  and just been a legend and got a statue right now.
*  Paul George is just roaming statu-less and ringless.
*  It's a bad combo to be statu-less and ringless.
*  And oddly also the goat and also representative of kind of what his
*  generation is where guys bounce around now and they don't stay with the team.
*  So in a weird way, he makes sense for where we've been.
*  I see you're mentioning all this Paul George, big picture stuff.
*  And you hit on something that I don't think he takes enough, enough poo poo
*  for whereas Kevin Durant takes all the poo poo, but Paul George has been
*  pretty like bouncy around ish, right?
*  Going back to Indiana that last year ends up in OKC.
*  Then it's like, oh no, he really wants to play for the Lakers.
*  Then all of a sudden he's resigning with OKC.
*  Then a year later, it's like, would you like, would you, would you be
*  cool if we traded the Clippers?
*  He's like, I'd love it.
*  That'd be great.
*  And now he's not staying with the Clippers when I thought the whole time
*  he just wanted to be in LA cause he's from here.
*  And now he's going to Philly, I guess to chase a ring and there's like some
*  weird lack of respect piece too, cause they didn't give him one extra year.
*  He's 34.
*  Oh, I didn't, I didn't read the lack of respect thing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's a big piece of this.
*  Oh, I didn't write, four years.
*  I'll give him four years.
*  He's Paul George.
*  You're giving Kawhi years.
*  You gave him part in two years.
*  Well, the Cooper's put out this big statement today about why they
*  couldn't come to terms with him.
*  They put it out like 20 minutes before we started taping.
*  It was this bizarre little, I don't know who wrote it.
*  It felt like bomber wrote it.
*  And then like a PA kind of spruced it up, but it was basically like with this new
*  apron and everybody's just going to blame the new apron and we'll talk about
*  Denver and some of these other things.
*  Oh, the apron.
*  So afraid of the apron.
*  Can I ask you a question about the apron?
*  How much do I have to care about the apron?
*  Can I just watch basketball and enjoy free agency?
*  Or do I have to dig in and be a, be a pro bono lawyer and learn about
*  the second apron and the first apron?
*  It's just, it's almost where I, I take a right turn off the basketball fandom.
*  You just don't want to be second.
*  Second apron locks down some decisions in the wrong ways.
*  And I think if you're going second apron, you got to feel awesome about your team.
*  Which to me, we have to win a championship.
*  We're going second.
*  Or second apron.
*  You're like, you're the Celtics.
*  And you're like second apron.
*  We went 80 and 21 last year.
*  And if we bring back these six guys with some role players, we're probably going
*  to keep contending for the title.
*  Let's pay the second apron.
*  If you're the Clippers, you've had this Paul George run where he was there for five years.
*  2020 bubble round two lost to Denver and seven 21 made it all the way to round three.
*  Coag, uh, coag gets hurt, but they lose to Phoenix 2022.
*  No playoffs.
*  2023 Paul George was hurt.
*  Round one lost to Phoenix.
*  2024, coag was hurt.
*  Round one lost to Dallas.
*  So they won three playoff series in five years and we're fun intermittently for
*  little tiny stretches, but for the most part, I don't think anybody really will
*  remember this Clipper load management.
*  Coag era fondly.
*  Do you?
*  No.
*  It was half a decade.
*  Yeah, no, they're still like far behind lob city as far as fun Clippers teams.
*  I don't know.
*  They might even be behind Quinton Richardson and Darius miles.
*  Whatever that season was.
*  I could buy.
*  I'll buy that.
*  I just, I never believed in the Clippers.
*  I know there's pockets of the NBA that believed in the Clippers.
*  I just never thought they were going to do anything other than be middle of the pack
*  in the West and get bounced.
*  But then there was that moment last, there was that moment last year when they were
*  like, Oh my God, the Clippers.
*  I know, but did you really believe in the Clippers?
*  I was one of the last holdouts because I just don't trust James Harden.
*  I didn't trust Kauai's health and it felt like belatedly that was the right thing.
*  But there was a moment there.
*  What were they like 26 and five?
*  I just never killed the Celtics in Boston.
*  Um, with the Paul George thing though, one first team, OMBA five, third
*  team, OMBA is nine all-stars.
*  He was the number three MVP in 2019.
*  He's made the conference finals three times.
*  Since 2016 when his first season, when he came back from the broken leg, 24, six
*  and four, almost 40% from three.
*  And yet he's 34.
*  And I read that Quipper statement.
*  I'm like, I don't really blame him.
*  You're you're for this.
*  He's going to be over 50 million.
*  It's going to be 38 years old.
*  Can I read you the names from his draft?
*  Most minutes from his draft, Paul George, number one, 29,000.
*  Here's the rest of the list descending order of minutes played.
*  Gordon Hayward, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, DeMarcus Cousins, Derek Favors, Evan
*  Turner, Avery Bradley, Al Farouk Aminu, Greg Monroe, Patrick Patterson, Ed Davis.
*  He's like the last guy from his draft.
*  So if I'm the Quippers and I'm like, Oh man, we couldn't even make it out of
*  round one this year with this team.
*  We're, we're going to go all in for four more.
*  I kind of see it from their perspective.
*  I don't like it.
*  I mean, we ran a graphic the other day.
*  I pulled up his basketball reference that he had, he shot 91% from the line.
*  He shot 52%.
*  These are all career highs.
*  What'd he shoot last year?
*  Three.
*  Yeah.
*  And he shot 41% of it.
*  So career high and three point percentage, uh, two, uh, free throw
*  percentage and two point percentage.
*  So overall, a little percentage.
*  I mean, is there a chance that he's like, all right, so you're not going to get the
*  old slashing Paul George, Pacers, Paul George, a little thunder Paul George, but
*  you're going to get raw shooter and can't miss from the free throw line.
*  Paul George, little extension of his career.
*  So you don't have to worry about so many like mile, like, you know, 22,
*  you're basically getting a way better Tobias Harris, maybe 22 to 23 a game.
*  Really good shooting percentages can play defense and has been in a bunch of big
*  games and at least for two years, which is effectively your window of the beat.
*  I mean, Philly has to do this.
*  They don't have a choice.
*  What are they going to do?
*  They have, they're on the clock with Embiid in general.
*  They, they, they all in.
*  How much, how much, how open is Embiid's window in your mind?
*  For in what respect?
*  So I'm like being the guy, like by saying how open is his window?
*  At what point, if you were running the sixes, where you're like, you know what?
*  Our window is now closing pretty tight.
*  Like, are you already in the closing part?
*  I mean, MVP, and then the window starts to close.
*  I guess I don't see him making, is he playing the, you know, a hundred games?
*  I don't know.
*  You play 90 games to get to a final.
*  He turns 30 this season.
*  He's never had a truly memorable playoff moment.
*  He's had a bunch of different injuries.
*  He has a bunch of, you know, bad stuff to his body in the rear view mirror.
*  That's not great.
*  That never ages well.
*  He's the center.
*  There's stuff to be worried about.
*  And if you're, if you're Darrell, you're just thinking, you know, you pulled off
*  this hardened thing where hard and only wanted to go to one team, you somehow got
*  enough assets to at least like stay competitive until Embiid got hurt last season.
*  Then you basically have the illusion of hope with your fans, with the cap space.
*  Like, no, no, we got cap space.
*  Fans are like, yeah, we got cap space.
*  We're gonna be able to get somebody.
*  And then they actually got somebody.
*  It worked out.
*  You think like going back to Ben Simmons, missing those free throws in Atlanta and
*  that thing cratering, turning Ben Sims into James Harden, that thing craters.
*  Then James Harden feuds with Philly and Darrell.
*  He knew he wants out that craters.
*  They have to trade them.
*  They get this cap space stuff back.
*  Usually this doesn't work out, but the bigger question to me is, is, is this the
*  right fit slash city for Paul George?
*  Because this is he played in Indiana, played in OKC, and he played for the
*  black sheep Clippers in LA where it's all Lakers all the time and the Clippers are
*  kind of over there unless they're doing well.
*  And now he's going to Philly where I think how many, what is there like 26ers
*  podcast?
*  This is 24 seven.
*  This is the moment anything goes wrong.
*  People get mad.
*  Are you counting Paul George's podcast as one of those?
*  Now it's 21.
*  Are sixers podcast upset that he's taking sixers mind share?
*  Like, do you think he called Tobias Harris?
*  He's like, hey, Tobias, can you tell me about Philly?
*  No, no.
*  Well, Tobias, don't disappear.
*  Don't get paid a ton of money and disappear.
*  Right.
*  You'll be fine.
*  I think that's what Tobias Harris would do.
*  He'll play hard.
*  He shows up.
*  Like he played 74 games last year.
*  He's going to play hard and I think he's going to work with him.
*  Be I think it works.
*  I just, I think it works on paper.
*  Well, cause the, this Darrell, and I've talked about this in the past where he
*  has this three star theory, right?
*  This has always been how is ever since he had Trace immigrating and yeah, it's
*  like, if I could just get three stars, like that's basically what the Celtics did.
*  And now there's so much talent in the league.
*  I don't know if it's two stars and a lot of depth or whatever it is, but just
*  fundamentally when Maxie turns into a star and you still have been beat and you
*  have this cap space, you're just keeping your fingers crossed basically from
*  February on that something bad happens with another star that you can sign.
*  Right?
*  So Paul George was the logical candidate forever.
*  They lose in round one and still like, well, they're not going to lose him.
*  They're, you know, Kawhi who knows if he's playing like, um, but it somehow worked
*  out and if you're six years, you have to do it.
*  I am not being critical at all.
*  I just wonder from a Paul George standpoint, this now becomes a big.
*  Home run or disaster with no in between, whereas the Clippers, he could
*  have just chugged along, made one more thing and basically Kawhi gets blamed
*  if it doesn't work out.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  But he's just gonna, I don't know if I'm Paul George, I kind of want to
*  take a shot at some point.
*  Right.
*  Like he's not doing like the Clippers are not winning the championship and he knows
*  it, so I actually like it like, like, why don't I go to the East?
*  Why don't I go to Philadelphia and try to win?
*  I like it.
*  His legacy is so for, for knowing him as long as we have, his legacy is
*  still very much in pencil.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  It's what's the defining Paul George moment, some bad playoff games, dunking
*  on, dunking on LeBron when he was, you know, 21 or something like, well, so
*  the Clipper fans would say it was the Utah series, the last couple of games
*  after Kawhi went out when Paul George went to a whole other level.
*  That was, yes.
*  Theoretically is the perfect third guy to play with Maxey and, and in B because
*  you want, you know, he can be a stretch for, for them.
*  He could also, he could play two, three or four.
*  So you can basically, he can Swiss army knife, any of those positions, a little
*  like Jalen Brown at the Celtics, he can, he can handle the ball a little bit for
*  them.
*  They can play Maxey off the ball.
*  He gives them protection during the game.
*  You know, and B it's going to have the 20 game stretch when he's just out for
*  like a month.
*  Um, and he's been in a lot of big playoff games.
*  So for them, it's, it's the all time.
*  No brainer.
*  Cause plan B was basically clay Thompson and Naji Marshall.
*  You know, it's, it's, you, you just in that.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, you like, you're in on clay.
*  I'm waiting on clay.
*  You're in on revenge clay.
*  I'm in on leadership clay.
*  This is how you win clay a little, a little revenge play, but I don't think
*  that clay plays well.
*  Are we switching clay?
*  No, I don't think that play.
*  Okay.
*  I'll save my clay will play.
*  Well, angry.
*  I think clay needs to find another level of joy.
*  Clay only plays well happy and he's, he can't play resentful.
*  I don't think he can play vengeful, but happy clay.
*  If you, if we get happy clay, yeah, I'm very big on happy clay.
*  I feel that way about myself.
*  Happy situations.
*  I just produce better.
*  Yeah.
*  Play with joy podcasts with joy, podcasting with the vengeance.
*  It doesn't, doesn't play it.
*  It takes her anger.
*  A little pessimistic.
*  It doesn't work tearing your Jersey, getting into fights in the
*  first quarter doesn't work.
*  Can we play a conciliary with, with Paul George?
*  Yes.
*  He had to this point he has not signed yet, but it seems like he's done with
*  the Clippers, but Paul George calls us.
*  He's like, yo Clippers won't give me four, four years max.
*  Philly's like dying to give it to me.
*  I really love living in Southern California.
*  I've enjoyed being on the Quippers.
*  Do you think I, I go back East and I throw myself into this Celtics,
*  Sixers bucks hornets nest where now once and for all people, people are going to
*  know about me as a player or I could just glide over here and I'll, we'll have
*  made $500 million and done a bunch of great stuff and I can just enjoy my life.
*  Or I, I'm going to do this.
*  It sounds like we're both like, man, just, just know what you're getting into, but
*  yeah, dude, this is what I would say.
*  I'd say Paul, first thing I want you to do.
*  I want you to watch several of them.
*  I want you to watch three Rocky movies, three Rocky movies.
*  You start with one and then you can pick two other ones.
*  Yeah.
*  And I w I want you to really start feeling Philadelphia.
*  Then I want you to put on some Meek Mill dreams and nightmares, start to get fired
*  up. And then when you sign with Philadelphia, I want you to buy a Philly's hat.
*  I want you to go, go to a Philly's game.
*  And that's a way to sort of you embrace Philly right away.
*  The creeds, my favorite movie.
*  I've watched Creed a hundred times.
*  You got to go all in very quickly.
*  I'm I, I, I, this is a great sports city.
*  I'm new here.
*  We had some good battles when I was with the Pacers, but I, I, I'm so happy to be
*  a Sixer also call Iverson.
*  Do go, maybe go to the Phillies game with Iverson.
*  Have Iverson on your podcast.
*  Great.
*  Great.
*  And then you have to have Philly month on the pod.
*  I want Philly people to row.
*  I want you to hit the ground running.
*  And the person I'm taking this from is Drake May.
*  All of a sudden, Drake May at the Celtics, at the Celtics game, Drake May wearing red
*  socks hats.
*  Like great Drake May.
*  This is exactly what I want.
*  You come in like, yeah, Celtics, I'm here.
*  Like perfect.
*  You would have, you would have been, uh, you know, at a Wizards game if the
*  commander's drafted you, but now you're a hundred percent in on the Celtics.
*  Boom.
*  Hit the ground run.
*  It's a great point.
*  Drake May day after he gets drafted, shows up with all his brothers and his girlfriend
*  from the seventh grade and said, I wanted you to meet everybody because this is who
*  you get when you get me.
*  And this is who you're going to have in your life for the next 15 years.
*  The six of us.
*  I was like, I'm in.
*  I also need six Celtics jerseys.
*  Six kids.
*  Just give me every guy gets a different player.
*  So Paul George, you're right.
*  Because the Philly fans, they've been hurt.
*  They're bitter.
*  She's a bitter, bitter fan base, but sometimes those are the tough loved ones
*  that actually like, you just gotta kind of win them over and just get it.
*  So he just needs to embrace the Philly thing.
*  It can't be anything.
*  If he comes out of the gate and he says, I never wanted to leave LA.
*  I love Southern California.
*  I'm from there.
*  Don't this is such a tough call.
*  Like it's just spin it forward, spin it forward.
*  I've always admired the city of Philadelphia when I come here, the passion of the fans.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  I thought the way you guys treated Ben Simmons, like he deserved it.
*  Well, that's I have a, I have a special Ben Simmons take coming up.
*  Oh, good.
*  I think that just, and I know you have flippers season season tickets.
*  Yeah, unfortunately it's, it's, it's a Lakers town.
*  And I think that he would enjoy the idea of a city being that passionate
*  about a team that he's playing for.
*  Oh, this is good.
*  So he could say one of the reasons I had to leave LA, the city belongs to the Lakers.
*  I wanted to go to a place that lives and breeze and dies with the basketball team.
*  I just missed that.
*  I had an in Indiana.
*  I had an OKC.
*  I just never felt it.
*  And then you're like consulting the Clippers too.
*  It's a little, it's a little shot.
*  It's like a quick shot.
*  And then it's, but it doesn't feel like that big of a shot.
*  Cause if someone came back and was like, am I wrong?
*  Is it a Clippers city?
*  Yeah.
*  Let's be honest.
*  LeBron owns LA, the Lakers own LA.
*  We're just over here.
*  I'm just being honest.
*  Now I'm in Philly.
*  I do feel like there's, he could also like floated out a little bit like James
*  Harden, not fun to play with.
*  Like just maybe second, not directly tied to him, but it's like one of those, it's
*  in a story three days from now.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's like, you can do that via maxi compliments.
*  Like, wow, this guy's just loves the game here every day.
*  Yeah.
*  With your infectious joy.
*  I think about making me better.
*  It's nice to play somebody who's thinking about making me better.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, to put a bow on this Clippers thing, I'm not ready to call it the most
*  catastrophic NBA trade of this century because I think it was the Brooklyn
*  Celtics trade, which isn't totally the fault of the trade because Prokhorov
*  does that trade and then a year later, it just basically says we're not spending
*  money anymore after they had gone all in.
*  I do feel like if he had just kept spending money that Tatum Brown doesn't
*  happen, like none of this stuff happens that happens with that trade.
*  It's really like a fluke.
*  This trade was pricey when it happened.
*  They gave up SGA.
*  Nobody knew he was going to be SGA.
*  They gave up four first and two swaps and another pick.
*  And just already, even if I'm not going to just read all the stuff that's in it,
*  but already, okay, so you got SGA and Jalen Williams from this trade.
*  So already it's a disaster, right?
*  And if, and if from a Clippers standpoint, you're like, yeah, but they won the title.
*  And like the way the Lakers fans talk about the Davis trade.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we did win in 2020.
*  We got, you know, we won the title.
*  We made the Western finals two years later.
*  Um, there is a remaining 2025 swap with OKC where Presti is now like doing the
*  evil doctor, Dr.
*  Evil laugh.
*  And then there's still a 2026 unprotected first left.
*  If there's still an unprotected assets left in this trade and.
*  It it's moving up the ladder.
*  I'll just say that it's really bad.
*  It's a really, really tough one.
*  The SGA piece alone, the franchise, but it's just SGA in a second rounder.
*  It's a disaster.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, wow, I trade SGA.
*  Nevermind unprotected first 2026.
*  And a swap next year.
*  Like what happens if Kawhi just misses next year and then James Harden does the
*  James Harden thing and all of a sudden now they're like the 13 seed in the West.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the lottery and then lottery hits.
*  Really tough.
*  And.
*  You know, I'm sure they didn't make the decision lately.
*  The other piece with it is that they trade for Harden who they signed today for
*  30, 35 million a year for two years.
*  I'm not saying they picked James Harden over Paul George, but when you trade all
*  that stuff for James Harden, then he's the one you end up keeping.
*  So now you basically traded Paul George.
*  The first that you gave up in calf space for James Harden, which is a bad trade.
*  And then today they signed Kevin Porter Jr., which I was just like, what are you
*  guys doing?
*  They do Clippers just seem like they're the old Clippers again, but this is like,
*  this is why the team's been cursed since it moved to Southern California.
*  It's never worked out ever with this team.
*  Not great.
*  I'm glad that you have season tickets though, but not great.
*  I'm not glad I have season tickets.
*  Well, you should have just, I mean, at this point you should just get Lakers
*  tickets.
*  No, I can't.
*  No.
*  Stop.
*  Let's just, it's a better environment.
