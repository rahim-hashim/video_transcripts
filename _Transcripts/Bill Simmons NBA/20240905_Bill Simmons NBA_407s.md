# Charles Barkley on how the WNBA has Failed with Caitlin Clark  The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCpTWIV4y2c)
*  These ladies and I'm a WNBA fan
*  It's been good. They couldn't they cannot have fucked this Caitlin Clark thing up any worse if they tried
*  If you got people in a room
*  Yeah, if you got a bunch of dudes in a room and says let's fuck up the WNBA
*  We couldn't came up a master plan
*  What these women have done?
*  This girl is incredible
*  What she did in college for women's basketball
*  What she's doing in a WNBA she's turned the fever were one and eight there. They have a winning record now
*  but the number of
*  Attention eyeballs, she's bought the cars in the pros and for these women to have this petty jealousness
*  You say to yourself
*  Damn
*  What is going on?
*  What is going on here?
*  And well you got accused of that stuff too with the older players being resentful of the new generation
*  It's kind of part of the basketball process. I mean it's their generations the best no no
*  Anytime we say something about guys and they to always get off my long guy
*  Yeah, but the stuff toward her is petty and jealous
*  And the thing I love about her she never says a word
*  And now when I watch her two things I like she's playing much faster
*  Yeah, much faster. She was playing too slow the first half of the season. She
*  Tired I think she was banged up
*  They didn't even give her the
*  understanding like
*  You girls been worried it for the WNBA season
*  Y'all been working out on the no sir. She came straight out of college
*  You had to go right to the WNBA like two weeks later
*  So they didn't practice there, but I think I thought when I watched her play the last
*  Month, I think she's learning to play much faster because I think she's learning to trust those girls more because you know
*  She's in college. She's not passing to a bunch of great players now. You can see what she plays
*  He's playing a lot without the boss. He's minding me a lot of Jason kid
*  Jason kids the best I've ever seen were playing without the basketball
*  Yeah, I played with Jason kid one time in an all-star game
*  He says so, you know, you should be getting like six to eight points a game more, right?
*  I was what you talking about? He says I'm gonna pick it ahead to you. Yeah, he says your point guards
*  Wait and give you the ball too late. If I give you the ball
*  Full speed ahead instead of waiting through the finish you get another eight to ten points a game
*  She's starting to see now if I play faster and give it to them sooner. So that tells he's really smart
*  But these ladies who I love and respect their game
*  They couldn't have fucked this thing up in a worst
*  What because we have talked and talk about Asia Asia was the best woman player in the world right now
*  She's incredible Connecticut sons having a great year to Memphis
*  Minnesota Lynx is having a great year
*  But that's been so much negativity and a lot of it is
*  Just petty jealousness and I love the way she just and I'll tell you what really good having her not making the Olympic team
*  Totally great. Well, it also gave her a break. Yes. That's what I was getting ready to say. Yeah, given her that time off
*  Has given her a chance to recharge her batteries
*  so it ended up
*  She probably did deserve to make the Olympic team on merit, but her getting that time off
*  Probably was the best thing happened to her
*  well
*  The other thing that happened her teammates you can see like a little osmosis
*  You watch that team now and they're pretty unselfish to watch like they're making extra passes
*  And it's the kind of stuff that happens when you're playing with a great player
*  well, but some of that is which I've enjoyed but some of that's her fault bill because
*  she
*  Like I say she I think she had one other girl on our team who made it to the WNBA
*  But she's learning now. I
*  Can play without the ball back to remember when I'm text winner?
*  It says Michael Oh the triangle you have to trust these other guys because first of all, it's gonna make it easier on you playing
*  Without the ball. It's much easier like for me. I can use myself an example not that I about me
*  when I got traded to Phoenix and
*  They gave me Dan Marley
*  Kevin Johnson said so follow and those guys
*  Man again, it goes back to the stuff. I told you about the Olympics, man
*  So easy for me to play basketball
*  Because I didn't have to make every pass. I didn't have to score every basket
*  Yeah, and I think Caitlin is learning that now like oh I can trust her I can trust her I can trust her I can trust her
*  I tell people that's why I said earlier about the Olympics man
*  When the game is so easy when you play with better players the game was on the heart when you play with guys who suck
*  You know, you know like because everybody is looking at you
*  You're like Chuck got the ball
*  Every defender is looking at you. Yeah playing with Marley
*  KJ says the ballos when I won MVP that was the easiest basketball I ever had to play
*  The other thing they have to figure out is anecdotally
*  I can't believe how many people in my life have been watching WNBA and have hardcore opinions on it
*  I'm getting an angel Reese versus Caitlin Clark rookie the year arguments and first team on BA
*  They got to figure out the schedule for the playoffs because I just think going against football is is
*  Just a no-win situation
*  I would love to see them try to figure out the little nooks so that they can actually get attention
*  The number one thing they got to do is find a way to let people know what the damn games are
*  Right. Well, that's another issue. It's on four places
*  They don't even matter about magic. It don't even matter about the playoffs
*  Yeah, if you have to go to I saw some I was watching some game that like it's called Ion Ion
*  Yeah, it's been huge for Ion. Yeah. No, it's been good for them
*  Damn, I mean like no you can't ask basketball fans to try to find on I mean
*  They were about to make you a big offer now. They're gonna pull it
*  You
