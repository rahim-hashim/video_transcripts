# The Warriors Are Facing Some Serious Problems | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A30JVQptP0A)
*  I was not ready to do a panic podcast about the Warriors, but I watched that Suns game last night
*  and I was alarmed. And I think Steve Kerr was too, because he was about as candid in the post game
*  about just what he didn't like and where the team was at. He usually doesn't do that, especially 15
*  games in the season. This was different, but I felt that way watching it. There was no fight.
*  They seemed disconnected and it's the same stuff we've seen all year. They're O and A on the road.
*  Is it panic time, Rob Mahoney? We're kind of getting there. And I think you're right to zero in on
*  Steve Kerr's response because when he's calling that stuff out over what he knows as well as anyone
*  is a long season for a championship team, there's still plenty of time theoretically to round it in
*  shape, but the effort is not there defensively. The focus is not there defensively. I mean, frankly,
*  if Steph Curry scores 50 points in a game, you should win it. And the fact that not only did they
*  not win it, they didn't even win his minutes. That is a huge concern. Didn't like the look on his face
*  during the tail end of the game either. That was the rarely seen semi-traumatized Steph Curry just
*  had that kind of vacant look inside. Curry is having the second best year of his career.
*  Statistically, it's the best. I think it might be the best. You don't think this is the best?
*  Well, statistically it is, but they're not getting the wins. But I'm just saying like
*  in 16 when he was doing basically the same kind of stuff, they were actually winning and they had
*  the right team around him. 32.8 points a game, 53-47-93 splits, 30.4 PR, which is where he was in 16.
*  He was in that range. And then the big thing, 5.1 made threes. He's the only person who's had 400 plus
*  threes in the game. And it feels like if he gets the minutes and the games played this year, it'll
*  happen again. But it's sad this time because there's nothing around him. And it's like the
*  second best player is Wiggins. Third best player, I guess, is Poole, even though he hasn't, I think,
*  has been as effective as last year. And then it drops. And the drop is, I think, what they
*  weren't expecting this year. They knew there'd be a transition. I think they probably expected to get
*  one more pretty solid clay Draymond combo year. And then maybe that starts easing toward the rookies.
*  But those guys, I just think they've kind of cratered this season, Clay especially, because
*  if Clay's not going to shoot the lights out, I don't really know what he brings to the table as
*  a two-way guy anymore. So let's start with Clay. Yeah. Kerr was making excuses for him. And that's
*  his right. He's the coach, but he's basically like, Clay's trying to hit a home run with every shot,
*  all the stuff he's said after. But I see a guy who's not rebounding, who's not getting in the
*  rim at all anymore, who's not the same defensive player that he used to be. So basically now he's
*  just a three-point specialist. He's basically, you're turning him into Sam Houser overnight,
*  which I don't think is where anyone wants to be. What do you see with Clay that I'm not seeing?
*  Well, I mean, to build on that point first, I think as far as the three or nothing,
*  or threes or bust kind of mentality for him, he just has no game inside the arc. Just is passing
*  up any chance he could possibly have to have a layup. And it's especially stark because you see
*  Steph on the other side of this, who's been as good driving the ball as we've ever seen him be,
*  just finishing and creating in so many ways inside. And like, God, I just keep coming back to the
*  juxtaposition of those two guys, because right now, of all the players taking 15 shots a game,
*  Steph is the most efficient. Clay is the absolute least efficient out flanking, you know, the Dylan
*  Brooks's and the Kevin Porter juniors and all of the guys you would expect to be in that company.
*  That's where Clay is. And none of us want this to be the case. Clay is a beloved NBA figure. He's
*  a guy who all of us love to see deliver in big moments, but he doesn't have that offensive part
*  to his game. To your point about the defense, not only is he not great defensively, but he's being
*  targeted. That's a different place in his career. That's a different space to occupy when teams are
*  thinking of you that way and going at you that way. It's really hard to watch him like this.
*  And especially in these games where you see him hit his first couple of shots, and you have to
*  wonder, is this a good thing or a bad thing? Does this mean we're going to see him pressing
*  in the second half because he's feeling it, even though he hasn't hit half his shots in any single
*  game this season so far? He just has not had it. Is that true? That's true. Oh my God. Yeah,
*  because we thought when the Booker thing happened, the way he reacted to that and it felt, I was
*  saying how it reminded me a little of that Dr. J Bird fight when Bird was just so much clearly
*  better than Dr. J and was talking shit and it finally snapped. You mentioned a crazy thing with
*  him. He's taken 15.4 shots a game, but he's averaging 15.1 points a game. Yep. If you're
*  averaging that many field goals, it's almost impossible to have less points than that, but
*  that's where he is. It's really rough. I don't know what the solutions are. And I think he
*  feels the pressure, right? Like he, he worked so hard to come back, came back last year. He
*  averaged 20 a game last year coming back off this stuff. And then in the playoffs didn't look great,
*  but then in the last second half of the Boston series started to look like clay again. And the
*  defense came back in the Boston series. For sure. That's why I'm so surprised by this,
*  that the defense is now gone. And like you said, like when they're targeting him, that's a whole
*  other animal. It was like when Luca started targeting Ben Simmons in that one game, it's
*  like, Oh, this Ben Simmons thing is bad. Luca's now like, bring on Ben Simmons. I want to torch
*  him. So you have that piece. And then you have Draymond, you know, his fall as an offensive
*  asset, which has been a couple of years in the making now, but now he's, you know, he's eight
*  points a game. He doesn't shoot threes at all anymore. He's only averaging 1.1 threes. He's
*  basically giving up the threes, but he also doesn't get to the free throw line. So now you have two
*  guys who don't get to the free throw line. Neither of them really rebound either. And like one of the
*  things that's alarming, you could look at all the different offensive, different, we could go into
*  fancy stat mode, but how about let's just look at they've taken 300 free throws this year and the
*  other team has taken 413. It's at 14 games. Brutal. So they're taking 66% as much as the other team
*  at the free throw line. Every game that's bad rebounding wise, 41.4, which is like 27th giving
*  up 45.1. So over and over again, they're losing on the board. So now we're losing at the free throw
*  line. We're losing on the boards, but we're also not shooting threes that well than Curry. There's
*  not a lot left. That's why I feel like six to nine is not an accident. Oh, and eight's not an
*  accident. When you're on the road rebounding, get to the line. Like there's things that happen
*  that can swing that. But if you're not doing either of those things on the road, that gets even worse.
*  And the rebounding thing is new. You know, the Warriors teams, like pre Kevin Durant and even
*  some in the Kevin Durant era, those were not especially good rebounding teams. And yet they
*  found ways to win last year. The Warriors were really good defensive rebounding team and they've
*  just completely fallen off a cliff. And some of that is just like who they're plugging into the
*  rotation of various spots. Some of it is Draymond getting a little older, Clay getting a little
*  older. You're relying so much on a guy like Kavan Loonie at this stage. And you're relying on Andrew
*  Wiggins, like night to night rebounding effort to really make all that stuff work. But I think the
*  formula we're seeing is if you're a team that cuts and offensive rebounds, you're going to score 120
*  points on the Warriors. The question is, is Steph going to get 40 or 50? And are they going to get
*  just enough from everybody else to put them over the top? Cause what this feels like to me, I don't
*  know that we've seen any point in, I mean, you'll have to forgive me for calling this the dynasty,
*  but of the Warriors dynasty era, the semi-dynasty, the Warriors semi-dynasty era, they've just never
*  had this little room for error before. And to your point last year, they, from a rebounding
*  standpoint, they were 45.5, their opponents were 42.6. So not only is that flip that's even flipped
*  a little worse from their end. And I don't honestly don't know how you solve it with the
*  guys they have because I think Wiseman they were counting on. And he, in theory could be that,
*  but he doesn't really show a lot of interest on the glass. A lot of the times he doesn't really
*  have the strength or the body type or even just like the box out technique for it.
*  I don't know what to do with my Wiseman stock. I talked to my NBA accountant the other day about
*  what to do. And it's just so low now. It's not even worth selling, but it's got to be a hold,
*  right? It's, it's, is it? I, I mean, I guess the move, the reason to keep it is the trade and we
*  can get to some of the trade possibilities in a second. But the, I just think of that 2020 draft
*  and I haven't seen, maybe somebody's written this piece. I haven't seen it, but such a weird draft,
*  right? With the pandemic, we have a college basketball season where there's no March badness
*  and then we have this goofy draft where if you go back and you look at it, the only guy you would
*  say in the top 12, that has a chance to make it on NBA teams is probably Anthony Edwards and
*  Hal Burton I think goes 13th or 14th, but you go on the line and you'd be like, Oh my God,
*  Wiseman man, they missed that pick. It's like, okay, who were they taken? Who should they have
*  taken instead? Should they have taken Isaac Okoro? Pat Williams? Yeah. Pat Williams should be like,
*  could you take it a Congress second over? Why is that? Nobody's doing that. Should they
*  have traded back? I would, I remember making the case during the summer. I thought they could have
*  traded back, potentially picked up another asset. I, I know that they liked Hal Burton. I think all
*  the smart teams liked Hal Burton. They weren't going to take them at two. Could have maybe traded
*  back and taken them, but you know, you just had a weird draft. That was the only bad draft out of the
*  last like six drafts, basically, right? Number two pick in any other draft. That's an incredible pick.
*  A year later, that's Evan Mobley, you know? And they just, it was just bad luck. They've had a
*  lot of good luck, but I think that was bad luck. I don't know what happens with Wiseman, but it's
*  hard to imagine him staying on this team would be my guess. It's going to be, he has a long road
*  ahead in order to just like get to NBA level competence, but games like this show that it's
*  not just him either. Like they were relying on him to be a big time player, but they sent him down
*  to the G league. They went up against a Suns team that is not very deep. Missing Chris Paul, missing
*  Cam Johnson, missing Jay Crowder, if you want to include him in that conversation. And yet even
*  their second unit was doing more than enough. And a lot of that is just because like the warrior's
*  defense is that accommodating where Steph is scoring 50 and yet like campaign is playing like
*  Steph against you. And that's kind of the trade-offs the warriors are playing with right now.
*  I'm glad you mentioned that. The fact that campaign lit it up on national TV,
*  torched them. That's got, that had to have driven Kurt the craziest out of anything. So
*  Weisman they're hoping, expecting they can get 20 minutes a game out of now he's in the G league.
*  They signed you Michael Green to be the Porter replacement. I have never been a
*  Jamaica Green fan. I've never gotten it. I've never understood it. And I feel like he's one
*  of those guys that looks good on paper and the stats guys like them. But when you actually watch
*  him, I just don't get it. I don't like he, to me, he's like a slow stretch for, he's like a,
*  the kind of a super duper discount version of better stretch for as I'd have. He's already
*  been benched. The Fincenzo who I always kind of wanted to see on a team like this, but the catch
*  was, well, can he stay in the court? He's already missed a bunch of games. They lost Porter for in
*  the green spot. And then the big thing for me is losing Peyton, which we knew was going to be a,
*  a factor. Peyton's been hurt. He's coming back on Portland soon, but you know, last year, at least
*  they had lineups where you're like, Oh, they're playing this line up. Like they had their defensive
*  identity lineup with Peyton. And those guys just really played well together. And I don't even know
*  like, what is their best five man lineup? Now would you say it's Currypool, Wiggins, green,
*  Looney? That's probably the best five they can put out. And that's in the league this year. That's
*  not going to be good enough with what's happened with, with, with Draymond. Then you'd be like,
*  well, put Clay in the Looney spot. Okay. Well now I'm not getting any rebounds at all.
*  So I don't really know what the answer is. And I don't think they do either.
*  I don't think they do. And really, I think a lot of it, a lot of the pressure points when we're
*  talking about this stuff are kind of circling around Clay and they're circling around Jordan
*  Pool, who has just been incredibly up and down. And I think, and mostly down just has not had it.
*  And, and you, I think you brought up a great point about Clay in terms of him feeling the pressure
*  and how that affects his play in a way, these are like the two worst kinds of players to feel
*  pressure in terms of Clay, a guy who is so reliant on three point shooting, and now you're
*  making him live and die with every miss. That's an incredibly tough and isolating place to be as
*  a player. And on the other side, being a young dynamic ball handler, who's trying to figure out
*  like, when do I pass? When do I create? When do I pull up? And you're feeling the pressure of being
*  up and down every game. It's just a bad recipe for pool too, that's going to lead to some like
*  really poor performances just in terms of like walking that line. Yeah. And you know,
*  it's a talk radio point to be like, well, Draymond punched him in the face. So that's a weird way to
*  start the year, but guess what? That was a weird way to start the year. Draymond, Draymond and
*  Curry. We're punching your coworkers in the face. Yeah. Draymond, Curry and Looney are the leaders
*  of the team. Draymond is the on-court energy, kind of emotional fulcrum of the team for better and
*  worse, right? And you can see like game two in the finals, when he knew they needed a different kind
*  of energy, he stepped it up. He got into a Jaylen, he's yelling at the refs. He just went full
*  Draymond. Haven't seen that guy this year. And it's been like, I don't know what the right verb is,
*  maybe like defanged, which is a weird use word for a basketball player. But I just don't see like that
*  that crazy in a good way Draymond on the court. And even yesterday, with like four minutes left,
*  he started trying to bark with Aitin and it was like, eh, you don't want to be in the position
*  where you're the ex champs near the end and you're trying to talk shit, but you can't back it up
*  anymore. And I think that's part of the problem. He can't back it up anymore. So I don't know where
*  that leaves him either because he can't be like aggro chest out guy when the team feels a little
*  fractured. So I don't know how that plays out either. What do you think with Draymond?
*  Well, it's hard to earn back your teammates trust and call them out for playing shitty defense at
*  the same time. Like that's, it's just an impossible place to be as a leader on that side of the ball.
*  And I think if there's one kind of macro silver lining here, I think it is that Draymond fact
*  you talked about that we have seen just so many times in the playoffs that he can step up his
*  energy, his focus, his intensity in exactly the way that they need defensively. And you would hope
*  that if they can just get through these next couple of months and kind of get things aligned
*  and kind of figure out what their bench situation is, that he'll be able to be that for them in the
*  end. Cause I think he's been okay. I don't think he's been a total disaster by any stretch this
*  season offensively has been tough at times defensively. I think he's mostly been pretty
*  good, but he needs to be great. Like that's just what they need from him on a nightly basis. And
*  so then you, if you get into this conversation of like, Oh, well, will Draymond be able to be
*  the best version of himself when it matters? I mean, your team is like 12th or 13th in the West
*  right now. It kind of matters right now. Like they may need playoff Draymond, you know, 20 games into
*  the season. That just might be the reality of what this Warriors team needs. And look, I know
*  nothing. As Scott van Pelt would say, I'm just a guy sitting on my couch.
*  I think if he fell on the sword a little bit publicly, I think that might help this whole thing.
*  Like I think when you're really the leader or one of the leaders,
*  like for, if he came out today and was like, you know what, we've sucked this season and partly
*  it's my fault. I really fucked up before the start of the season. I think it started us off weird and
*  we've got to get back to who we were. And part of that's my fault. And I'm one of the leaders of
*  this team and I got to fix it. He kind of went the other way. Like at opening night, when he's
*  wearing that green suit, he's got the documentary on Turner before the game that there was a lack
*  of kind of understanding about what kind of moment that was just from a public perception.
*  Right. So then now you're open the door for people like us to talk about it, but also like you are
*  one of the leaders, like being one of the leaders means you're looking out for everybody. You're
*  inspiring people, but you're not, you're not undermining them like that. And I really think
*  that that hurt them this season. And I don't think that's like a crazy take. I think when you start,
*  when you're a team that's built on chemistry and the emotional connection and the joy that that
*  team had last year, the thing I've seen, especially in these road games, the joy is gone. I don't see
*  it. They don't have like that swagger. And I don't know when that comes back. You watch like even a
*  team like the Celtics who they beat in the finals, Celtics have a little like swagger to them,
*  right? They know they're good. They're on the road. They're like taking a lead from 15 to 26
*  in Atlanta. And they want to like, you know, they have a little killer in strength and I just don't
*  see it with Golden State. And that's where games like this set off the alarms. Cause you would think
*  if they're going to show up for anything, if they're going to be the old warriors for anything,
*  national TV game against one of the best teams in the conference against a team that had their
*  number earlier this season where there was a little bit of spice in that matchup and there's
*  just nothing here. You know, they're given up 18 points in two minutes. Yeah. Like that's just
*  like an unacceptable level of execution from a defending champion. It's the reason why this
*  conversation starts slowly shifting from like, can they get it together to what options do they
*  really have to eventually we have to start talking about, like, are they, are they just squandering
*  an amazing individual season from Steph? Well, that's why we're doing this. It's just a completely wasted
*  opportunity at a certain point, but they have time to figure that out, but we have to start
*  kind of tilting that way a little bit. They have a top five guy. They've won four titles.
*  You have to fix this and save this. And the lead, the West is open. I think
*  extremely a West team that like completely scares you. There's some good ones,
*  some good, I don't think anybody's grabbed this season by the balls yet. Not at all.
*  Like I wrote down teams I liked. Denver, Memphis, Phoenix, all three of those teams. I have
*  questions about sure. Right. Phoenix. I don't know. I don't know what I'm getting from Chris Paul over
*  an eight month span. I don't know what they're trading Jay Crowder for. They were allegedly
*  trading him. The trade hasn't happened yet. Um, Memphis, I don't know if those guys get Baines
*  already hurt. I don't know when Jackson comes back. I just want, can I see those guys play together
*  for six weeks before I decide that they have the West by the balls and then Denver,
*  do you feel awesome about Porter right now? Like, do you feel like he's going to be there
*  six months from now? Cause I like them, but I don't know. I just, and I think he's too
*  important to what they do. I, I just don't know. I don't trust it. He's had some really incredible
*  games, but he needs, he needs a larger body of work to build that kind of confidence. And frankly,
*  so does Jamal Murray who post injury, definitely you can see him and feel him being a little
*  tentative overthinking some of his opportunities. And we need the Jamal Murray that is reactive,
*  that is looking to attack guys. Like that's the most interesting version of that player to watch
*  and project. And certainly the most valuable one to the nuggets. So hopefully he can get there by
*  the end of the season. But you're right. Like there's just no teams in this Western conference
*  landscape that are, that are grabbing this right now. And even some of the ones we thought would
*  be pretty good, like Dallas is blowing some games that they really should be winning.
*  Minnesota is just not anywhere here where they need to be to be a contending team. The Clippers,
*  obviously they're going to get, you know, supposedly getting quiet Leonard back soon. So
*  we'll see how that goes, but there, there was a real opportunity here for somebody, anybody to
*  seize control of this thing. If, if only for playoff seating, much less for whatever's going
*  to happen in the playoffs. Well, the other thing in the West, and this speaks to how unusually
*  deep the league is like, he just watched tonight and like the Kings can beat the Warriors, right?
*  You watch it. It's like, it doesn't feel like an upset, like talent wise, they can play with those
*  guys. And sometimes it'll just come down to the variance of who hit more threes or did somebody
*  get into foul trouble. But for the most part, like even a team like OKC, who we thought was
*  going to be the bottom, but they have an awesome player. They play well together. They can hang
*  around in these games. They can steal games. So they can guard people. Yeah. There's no night off
*  really across the board, except for only a couple of teams, I think. So you look at the West and
*  it's just night after night. It's somebody decent. We didn't expect the Blazers are going to be good.
*  Well, the Blazers have been good. You know, Minnesota is the number one team in the conference
*  right now. Portland Trail Blazers. Minnesota hasn't been good, but guess what? They still have good
*  players in their team and night to night, you just never know. So I think that's another thing with
*  the Warriors. So the West is there to be grabbed, but the longer they don't do anything,
*  six and nine could pretty easily turn into like 15 and 23. And now you're in the danger zone. Now
*  you're in the play in, you know, and then that gets even hairier. The question with Weisman and
*  Kamega is those guys had, I think, a real amount of value last summer. And I don't know what that
*  value is now because neither of them have played well. And you have the league knowing now if the
*  Warriors have to make a move, those two guys are going to be in it. So like people are, you know,
*  Durant is starting to get buzz again as a possible trade target for them. Durant gave a couple
*  interviews that as usual, one of the reasons you got to love Durant, like he's pretty candid.
*  Like he doesn't pull punches. That thing about, hey man, I'm in this lineup with Sumner and he
*  lists all the guys. He's like, how are we supposed to be good? It's like, Jesus, nobody says shit
*  like that. Royce O'Neal and Nick Claxton didn't deserve that. Come on. That was a drive by.
*  But now people think Durant might be available. To me, Townes has to be at least on a little bit
*  of a watch at that Minnesota thing. I know it's he's hard at her trade cause he just got an
*  extension. Davis on the Lakers, you never know. But there's little French stuff they can do,
*  right? Like they could do something with Indiana. There's Miles Turner potential.
*  Miles Turner kind of seems like he's available. There's Pertle and San Antonio who's around.
*  I don't know. I feel like there's moves to be made, but how far do you think they would go?
*  Do you think they would go full scale? We have Curry, a generational superstar. We have to,
*  we have a window right now. Here's some picks. Here's Wiseman, here's Kamenka. Moody's on the
*  table. Like we're getting another awesome guy. Or do you think they'll try to patch it together?
*  I'm inherently a little skeptical that they'll just throw all the young guys in. I mean, for one,
*  I think Poole is pretty well set with the Warriors. I don't really include him in that
*  conversation. It's more of a Moody, Wiseman, Kamenka conversation as far as like how many
*  of those guys, if any, could be moved. And their picks. And like picks, pick swaps,
*  they have all that stuff available, I think, that they could get frisky with.
*  And the Warriors have been very insistent on playing the long game. They've been very
*  insistent on playing the long game in terms of like their public comments, that they are playing
*  the long game with those guys, that they still believe in them, that they still believe in their
*  long-term prospects. They were also very publicly insistent that like, oh, D'Angelo Russell is a
*  long-term fit here. And we signed him to keep him and he's going to be a part of our core. And then
*  he's gone. You know, like these things happen. Things can turn very quickly. And so while I think
*  the default would, the hope would certainly be to let a veteran crew sort itself out. I mean,
*  I would not be surprised to see at least one of those three young players gone by the deadline.
*  It just seems like we're heading in that direction one way or another. The only question is like,
*  who did the Warriors target and kind of what do those packages look like? Because
*  we've seen a lot of evidence at this point to suggest that like just being a good veteran
*  isn't enough to plug and play in this system. Like Kelly Oubre is a good player for lots of teams.
*  He was not a good player for the Warriors. And that's something I worry about with a guy like
*  Miles Turner, who can be really valuable in a lot of contexts, but like quick hitting,
*  read and react type stuff is not really where his strong suits are either.
*  Right. It's one of that Landale people like that. Guys who know how to play the game.
*  They Anthony Lambs apparently, you know?
*  Yeah. I'm trying to think what I would do if I were them. Like it's the same thing I would
*  have done this summer. If I had a chance to get the rant, that would have been my first thing to
*  figure out. The second thing I would figure out is what do we do with this Draymond thing?
*  Because I think he's going to opt in next year because I just don't think
*  he's like 26, 27 million next year. And I just don't think he's going to get that in the open
*  market. Clay, I feel like they can't trade. As weird as that sounds, I just think he's,
*  he means too much to everything. And that's a really, really,
*  there's only a couple of GMs. I think that would be that cutthroat. Like Danny Angel would have
*  traded them in five seconds. There's so there are a couple of people that do it. I just don't know
*  if the warriors are wired that way, but I do think they would trade Draymond. And maybe that's part
*  of the answer here. I kept, I was trying, I was in a trade machine trying to make trades
*  and trying to figure out like, could the Lakers get Draymond and Ki-Ree?
*  Could Russell Westbrook end up in Brooklyn? Could, could the rant end up, you know, like you start
*  doing these three team, 14 things and it's like, I can't figure out why Brooklyn would trade the
*  rant unless they were just getting, you know, better than what Minnesota got for Gobert or if
*  they're getting Brandon Ingram, something like that. So I just doubt they would trade them,
*  but maybe there is some version with Indiana and Miles Turner and some other piece. And
*  maybe you get Brooklyn in and they just take Westbrook back to get rid of Kyrie. And maybe
*  they get some sort of little sweetener. I'm sure they're in the office thinking about all this
*  stuff, right? Like, what do we do? How do we get out of this? And I would say that I would say it's
*  Wiseman, it's Kuminga and probably Draymond would be the three pieces. I don't think they would trade
*  Moody. I mean, Kuminga is the guy who, if you're just thinking from the perspective of other teams,
*  you could see a lot of potential value in where his career could go. Just even in a slightly
*  different context where you're asking something a little different of him, where you're putting
*  him in different positions. And certainly Jonathan Kuminga is a guy who plays with the confidence
*  and has the opinion of himself where he thinks he can fill those other kinds of prospecting star
*  roles to step into something bigger. We'll see if he ever gets that opportunity here or elsewhere.
*  But I kind of lean the fact, like I do think if they make a trade, it's going to be more on the
*  role player end of the spectrum than the like Draymond is also in this package and we're gunning
*  for stars. I just don't see all the pieces kind of aligning in a way that the Warriors would need
*  for something like that. Not too much of a damper on you and your studio, you know, really putting
*  the masterpiece on canvas with this thing. Listen, I wasn't using like the paint. I was
*  using my mess around paint. I was using like one of my cheaper canvases. Now the Draymond thing,
*  part of the problem is he's like they need him and he's not playing more for them. So if I'm
*  another team, I'm like, well, why would I trade for him then if you guys don't want him? Really,
*  the Lakers would be the only one. And I mean, there's Davis possibilities if that Laker season
*  goes completely sideways, right? Towns has to be watched. Other than that, I mean, everybody's
*  pretty happy with their teams. It's not like there's all of these solutions falling out of the sky,
*  right? And that's another issue with this. So you're probably right. Maybe it's patchwork stuff.
*  It's probably people at that Miles Turner level, but ultimately they might've, I think the window
*  might've come a year earlier than maybe everybody thought. I really thought this was going to be the
*  transition year for them. I thought they were going to be good. The pool thing made me nervous
*  and now I don't know, but I, all I know is they're wasting one of the great, not only
*  Curry seasons, but one of the great guard seasons. Like this is like one of the, like through 14 games,
*  this is one of the greatest guard seasons we've, non-MJ seasons we've had. And they're kind of
*  pissing it away. He's been absolutely unbelievable. And like that, that really is the tragic piece of
*  it so far. But what will really make this a shame if they can't salvage it in some way.
