# Are the Clippers the Most Talented Team in the League? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APFCdIBC9sU)
*  The Clippers didn't have anybody that could make a pass.
*  You know, there are an ISO team.
*  And the biggest thing with Arden when you watch is
*  he's setting those two guys up.
*  But more importantly, they have a pick and roll game again because Zoop now
*  has become unbelievable.
*  And that's due to James Arden.
*  So that's why I'm going to have to admit defeat on this Clippers.
*  I thought the heart of trade was just a horrendous idea by them.
*  And I didn't understand why they gave so much.
*  I thought it was one of the dumbest things they've ever done in the franchise.
*  And yet they're 20 and six in their last 26.
*  The the numbers, Kawaii's last 15 games for last night.
*  He was shooting 60 percent, 53 percent from three.
*  Hardin's last 20, he shoot 46 percent from three.
*  Paul George's last 16, 45 percent from three.
*  Zubot's 14 and 11 shooting almost 70 percent.
*  Like this is a long, sustained offensive excellence
*  that when you watch it feels legitimate.
*  Bill, who is deeper?
*  Who has more talent?
*  Just forget the fit.
*  Who has more talent in the Clippers?
*  Right. If you're just saying don't think about durability,
*  don't think about chemistry, maybe just the Celtics and that's it.
*  I don't think the Celtics.
*  I don't think anyone has more talent.
*  Yeah. If you're adding like Norm Powell and people like that. Yeah.
*  If you go eight to nine deep,
*  there is not a team more talented in the NBA.
*  I don't even think it's close than the Clippers. All right. They're.
*  Now they kind of fit now better to
*  Russ coming off the bench, Norman Powell, Russ brings them energy,
*  Zub and James together.
*  James is playing terrific basketball,
*  but he fits them more.
*  He gets to have the ball in his hands and that's what he wants.
*  He has a big that rose.
*  His biggest complaint, Billy, is Joe didn't roll.
*  But we wanted to give Joe the ball.
*  Right. We didn't need him to roll.
*  And Joe is proving that that was right, too.
*  So this is a fit for him and for the team.
*  The biggest question is defensively, could you hold out?
*  And the second question and the biggest thing is,
*  Ty would tell you this, they're healthy.
*  They're all playing, you know.
*  We said, what are the odds of that?
*  Like, I must say, five to one.
*  Yeah, Kauai's missed a few of late, but he plays every night.
*  Paul George hasn't missed.
*  James never missed.
*  That's the one thing.
*  And I've always been consistent with that with James.
*  He's a baller. He's not going to miss a lot of games.
*  He wants to play every night.
*  He is like what he is like, basically, Carl Malone in more ways than one.
*  Like one of the most durable players of all time
*  and probably similar playoff success.
*  But you're right.
*  But there's just there's the two versions of James right now.
*  We're getting the happy facilitator, which is your favorite version of James.
*  We haven't seen the oh, wait, I didn't make the All-Star game.
*  Even though I'm I'm facilitating all of this.
*  Yeah, and he's and he should have clearly.
*  But I'm saying even this year, what if he doesn't make it this year?
*  What I think this year, at least he has the ball in his hands
*  where with us, he didn't have the ball.
*  He had the ball a lot, but he had to give it to Joe.
*  He still had the ball at times.
*  But a lot of times, you know, given the Joe, the ball on the elbow
*  and being a cutter mover, just that's not how he wanted to play.
*  Yeah. You know, I always say everyone says they want to win
*  until you tell me to do something different. Right.
*  But this role for him, whether he makes it or not,
*  he still is the facilitator and he has the ball.
*  He gets to make the plays.
*  And that's what he is.
*  And that's what he wants to do.
*  So I think I don't see unhappy James coming.
*  That doesn't mean he'll be, you know, efficient in the playoffs.
*  That's where he has to improve.
*  The one thing I will say that will help him.
*  And my biggest knock against James, it's hard to win
*  when you have one player that just dominates the ball. Right. Yeah.
*  Well, on the Clippers, they don't have that.
*  Yeah, it's moving. Yeah. Right.
*  And so that kind of protects that narrative, where if you take James out,
*  he still can be effective on the Clippers, you know.
*  And so I think, listen, you my four teams, if you got to go to in the West.
*  And they moved in your top two.
*  They them, them and Denver in the West for me.
*  I know we love Minnesota.
*  And that's Minnesota's some some signs lately.
*  Listen, they had a fight in the playoffs last year. Yeah.
*  And the fight was not against the opposing team. Right.
*  You know, so until they can show that they can perform
*  under the pressure of the playoffs, I'm just I love them.
*  But I'm just not buying them yet.
*  Little bit different of a bullseye with them, too,
*  where now people know they're good.
*  So night after night, you got to bring it.
*  But they're I watched them a lot because I like watching them.
*  They're asking a lot from Connelly at this point in his career.
*  There's just nights when he doesn't have it.
*  Edwards is still trying to figure out what he is as a top 20 guy.
*  And there's nights when sometimes he seems to want certain things
*  from the game that maybe the game does need.
*  So they're a work in progress. I'm not counting them out.
*  I would go Denver, OK, see, and I probably have the Clippers third.
*  But, you know, under the caveat of all those guys have to stay healthy.
*  Yeah, I just think in the playoffs, the Clippers are deeper than everybody.
*  And they coach the great coach and they're deep with veterans.
*  Then they don't have everyone on their team is a bet.
*  And man, that's that's going to be a tough out for someone.
*  I just I look at them. They're so deep.
*  I don't know how everyone's not going to play that.
*  Yeah, you know, if and that's where James
*  helps to on the night that Paul George goes AWOL.
*  You're right. You just got to go two for three.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And that's one of the reasons they did the trade is because on the nights
*  of regular season games when Kawhi doesn't play, you still have Paul and James.
*  You know, you bring in Norman Powell.
*  Yeah, and they're just you bring in Russ.
*  They are deep and they're going to be a handful in the playoffs.
*  Well, they're committed to this season.
*  They're spending an incredible amount of money and they've spent all their picks
*  for the chance they have this year.
*  And to me, they don't care about.
*  Well, I know they don't care about that.
*  Yeah, but the picks and the future.
*  They have no future.
*  They have no future. They have to win.
*  They have to win in the next this year and next year.
*  Other than that, they're in trouble.
*  Well, there's one other piece that's a little scary.
*  It's the hardened extension because now it's going great.
*  It's going awesome.
*  But now you're buying it for three more years.
*  And where am I? You're fine.
*  It's a good thing with that.
*  The answer he will give you the edge.
*  So to me, that's an easy one.
*  Because when the playoffs start
*  and if he plays great and they go deep, then there's your answer.
*  If he doesn't, then there's your answer.
*  You know, so that's an easy one.
*  But if I told you Kawhi was going to be awesome
*  and look like 2019 Kawhi again.
*  If that hardened trade, I don't know if the hardened trade
*  was the catalyst to it or whether Kawhi is just finally healthy again.
*  I still think they might have been really good, even if they didn't make the trade,
*  just because of how good Kawhi is.
*  Like just is one of the there's seven top guys in the league
*  and then Kawhi is the eighth, depending on how healthy he is.
*  Like if you're just going to rank the players right now,
*  the way he's playing right now is like he's on the level of all the other best guys.
*  Kawhi is as good as anybody in the league right now.
*  Yeah. But we wouldn't have said that a year ago or we would have said that
*  two months ago. He wasn't healthy.
*  And he's and he's healthy now.
*  So he's back to what he was basically.
*  But I disagree in the fact they wouldn't be this good without James, because
*  no, I agree with that.
*  They needed a point guard in a desperate way.
*  And that's, you know, when I was talking to them,
*  meaning the Clippers about the trade, that's all they kept talking about.
*  Yeah, we just we need a facilitator.
*  We need someone who can pass.
*  And he's done it. I mean, I said, well, the one thing the guy has
*  is vision and his ability to set you up is as good as anybody in the league.
*  And I said, if he stays with that.
*  You guys are going to be hard to beat.
*  If he doesn't, you guys are going to be hard to beat, you know,
*  at the bottom line.
*  So, yeah, I think he does help both guys.
*  This is shaken my prognosticating confidence,
*  because I was just like, this is a disaster.
*  And I don't know what version they're getting of James.
*  And you watch them and I went to a couple of games and I mean,
*  I look pretty good, like, you know, those three guys, like they don't they
*  they share the ball really nicely.
*  And they there's you're watching their offense and sometimes James
*  will get rid of it and I'll circle around and go in the right corner.
*  And then all of a sudden, he's getting a wide open three.
*  And I mean, that looked good.
*  And then Zhu has like the little alley from somebody cuts in.
*  All of a sudden, he's at the rim with his arms up, which he's really good at.
*  I look good, too.
*  And you just see it enough.
*  It's like, hey, this seems good.
*  Give Tyson credit, too, because, you know,
*  I thought it was going to work early.
*  And I was on record of saying that I just like the fact that James is a point guard.
*  But I had to make some tough decisions and some right ones,
*  you know, putting Russ on the bench, not playing Tucker.
*  I think those are all the right decisions, you know.
*  And that's the one of the things I've always liked about Ty.
*  Like he he will make it and he will just take the heat.
*  You know, you know, there's been grumblings that like BJ Tucker's not happy.
*  OK, well, that's right.
*  But you're still not going to play. Right.
*  You know, the checks come in every two weeks.
*  Yeah. And he doesn't fit the team and the way they need to play.
*  And so I think those decisions are so hard to make and ties down there.
