# Steph Curry Did Everything in Game 7 Against the Rockets | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A)
*  Rusello, what are you going to remember about this game 10 years from now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=0.0s)]
*  10 years from now, probably not much, but it is not exactly on par with my favorite Steph game of all [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=3.2s)]
*  time in 2019 scoreless in the first half and then 23 in the third quarter. So it goes for over 30 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=9.6s)]
*  in the second. It's probably my favorite Steph game. But yeah, he wasn't, he wasn't getting it done. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  He was making other plays. Certainly his movement alone opens up other things for other people. But [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  when a men Thompson couldn't contest on that three point to the right side, like the first thought is [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=25.28s)]
*  he actually got an open look against the men. It actually happened. And then we realized it was a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=30.32s)]
*  continuation of the calf injury they had on that layup attempt. And so think of you're a Houston fan, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=34.88s)]
*  you're probably not going to remember this in 10 years, but at least this week, you're wondering [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=40.32s)]
*  how the game goes if a man is able to just stay in there because it was, that was honestly, I think [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=43.44s)]
*  one of the most defensively challenged series that I've seen from Steph in his career. And granted, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  he's older now too, but it was just a grind to even get open looks. Can I make the case for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=53.04s)]
*  the Steph Curry performance? Can I zag? Is it zag time already? Well, you're not comparing it to 19, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=60.0s)]
*  right? No. All right. Thank you. You know what I liked about it? First of all, I think Emei from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=66.16s)]
*  the 2022 finals was just like, fuck this. I'm not letting this guy beat us. I'm going to, not only [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=74.0s)]
*  am I going to double him when he has the ball and send second guys at him, I'm going to double him [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=80.96s)]
*  when he doesn't have the ball. Have you ever seen a guy get guarded with multiple guys when he wasn't [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=86.16s)]
*  anywhere near the ball? Because that's what they were doing. They were grabbing them, they were [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  holding them. They were like double teaming them from back and forth and they were just like, you're [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  just, you're not going to beat us. So then it came down to Buddy healed and Pinzemski for three [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=100.56s)]
*  quarters. Buddy was great. Pods was, that was a rough Pods game. He played hard, but when you think, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=105.76s)]
*  what did he finish with? He was four for 12, one for seven from three. All of those were open. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=113.84s)]
*  But they basically were just like, we're not letting Steph. So Steph figures this out early [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=120.56s)]
*  and you can either try to go hero ball and just launch some crazy threes with a hand in your face [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  or just continue to try to keep making the right plays, swinging the ball, trusting your teammates. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=130.0s)]
*  It was a great trust your teammates performance. And then when, when they finally let up and he saw [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=135.76s)]
*  some daylight, he grabbed it and then Jimmy took care of the rest. But I, I really thought like he [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=141.36s)]
*  did everything you had to do in this game. That team, there was one stretch where they had Thompson [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=146.64s)]
*  and Easton out there with Jabari Smith. And there was like this three minutes stretch of defense where [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=151.84s)]
*  it was like, Oh my God. Like it seemed like a miracle just to get a shot off in 24 seconds, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=156.88s)]
*  but they unfortunately couldn't sustain it and they couldn't make a shot. I thought that was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  such an impressive win by Golden State though. They were down to five guys plus Looney that you [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  could trust five and a half, five and a third. Yeah. Kaminger got out there and he had some, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=172.32s)]
*  he had some interesting possessions. Um, you know, so if you look at that with Moody, he only played [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=179.2s)]
*  11 minutes in this game. Um, yeah, I mean, Draymond's 40 minutes and he hit a couple shots [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=185.52s)]
*  early, but you just know offensively, it's not necessarily something you can rely on. He had two [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=190.32s)]
*  shot clock threes in the second half. I think they're both in the fourth quarter. They're like, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=194.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Cause there's all these plays where the entire defense is designed to, we want it to end [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=197.76s)]
*  up in the wrong guy's hands. And if you're thinking of Houston and EMA's game plan and the players [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=203.68s)]
*  executing it, they actually executed it perfectly. You just don't expect buddy. He'll go for 23 in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=208.64s)]
*  the first half. So if you don't have that second guy, even Jimmy is going to go a little bit [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=213.12s)]
*  slower. Like there's even a few moments with Jimmy before that outburst where you're like Van Vliet, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  got him on a turnover and you're like, man, you've got Van Vliet Iso. Like you gotta, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=222.08s)]
*  you gotta go with this guy. Uh, they didn't score a point for four plus minutes until you had that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=226.08s)]
*  Jimmy layup, then the threes. And then you had the review on the layup after Beal forced the turnover [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=230.96s)]
*  when Van Vliet pushed Butler. And that pretty much was the game, but it's incredibly frustrating for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=236.8s)]
*  Houston team that probably feels like they did a lot of things, a lot of things right tonight, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=242.0s)]
*  but you know, they ended up with six made threes. Three of those were garbage times. So over the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=246.08s)]
*  course of the game being competitive, a team that averaged 11 threes per game, games one through [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=250.4s)]
*  six had three. So technically they had six in this one. But you know, when you and I were talking [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=254.64s)]
*  this morning, it's almost like buddy healed, even though less is expected of them took on the Van [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=258.96s)]
*  Vliet role that we've seen in the last few games, cause that was a huge difference. We can talk big [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=264.0s)]
*  lineups, rebounding edge, second chance points, points to paint. All these things are real things, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=268.24s)]
*  but Van Vliet was playing out of his mind for three straight games in the series. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=272.72s)]
*  Steph is now five and oh in playoff series against Houston. Now that counts the 2016 one where he [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=276.08s)]
*  got hurt and they won anyway, but, uh, they still have not beaten the team with Steph Curry. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=281.12s)]
*  That's what his gravity is like though. Even if he's not playing, he's just in the building. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  We don't want to have a gravity combo. Just even street clothes gravity. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=289.44s)]
*  Well, I think it's at least worth mentioning because when I think of like, we get to these [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=295.68s)]
*  points of the playoffs where if you don't like somebody and you have a platform, there's a really [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=300.56s)]
*  good chance that the guy you don't like gets eliminated and then you just get to say that the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=306.32s)]
*  guy sucks. It's almost this video game where there's just different tiers of like, all you're trying to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  navigate is a way to get to saying the guy you don't like sucks. And the chances, like the odds [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=314.88s)]
*  are in your favor that you'll get to say it about certain players. And my contention has always been [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=320.32s)]
*  like some players are really great and they're great in elimination games and they still lose. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=324.32s)]
*  And when Steph doesn't have any points up until the very end of the first half, I'm watching it [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=327.52s)]
*  going, well, this is going to turn into one of those moments where when everything that's happening [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=332.0s)]
*  offensively, you know, there's a few possessions where he just doesn't have it on cuts, but they're [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=338.08s)]
*  like the buddy healed left side first half three and Van Gundy called it out. They ran Steph through [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=342.32s)]
*  everybody shifted to the right side and then buddies fine. And then there's a Draymond [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=347.68s)]
*  drive on the left side where they run Steph through everything. Everybody. It's like a wave of people [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=352.32s)]
*  just going to his side. So by him just being active, cause I think there's a lot of stars in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=357.28s)]
*  those spots, especially a little bit older or just so frustrated. They're not going to cut, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=362.8s)]
*  you know, they're, they're probably going to put up a few more shots just to say, at least I took a few [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=367.04s)]
*  and he, he really wouldn't even take the bad shots if he felt like it wasn't a good look. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=371.52s)]
*  So you're coming around. I thought that was, you're on my side now. I feel like I won you over. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I thought that was a good Steph game. I was ready to zag the whole time, even in half time, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=381.76s)]
*  when he had three points, I was like, you know what, I'm going to figure out how to do this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=385.92s)]
*  I guess I don't feel like you should have to defend the guy anymore at 37 years old and I'm [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  not picking them in the next round. So this has been kind of nice. Oh, that you getting off. Oh, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  yeah. Yeah. I don't think they're going to want me to help you. We want me to help you with their bags. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=399.52s)]
*  As you get off the bandwagon, it's like 1923. You're just getting off the train. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=403.92s)]
*  When I asked you, did you pick or did you just give me the odds? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=411.76s)]
*  I'll, I'll give you a thought in a second. Can I, can we talk about Steve Kerr for a second? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=414.88s)]
*  Cause I thought he coached an awesome game today. What did you like? I rarely do this [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=421.12s)]
*  cause this is the old Hubie Brown thing about Hubie Brown loved every time out. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=427.12s)]
*  Um, I thought Kerr called like three or four of the best timeouts of the playoffs. He felt, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=431.68s)]
*  and I only, we've talked about this in the past. There's only a couple of coaches that really [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=438.56s)]
*  understand how to protect the lead where it's like, all right, we are up between eight and 15 points [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  for an hour here. I can't let them get a run. I can't let the crowd get into it. I feel something [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  bad happening time out right now. And he did it like every time I felt like, Oh man, I think the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=455.92s)]
*  wheels are about to come off. He was just like, I've had enough. He had that one play when they [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=460.4s)]
*  went zone in the fourth quarter and Van Gundy called it out. And he was like, he needs to get [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=464.08s)]
*  Jimmy Butler back in the game to break this zone. And there was like 10 seconds up in the shot clock [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=468.96s)]
*  and Kerr's like, time out. I don't like the possession we're about to have. Let me, let me [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=472.88s)]
*  preempt this, um, to know, not know what you're getting from any of your bench guys, right? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=478.23999999999995s)]
*  Think about the bench. It was other than Looney, just a complete no show from everybody. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=483.76s)]
*  He knows he has to play Butler and Curry big minutes. He obviously talked about that, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=490.8s)]
*  but I think they went 44 and 45 for minutes. And it's like, how can I takes Curry out with like [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  a minute before the end of the quarter, just to kind of buy him that little break. Um, I just [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=500.88s)]
*  thought he did a really good job. So he called one at nine 42 when he didn't like it immediately. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=505.52s)]
*  He wanted to get Butler back in the game. And I love that timeout because I do think, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=510.48s)]
*  especially in this game where it was low scoring, you know, there've been games in the past where [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=514.16s)]
*  you're watching a coach and he wants to make the substitution and then they don't have a stoppage. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=519.2s)]
*  He doesn't want to burn the timeout. And you're like, okay, well what's more valuable this time [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=522.48s)]
*  out, which again, I'd always want to have one in my back pocket, especially in an inbound in a close [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=525.84s)]
*  game. But there's also some math of, okay, we just went three possessions on offense without this guy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=529.52s)]
*  And in game six, where Detroit beat New York Brunson left the game and then he went to go [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=536.72s)]
*  to the scores table at about two minutes left. And five, you mean, uh, yeah, excuse me, game five, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-mbfmH-T_A&t=543.84s)]
