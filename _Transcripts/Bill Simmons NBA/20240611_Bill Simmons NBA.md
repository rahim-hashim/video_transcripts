# Could Miami Trade Jimmy Butler? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo2ceu0ZVU0)
*  Did you see the clip of Butler at the Sparks game talking about number 22?
*  And then, yeah, he did a tweet and there's just a lot of breadcrumbs being dropped really from
*  that Pat Riley press conference and some of the stuff Spolstra said.
*  And Miami's making it clear, we love this guy, but we're also really disappointed with how
*  this season went is, is the read I'm getting from them. We want our best guy.
*  If we're going to pay him this much money to play basketball more.
*  And we want to have more success and we appreciate 23. We appreciate 20,
*  but moving forward, we're, we're not doing this anymore.
*  And then you have Jimmy and the other side, you know, winking at the Lakers and it just.
*  We're still, we've been here a lot of times when the breadcrumbs start dropping, I take notice.
*  The first thing I thought of from the most recent footage is that's why he tells his assistant.
*  He's like, I stopped telling me I need to sign up for Raya. I don't, I don't need to. I'm good.
*  I just. I show up in a Jersey and it's on. The other thing where this all started was maybe it's
*  pre Pat Riley basically calling him out for talking shit about the Celtics. I mean, that was a really
*  rare thing that happened. That doesn't happen. He called him out. He called him out. Yeah. He,
*  he did something so many other GMs are so afraid of doing because there'll be times
*  you'll hear stories about, well, why did you do this? Why did you do that? And you're like,
*  we're always in fear. We're living in fear all of the time. Now 30 GMS may not agree with me with
*  that, but there's enough GMS that live in fear of doing all the little extra things, catering to the
*  star the entire time for just that fear that one day he's going to walk in and say, Hey, I actually
*  want out of here. And you have Riley on the other side, just going, Nope, like I'm not, I'm not even,
*  I'm going to go out of my way to publicly criticize you, even though you're the face of the franchise.
*  And Riley may have done it without any idea of a backup plan. Now, maybe it was Riley having this
*  many decades in this sport. Maybe he's on the short list of guys with enough juice that can pull it
*  off and do it. But then you'd, you'd have to also want to do it. And Riley clearly wanted to do that
*  the same way when LeBron left Miami. That's the big one. Two days before when he called him out.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And he got out there and he was just, he was letting him have it in a way.
*  This is hard. Yeah. Right. This is hard. You're not supposed to bail just cause you didn't win the
*  title one year. It's hard to win the title. This is great. It was one of my favorite Riley moments.
*  I would add to what you just said though, Riley's old and I think old people hit the point sometimes
*  in all aspects of life where they're just like, fuck it. It's like the old Jerry Seinfeld joke
*  about old people backing out of the driveway where they hit a point where they're just like,
*  fuck it. And they just go back. They don't care if cars are coming. They just go backwards.
*  The gym, same thing. Like there's a certain age, I believe they get together. Like you hit 70,
*  they all have a meeting. They pull you aside and they just say, Hey, balls everywhere. It's over.
*  We don't have to worry about it anymore. I'm convinced if you're still in the gym lifestyle
*  at 70 years old, I'm sure that somebody reaches out to you. Like, Oh, you have a birthday coming
*  up next week. Here's the protocol. So I think they say that about first base coaches too,
*  first base and third base coaches, balls out. Anyway, I interrupt them. Because we agree.
*  There's something that happens and certainly Riley is north of that age and also whatever
*  accomplishments you would need to feel comfortable doing that. And also the job security on top of
*  everything else, because the Butler thing is still unsettled. And if it were unsettled,
*  maybe they're like, Hey, he's older and there's ceilings. So I don't even care. But he may have
*  done this if he was just extended in 32 years old, who knows?
*  Well, and then the other piece of this ecosystem where teams aren't allowed to tamper,
*  but teams are, are allowed to put it out there off the record to reporters. Like,
*  like a Philly situation. We have a lot of calf space. We love Jimmy.
*  Just kind of put that. Who doesn't Philly love by the way? Philly loves everyone. They have,
*  go down the list on anyone who makes more than 20 million a year. They love them.
*  But he's somebody that I don't know if they have the assets, but the Lakers one is pretty fun
*  because you could crack, you could put salaries together with picks. I think they'd have to,
*  I think Miami would have to get a third piece. I don't think Miami feels like they're,
*  I just always feel like they're a team that needs the player coming back and they've really never
*  prioritized draft picks. So keep going. Right. So if they're doing, if it's like Rui Hatchamora
*  and Gabe Vincent and multiple picks, I don't think Miami is going to be like, oh, cool.
*  Now we're out of the Jimmy Butler business. Like they, they want stars and big ass players. So
*  if they're moving Butler, whatever version that he gets from whatever team would go somewhere else
*  to get somebody that they actually want. Like the McHale Bridges, Brandon Ingram, whoever they talk
*  themselves into. I think that would be why you do it. The bigger question for me is just,
*  does Miami feel like they just had this incredible run at the blackjack table with Butler, right?
*  Four years, they made two finals. He played great. He's probably a hall of famer now. It couldn't
*  have gone better. And now it's like 2 30 in the morning. And this is like when I'm at the casino
*  and they're starting to vacuum and Sal's like, let's go. And I'm like, no, no, one more hand.
*  And I think, I think Miami's like, they're vacuuming. It's we should, we should go,
*  let's go cash the chips in. And that's what I wonder with this Butler thing. Are they just like,
*  this is only going to get worse. He's older. He's got a ton of miles on him. He misses 20 to 30 games
*  every year. We've peaked with our, the East is better. The West is way, way, way better.
*  And we are paying for past performance. Now let's move on. Now.
*  They lucked into Butler too. I mean, they, Miami finds a way where, whether it's all the guys
*  going down there to start the heatles, they had the right situation. They had the right star in
*  place already. Remember when all of those guys did their extensions were like, why do those guys do
*  shorter rookie extensions? Like, why was that? Why was everyone but Carmella, Carmella never got
*  the memo, right? Right. Right. He wasn't on the text thread. So, and that was, that was the,
*  next extension. I don't, I don't believe that was the extension because LeBron came in,
*  seven years prior, but when I think about that, it's like, okay, I'll give you some credit,
*  but I don't know if it's just the heat way. Like the heat way was at the all time. It was a 52 week
*  high in 2023, the whole heat culture deal and all that kind of stuff. But sometimes I think there's
*  a mistake of just believing because of that and then figuring out a way to get off the white side
*  stuff and then getting Butler in there that they're just supposed to luck into the next one.
*  Well, you forgot Anthony Carter in 2003. That was the best one because that agent fucked up his
*  contract. They were able to get rid of them. Basically they, they were able to steal Lamar
*  Odom from the Quippers and then a year later get Shaq because they, cause Anthony Carter, basically.
*  So they've had some, some positive luck moments that they took advantage of.
*  Well, big time too, because the Shaq part of it, remember it's cause he wasn't going to get the
*  extension from LA. LA makes their choice. They move on from Shaq and then Miami's like, we'll do it.
*  And it completely works out. But those last couple of years for Shaq were going to be dark. And then
*  luckily they had a new owner syndrome deal in Phoenix with Robert Sarbrick being like, this is
*  going to be awesome. It's like, this goes against everything that you guys have been doing basketball
*  wise here for a while. So you could go through a bunch of franchises and say, Hey, that worked out.
*  Or they got lucky. There were all these different things, but it feels like Miami more than any other
*  franchise. We just assume, I guess it's going to happen again and we can read the breadcrumbs
*  and all the flirting and all the stuff that Butler wants to do. And he's a difficult guy. He's a
*  difficult guy, but he's their guy and he was their best option at the time. I don't, I just never see
*  them in rebuild mode. I just don't. I mean, not with Bam. Well, Bam's, yeah. Not with Bam and Spolstra
*  where you're like, no, I'm agreeing with you. You have Bam and Spolstra and you have some good
*  peripheral pieces and then you have the Butler piece. And it's like, but they still need that
*  one score. And at least Butler's that whatever his limitations are and the frustrations of how he
*  treats the regular season and maybe talking to yourself into a ceiling that's a little bit
*  higher based on the run of 23. I love Bam. Every team should want to Bam, right? He's like one of
*  those guys, but I don't know how aggressive they would get. Maybe they're just afraid of what
*  Butler's going to be like without an extension. And that's what they already know and why this
*  is already happening. Or it's like the classic little both sides winking at other people at the
*  bar, but ultimately they're going to get back together. But I feel like there's a lot of smoke.
