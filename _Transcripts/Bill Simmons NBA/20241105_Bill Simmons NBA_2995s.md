# NBA Power Poll: Messy Bucks, No-Bench Lakers, Fun Warriors + an OKC Leap | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs)
*  There are no NBA games today, which is the perfect time to do a power pole. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=0.0s)]
*  After two weeks, we did this last year. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=3.52s)]
*  We did this the year before counting backwards with tears from 30 to one. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=5.74s)]
*  We have a nice little two week sample size here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=11.68s)]
*  So first category, there's only one team in it and it's called poop for coop. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=14.22s)]
*  You could also have talked to me in a sag for flag. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  You could have talked me into a poop scooper for Cooper, but I think poop [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=23.92s)]
*  for coop is, is the right one for this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=27.38s)]
*  And this is basically just Utah 30th offense minus 14.4 net rating already. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=29.36s)]
*  Um, I don't know what's going on with this team. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=36.44s)]
*  And I think the thing is they know they want to stink. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=39.6s)]
*  One of the things they're doing, they're putting a lot of eggs in the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=43.4s)]
*  Quiente George basket, who I actually. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=45.84s)]
*  Not against like he might have potential down the road, but he has the ball a lot. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  He's just shooting 33%, 29% from three. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=52.92s)]
*  Uh, when he's out there minus 22.3 net and he's a young player that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  you're getting good reps for us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=60.92s)]
*  So it's actually like, he's probably one of the best tanking assets in the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  league, cause maybe four years from now, it'd be really good. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=64.92s)]
*  There is no path for this team to be good. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=68.04s)]
*  They're in a conference that's way better than the other conference. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=69.94s)]
*  If you look at the standings, I think there's only two teams in the East [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=72.76s)]
*  that have an above 500 record right now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=75.72s)]
*  The West is absolutely ridiculously loaded and Utah is the stinker in the West. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=77.48s)]
*  So they are number 30. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=83.64s)]
*  Next category is the pre tankers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=85.72s)]
*  I think these are teams that haven't admitted yet that they want to tank. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=88.84s)]
*  But they'll get there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=93.84s)]
*  They're going to get there, especially as Cooper flag starts looking better [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=95.24s)]
*  and better in these Duke games. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=97.76s)]
*  Number 29, Toronto. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=100.28s)]
*  So 29th in defense and it feels worse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=102.56s)]
*  They've lost Scotty Barnes for at least three weeks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=105.48s)]
*  Rossella talked about this when we did the over under podcast. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=109.4s)]
*  There's really no path for them to be good, especially defensively. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=112.04s)]
*  I don't really know what this team is. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=116.36000000000001s)]
*  I do know that I like Grady Dick. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=118.04s)]
*  So you got that going, but I wonder like, as the season goes along, does [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  Yaka Perto become a trade piece for them? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, that not a very fun team to watch. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=125.68s)]
*  Not a fan. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=127.84s)]
*  Number 28, Washington, who I watched a lot of last night in the, uh, the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  golden state game, which they hung around, they hung around. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=134.36s)]
*  They might've nailed the draft. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=136.56s)]
*  House was texting me about this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=138.60000000000002s)]
*  This is the 2024 draft, legendarily bad. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=139.96s)]
*  I don't think we have a rookie averaging 11 points a game right now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  And, uh, and everybody is either kind of lukewarm or kind of okay with who they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=147.08s)]
*  picked the Washington's fired up. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=152.52s)]
*  Sar, Bob Carrington, George, who's grown to six foot eight. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=154.32s)]
*  They were talking about how his growth plates, he might be able to get to six [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=158.28s)]
*  foot 10, the guy with average, like seven points a game last year at Miami. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=161.32s)]
*  Um, but they, this team plays hard. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=164.88s)]
*  Draymond called it out after the game last night. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  He just talked about that was the hardest he'd seen a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=169.88s)]
*  wizard's team play in a while. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=172.92s)]
*  Now that's going to change when Kyle Kuzma comes back. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=174.44s)]
*  Uh, shots of Kyle, sorry. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=176.88s)]
*  But I also like Kula Bali. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=179.88s)]
*  I like kiss Bert and there's something here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=181.28s)]
*  So this is like a very fun, bad team that I think at least has a little bit of hope. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=183.72s)]
*  Maybe get another top three pick. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=189.12s)]
*  Not against this team. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=192.16s)]
*  Number 27, Charlotte 30th defensive rating feels worse. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=193.76s)]
*  This is a team you can catch for a quarter on league pass and they look great, but, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  uh, but ultimately they can't stop anybody. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  LaMelo, good stats, bad team. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  We might have to wait the five year waiting period for the hall of fame. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=207.72s)]
*  He's putting up giant stats and the team loses. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=211.48s)]
*  And this has just been his entire career. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=213.76s)]
*  Now you could argue if you just switched him with Halliburton in Indiana, could [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=215.56s)]
*  he be really good on the Pacers? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=220.12s)]
*  Probably, but I'm just from a results standpoint, it has not been great for him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=221.48s)]
*  And then the last team, number 26 and the pre tankers, the Atlanta Hawks. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=225.2s)]
*  Oh no, they can't tank. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=230.92s)]
*  They don't have their pick. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  Yikes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=235.56s)]
*  Uh, I really liked this team on opening night. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=236.32s)]
*  Since then they've lost Bogdanovic, they lost Hunter, they lost Buffkin. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  They basically lost a lot of their wings, which I think is what made them interesting. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=242.72s)]
*  And they also are having Troy Young's worst year ever. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=248.0s)]
*  Like all his shooting stats have been awful. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  I still kind of like this team. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=253.48s)]
*  I want to see when everybody comes back, but the problem for them is there's, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=255.48s)]
*  you could say if they had their number one pick, it'd be like, oh shit, well, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=259.28s)]
*  let's zag the other way, but you can't zag when you don't have a pick. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=262.2s)]
*  So, uh, they're in the pre tanker category without a first run pick. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what to tell you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=269.08s)]
*  Next category, potentially frisky, probably harmless. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=270.0s)]
*  Portland, number 25. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=275.68s)]
*  They have size. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=277.68s)]
*  They have wings who can create shots. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=279.32s)]
*  They have scoot who is starting to go downhill a little bit more. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=282.8s)]
*  Rossella and I, this is, uh, probably one third of our tax because I think we [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=287.8s)]
*  owned all the scoot stock at this point. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  It's it's like a dollar stock, but, um, he looks better than he did last year [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=294.68s)]
*  and they kind of need them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=299.68s)]
*  I'm not against this team. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  I actually kind of like watching them. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=303.76s)]
*  I think they've been a really strong league pass team on the west coast. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=305.36s)]
*  28th on offense feels like that could be better. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=308.56s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=310.88s)]
*  They'll probably end up tanking one more time, but, um, there's some pieces here [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=312.08s)]
*  and there's some trade bay pieces too. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=315.68s)]
*  Plus Robert Williams coming back. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=317.08s)]
*  Number 24, Detroit beat the Lakers last night. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=318.76s)]
*  Good news for them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  They have a coach that's not in a coma. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=322.84s)]
*  So that's a bonus. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=325.24s)]
*  Um, Kate and Ivy averaging almost 43 points a game and this team rebounds. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=326.92s)]
*  They're out rebounding teams by seven a game. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=332.04s)]
*  They were, they were kind of standing up to the Lakers physically last night and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=334.12s)]
*  they legitimately beat the Lakers. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  I didn't even think like Detroit played amazing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=339.64s)]
*  I just think they had a deeper team with some size and even though Davis went off, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=342.52s)]
*  they still won the game. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=347.08s)]
*  Detroit's interesting because Tobias hasn't shot well yet. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=347.88s)]
*  I think he's shooting like 18% from three. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=350.76s)]
*  So I'm watching them because that's like a night to night. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=353.0s)]
*  They're like a 10 point underdog against whoever and they win the game. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  Like there's something dangerous about them and Kate's been good, but he's still [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=361.2s)]
*  at five turnovers a game. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=365.36s)]
*  I feel like there's another level for him. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=366.68s)]
*  I kind of like Detroit. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=368.2s)]
*  Chicago number 23. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  This has been a league pass revelation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=371.56s)]
*  They are first in pace. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=374.08s)]
*  They're 28th last year. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=376.0s)]
*  They just push the ball and shoot threes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=378.12s)]
*  They're 43.1, three point, uh, three, three point shots a game. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=379.8s)]
*  They're making over 16. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=385.28s)]
*  They're shooting 38%. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=386.76s)]
*  Levine is averaging 22 a game, 50, 46, 82 percentages, and just dying for [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=388.56s)]
*  somebody to panic trade for it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=395.12s)]
*  Maybe it'd be the Lakers on the flip side. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=396.32s)]
*  Somebody is scoring 70 points on them this year. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=398.52s)]
*  And I don't know who it is. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=401.44s)]
*  There's about nine candidates, but they're going to give up a 70 point game this [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=402.32s)]
*  year because they can't stop anything. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=405.84s)]
*  But I kind of like how they play. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  They play like, uh, like one of those European Olympic teams that just pushes [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=408.84s)]
*  the ball that has a center that can, can pass and create shots and, uh, they can [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=412.76s)]
*  do small ball lineups and I've enjoyed the bulls thumbs up. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=417.52s)]
*  Good to see Josh Giddy finally, uh, on a team that's given him the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=421.76s)]
*  car keys a little bit too. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=424.44s)]
*  Number 22, the biggest surprise of the season. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=425.56s)]
*  Brooklyn now house and I went over for them 18 and a half wins before the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=428.0s)]
*  season, because we thought they had a lot of competent basketball players. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=432.6s)]
*  And as the season has unfolded here for two weeks, Schroeder, Klaxon, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=438.28s)]
*  cam Thomas is like 27 a game cam Johnson, Phinney Smith, the 20 minutes of Simmons [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=444.32s)]
*  a game, like they're actually a little too competent and you think about the trades [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=450.64s)]
*  that they made before the year where they got their own pick back and it seemed [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=454.68s)]
*  like there was this whole tanking plan. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=458.32s)]
*  I don't know what they're going to do now because the East just isn't good. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=461.84s)]
*  Like we have, you know, seven, eight teams and then it's like this massive [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=465.47999999999996s)]
*  drop off to everybody else. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=470.24s)]
*  And there's going to be a plan team that's like, all right, fine. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=471.76s)]
*  We'll make the plan. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=474.52s)]
*  It might be Brooklyn. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=475.96s)]
*  Shooters playing great shooter is a legitimate trade asset. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=476.88s)]
*  I think he's at 12 million. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=479.84s)]
*  Uh, he's a fun one for a bunch of different teams. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=481.56s)]
*  I would have said Orlando, but I kind of want them to just ride with Anthony [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  Black anyway, could they package Schroeder and Phinney Smith to the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=487.44s)]
*  Lakers for the DLO contract? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=491.4s)]
*  Uh, Christian would something else and get one of those first round picks from [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=494.28s)]
*  the Lakers that they're still hoarding. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=498.0s)]
*  They probably could. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=499.79999999999995s)]
*  Would that be a good trade for the Lakers? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  It actually would be, uh, I'll get to that later, but Brooklyn at 22 and you [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=502.44s)]
*  could make a case, they should be higher because I have some teams that have [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=507.32s)]
*  been playing awful ahead of them. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=509.92s)]
*  Uh, number 21, the last team in this group, San Antonio, 28th offensive [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=511.68s)]
*  rating, ninth on defense, the Wemby on off stats are like genuinely hilarious. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=516.76s)]
*  I think they're like, it's like a plus 40 swing or something crazy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=522.0s)]
*  They're shooting 32% from three. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=525.4s)]
*  Dem Vassell has been out. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=527.48s)]
*  Uh, Sohan made a, made a little mini leap now that they're not [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=529.12s)]
*  forcing him to bring the ball up. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=532.12s)]
*  I'm not sure what this team is yet, but defensively, um, they're not nothing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  They blew a huge lead to the Clippers last night. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=539.36s)]
*  I haven't loved what I've seen from Wemby this year. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=541.32s)]
*  He doesn't really see me any different to me from last year. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=543.28s)]
*  And I was talking to, uh, Termini and Eddie about this on their [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=545.44s)]
*  serious show the other day. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=548.24s)]
*  It just feels like he's too far from the basket again. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=549.72s)]
*  And last year they rectified this in the, like basically the last two months of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=552.72s)]
*  the season, they just had him around the basket more where he can use his size, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=556.64s)]
*  his length, his long arms, his pretty Kruger arms and just kind of be around [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=560.32s)]
*  the rim and this year they, they seem like they've doubled down on making [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=564.32s)]
*  him more of a ball hander. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=568.2s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=569.32s)]
*  So Chris Paul, not washed. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=570.5200000000001s)]
*  I can't say he's the point God anymore, but not terrible. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=576.36s)]
*  We'll see whether he makes sense for them or somebody else, but the West is so good. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=582.2s)]
*  It's probably going to make sense for them to, uh, to try to tank and do [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=585.6s)]
*  one more tanking session. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=589.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  The next category is fantastic. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=591.08s)]
*  There's five teams in it and it's called panic time with three exclamation points. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=593.1600000000001s)]
*  It's not just panic time. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=597.92s)]
*  It's panic time with three exclamation points. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=599.32s)]
*  Number 20, New Orleans, just guys keep getting hurt. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=602.32s)]
*  Murphy's been out the whole year. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=608.6800000000001s)]
*  Herb Jones got hurt. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=610.16s)]
*  CJ's out, which not the worst thing in the world. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=611.48s)]
*  Cause now it's Jordan Hawkins time. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  And I like Jordan Hawkins, even though he's not good on defense, but, uh, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=617.24s)]
*  missy's not bad as a center, but they still need a center and they have Ingram [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=620.32s)]
*  doing an, uh, an amazing trade bait season where he's basically 24 a night. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=625.12s)]
*  He's borderline 50, 40, 90 guy, and he's an expiring contract. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  And somebody will talk themselves into him because it doesn't seem [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=634.72s)]
*  like they want to pay him. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=637.2s)]
*  I guess the big, I, and it's early, it's two weeks, but the thing that's [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=639.2s)]
*  concerning to me is Zion year five. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=643.2800000000001s)]
*  Is it year five? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=645.84s)]
*  Year five, year six. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=647.48s)]
*  Can't remember how many years he's been in the league. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=650.24s)]
*  Field goal percentage is rough. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=653.36s)]
*  Remember he was like a 60% field goal guy. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=654.76s)]
*  So last three years, 61% last year, 57% and this year's 44% and his [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=657.68s)]
*  shots just not going in. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=663.56s)]
*  And I actually thought he would be a better score as his career age. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=664.76s)]
*  She seemed like he was in good shape. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=670.2s)]
*  So I'm just watching that it's early, uh, in general, super early with New Orleans. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  They have a bunch of trade possibilities. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=675.84s)]
*  They year six for Zion. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=678.52s)]
*  So it reminds me, um, they have a bunch of, of, of picks. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=679.88s)]
*  And things they can do. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=685.0799999999999s)]
*  The problem in the West is it might make more sense for them to punt on the year. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=687.52s)]
*  If they fall way behind with all these injuries, we'll see what happens. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=692.56s)]
*  Not counting them out yet. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=695.68s)]
*  Milwaukee number 19. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=696.76s)]
*  They have, they're tied for the worst record in the league. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=698.68s)]
*  They're one in six. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=700.52s)]
*  They're over under has dropped to 45 and a half on fan duel. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=701.88s)]
*  And I watched their last two games closely against the Cavs, including last [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=706.68s)]
*  night where they did not have Yannis. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=710.76s)]
*  They're basically the Midwest Lakers. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=712.48s)]
*  They have an awesome big man. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=714.8s)]
*  They have an aging offensive star who doesn't play defense. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=718.52s)]
*  They have nobody else on the team who can play defense. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=722.16s)]
*  They have no bench and unlike the Lakers, there's no fixes because if you look at [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=725.12s)]
*  what they can do, they can trade Dame, I guess they have Conaton and Portis at 22 [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=731.4s)]
*  million combined for this year and next year and Portis has been really bad this [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=737.24s)]
*  year. The net rating stats with him are terrible. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  The eye test defensively, he's really hurting them and that's really all they [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=744.32s)]
*  can do is package those guys together with I don't even know what, because I [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=748.9200000000001s)]
*  don't have any picks left. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=752.52s)]
*  I keep thinking about Doc, who was in such a great spot here in LA. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=755.8000000000001s)]
*  He was coming on my podcast. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=760.44s)]
*  He was playing golf. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=762.32s)]
*  He was doing TV great times. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=763.36s)]
*  And then Yannis got dangled in front of him and he jumped at it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=765.88s)]
*  And he's on this team that I don't see any conceivable way. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=769.7199999999999s)]
*  This team is a contender. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=773.68s)]
*  I felt that way fairly strongly before the year, except for the Yannis piece. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=775.52s)]
*  Yannis has been awesome and they're one in six. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=780.04s)]
*  I don't see a fix defensively. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=783.16s)]
*  We've talked about it already in this pod, but it's, it's an atrocious defensive [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  team. You look at every night after night, after night, after night. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=791.04s)]
*  Last night it was Garland. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=794.16s)]
*  Garland was getting whatever he wanted. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=795.4s)]
*  They had no chance. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=796.8399999999999s)]
*  They're playing guys in crunch time that would not even play for the Celtics or [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=798.28s)]
*  the Thunder. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=801.84s)]
*  So I don't know what the fix is. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=802.96s)]
*  I'm not counting out anything with Yannis yet. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=804.64s)]
*  That's why I have them 19 and not 28 or 27 where they should be. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=807.56s)]
*  But really rough, really rough with no fixes and Doc come back to the podcast. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=811.12s)]
*  Just move back to LA. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=817.92s)]
*  Make, make believe this was like a dream sequence on the Sopranos. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=819.12s)]
*  Just come back. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=822.2s)]
*  Get out of there. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=823.8s)]
*  Number 18, the LA Clippers. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=825.64s)]
*  I saw these guys on Saturday night. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=827.24s)]
*  They played Oklahoma city. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=830.16s)]
*  They played really well for about a quarter and a half, two quarters. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=831.6s)]
*  And unfortunately for them, OKC is, is just the ridiculous beast of a team where [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=836.32s)]
*  they bring in their bench and their bench is Alex Caruso and Kason Wallace. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  And those are their defensive guards coming off the bench. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=849.04s)]
*  So poor Harden who is having a great season, like for him, he's averaging [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=851.12s)]
*  almost a triple double is 21, nine and 10, three point shots down to below 30%. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=856.08s)]
*  And he's on a team that has no chance to do anything, but he's having a great time. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=862.4s)]
*  He has the ball at the time. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=865.56s)]
*  He's with Norm Powell, who's somehow averaging 25 points a game. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=867.12s)]
*  Not sure that's sustainable, but you, you go against the team like OKC and you [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=869.96s)]
*  realize what a chasm it is where the Clippers, where they are without Kawhi [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=875.04s)]
*  versus teams like the Celtics and OKC and Cleveland, these teams that have [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=880.72s)]
*  really good starting fives and depth and the Clippers are a million miles away. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=885.4s)]
*  I still don't understand why they didn't sign Paul George. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=889.04s)]
*  Um, I, when you go into that arena, the amount of money they spent, which it [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=892.0s)]
*  just seems like one of those like crazy mansions you see in the Rob report where [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=898.36s)]
*  you're like, wow, that guy spent $200 million on a house. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=901.7199999999999s)]
*  That's what Ballmer did with that arena. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=904.5999999999999s)]
*  And yet Paul George, he was like, ah, too rich for my blood. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=906.52s)]
*  Doesn't really make sense. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=911.16s)]
*  This team has no path. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=912.28s)]
*  It was weird seeing Kawhi there on the, uh, on the bench, just kind of being [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=913.44s)]
*  like, Hey guys, go get them. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=918.72s)]
*  And, um, I don't see a path for him to be an NBA player anymore. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=921.44s)]
*  It just seems like there's been too many knee injuries. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=926.6400000000001s)]
*  So anyway, um, the biggest problem with them just as a night to night team, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=929.44s)]
*  because they're really good defensively when they want to be, but they're [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=934.0400000000001s)]
*  starting lineups terrible. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=936.96s)]
*  Nobody can create a shot for anyone else except for Harden. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=938.1600000000001s)]
*  And, um, they're not a very good three point shooting team either 12 for 34, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=941.64s)]
*  basically every game for the season. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=945.9599999999999s)]
*  So this is going to be a lottery team. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=947.4799999999999s)]
*  I had them under 37, F wins in the over, under as a lock. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=950.12s)]
*  And I still feel good about that because I do not see enough talent on this team. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=954.3199999999999s)]
*  Number 17, sadly Orlando. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=958.1999999999999s)]
*  I would have had them number six before the Palo injury. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=961.52s)]
*  Just a huge bummer. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=963.8399999999999s)]
*  Um, they're saying four to six weeks, which in NBA speak means two months. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=965.88s)]
*  That ruins his all NBA chances. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=972.76s)]
*  Cause he's not going to play enough games. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=974.56s)]
*  I think it also ruins their chance to be a top three seed, which they absolutely [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=976.28s)]
*  positively would have been no question now offensively they're challenged. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=980.92s)]
*  And I guess if you're going to spin into a positive, no Palo means, Hey [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=985.88s)]
*  Franz, let's see it step up. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=989.6s)]
*  Can you be a crunch time guy near the end of games? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=991.92s)]
*  Anthony black, can you create some shots in the fourth quarter? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=994.12s)]
*  Sugs. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=998.16s)]
*  How much is in there? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=999.24s)]
*  I mean, I have Sugs Sugs to me is now a top 50 guy. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  Like we're handing in ringer 100 next week. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1003.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't know how high Sugs is going to be, but he is in that 40 to 50 range. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1006.1999999999999s)]
*  At least he's probably the best defensive guard in the league. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1010.76s)]
*  And, um, offensively he's gotten better every year and he's, I think 18 points a [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1014.24s)]
*  game and creating offense for them sometimes. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1019.3199999999999s)]
*  So could they patch something together that would give them confidence [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1022.44s)]
*  when Palo comes back? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1026.44s)]
*  Maybe I was thinking, speaking of Sugs, the 2021 redraft, if you're going to do it. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1027.48s)]
*  Just quickly, this would probably have been a better podcast. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1033.28s)]
*  But I'm just going to go quick. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1035.68s)]
*  Cause I was like, where would Sugs go if they redrafted that draft? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1036.6000000000001s)]
*  Mowby, I think is still first. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1039.96s)]
*  And I'm not just saying that because I'm over leveraged with Evan Mowby stock. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1042.0800000000002s)]
*  He's been awesome this year for him. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1045.2s)]
*  Kate, I think has to be second. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1048.2s)]
*  And I have Sugs third. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1051.04s)]
*  Sugs was the fifth pick in the draft. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1052.52s)]
*  I think he goes three. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1054.1200000000001s)]
*  If we do it again, Jaylen Johnson, I have fourth. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1054.96s)]
*  Shen Goons fifth, he went 16th in the draft. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1059.28s)]
*  Jaylen Johnson went 20. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1062.56s)]
*  So those would be the top five. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  Then I got Scotty, Trey Murphy, Franz, Herb Jones, Jaylen Green as three year [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1065.52s)]
*  run of putting Herb Jones ahead of Jaylen Green for me, and then Josh Giddy. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1075.16s)]
*  I think that would be the redraft. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1079.1200000000001s)]
*  Now people would argue with the Jaylen Green part, maybe put him up. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1080.44s)]
*  I want, and I'm willing to accept that argument. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1083.8400000000001s)]
*  I want to see a couple more weeks because that Houston team as we'll get to, um, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1086.1200000000001s)]
*  after the break is still trying to figure out what they're doing. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1090.48s)]
*  Anyway, the point is, I think if you're doing that draft again, Sugs would be [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1092.52s)]
*  third because he's that good and he's been that important to them and he's [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1095.68s)]
*  that unusual as a player. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1098.96s)]
*  I mean, could he be the third best player in the title team? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1100.24s)]
*  I think he could. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1103.0800000000002s)]
*  Number 16, the Lakers. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1104.68s)]
*  25th defensive rating. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1109.72s)]
*  I left at a trade game last night thinking, how do we get Anthony Davis more help? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1111.52s)]
*  That was a joke. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1117.32s)]
*  Um, D-Low Reeves, LeBron, Rui and Davis as your crunch time team. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1118.8s)]
*  Good luck getting stops. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1127.2s)]
*  If you're a wing or a point guard, it's much like the Milwaukee situation. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1130.44s)]
*  You're scoring on everybody that team has. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1134.0s)]
*  Really the reason, I mean, they beat Phoenix twice because Davis just owns [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1136.08s)]
*  Snurkage and both of those games, you know, are pretty close, but the real [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1140.72s)]
*  reason their record isn't as bad as I think it probably should be considering [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1145.04s)]
*  their bench is so bad that JJ could become a player coach, like what we used [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1148.96s)]
*  to have in the 1970s and he'd probably be like the eighth man on the team. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1153.52s)]
*  The reason their record is better than maybe it should be. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  And maybe. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1161.04s)]
*  The eye test says that they're a little better than I think they are is they [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1161.68s)]
*  just shoot a ton of free throws. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1165.2800000000002s)]
*  They're shooting almost 10 free throws attempts more than their opponents. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  9.7 to be exact for the season, 207 free throw attempts to 132. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1172.4s)]
*  I'm positive they don't go to the rim that much more than everybody else, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  but that's part of what happens when you're the Lakers. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1182.1200000000001s)]
*  You and you have LeBron on your team and you're 22, you're going to be [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1184.6000000000001s)]
*  the best free throw attempt ever. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1187.4s)]
*  And you have LeBron on your team and you're 22, you're going to get some calls. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1188.96s)]
*  But, uh, with the free throw attempt luck that they've had, if you want to call it [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1192.96s)]
*  luck, could also call it something else. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1197.04s)]
*  Um, I think the fact that they're basically a 500 team, not a great sign [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1200.24s)]
*  for the Lakers and this is another much like Milwaukee, what's the fix? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1206.4s)]
*  Like you hope Jared Vanderbilt comes back. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1210.44s)]
*  That's not going to help them with three points shooting. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1212.92s)]
*  Um, Rui, I've been saying this, especially after the first two games and really [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1215.48s)]
*  looked really good and all the Waker friends like, Oh, Rui, Oh, Rui, Rui's [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1219.8799999999999s)]
*  trick or treat. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1224.4399999999998s)]
*  That's just who he is. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1225.28s)]
*  Rui is the same guy who will go one for five in a game like he did last night. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1226.36s)]
*  That's just who he is. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1229.84s)]
*  He's in his like mid twenties now. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1231.1999999999998s)]
*  He's been in the league for a few years. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1233.6399999999999s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1234.8799999999999s)]
*  You just got to accept it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1235.56s)]
*  So, um, the defense, the health of LeBron in year 22, can he play 70 [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1237.24s)]
*  games Davis fell down last night. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1244.16s)]
*  It looked like he was going to be out. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1246.8000000000002s)]
*  Then he got back up, but I, I still, they over under was 42 and a half. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1247.88s)]
*  JJ is definitely a better coach than Darvin. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1253.0s)]
*  Him. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1254.88s)]
*  They might need to start playing connect more. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1256.1200000000001s)]
*  That's not going to help with their defense, but at least it'll help them [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1257.8400000000001s)]
*  with the shooting. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1260.6000000000001s)]
*  They still have a DLO trade to make, which I'm sure we'll, we'll be getting [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1262.0s)]
*  passive aggressive hints about fairly soon. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1266.16s)]
*  I have it on my calendar for November 15th. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1269.52s)]
*  But, uh, but they, to me, they, they just seem pretty far away from the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1272.4s)]
*  best teams in the league at this point. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1277.2s)]
*  So, so Rudy said that, uh, during the break that the Scotty Barnes fans are [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1278.8400000000001s)]
*  going to be mad that I had Suggs over him in a redraft and you know what? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1283.6000000000001s)]
*  I put real thought into it and I'd rather have Suggs. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1286.5600000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1288.88s)]
*  I think Suggs is a winning player. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  We'll see with Scotty Barnes. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1290.88s)]
*  He might be, but I haven't seen it yet. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1291.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1293.68s)]
*  The top 15, this tier is called feeling it out and I'm not even sure what we're [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1294.92s)]
*  feeling, but, uh, we have number 15 to Miami Heat. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1300.88s)]
*  They beat Washington and Charlotte and Detroit. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1308.2s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1310.96s)]
*  I think it's very possible. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1313.3200000000002s)]
*  They're the good bad team, much like the Denver Broncos. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  I said this on terminating Eddie's show and I genuinely believe it. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1318.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it's over for these guys. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1324.64s)]
*  I think the league just got better and they stayed the same and I watched them [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1326.96s)]
*  and they don't seem that special. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1330.44s)]
*  Um, defensively, I don't think they, they seem like, you know, really good or [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1332.96s)]
*  anything crunch time. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1338.16s)]
*  I always feel like the guy and the other team has just as good of a chance of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1339.8400000000001s)]
*  scoring, whoever the best guy is that they're playing as the guys that they [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1343.1200000000001s)]
*  have, and they just seem like that Mr. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1345.76s)]
*  Window, you know, which was a great window, by the way, they made the finals in [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1350.96s)]
*  2020, they made the finals in. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1355.16s)]
*  2023, you know, they had a really nice four year run. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1357.68s)]
*  They battled Boston. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1360.76s)]
*  This was great, but now Butler's 35, you know, they put a lot of, a lot of eggs [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1362.2s)]
*  in the a Yovage basket. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1367.08s)]
*  I'm not seeing it. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1368.52s)]
*  And, uh, you know, there's, there's panic trades to make like would Milwaukee [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1370.12s)]
*  accept hero and Duncan Robinson and a pick for Dame tomorrow? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1376.56s)]
*  They probably would, but, um, I don't see it with them. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1380.2s)]
*  And I don't think that's a controversial opinion. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1385.32s)]
*  I just think that I just feel like they're at a different phase of whatever [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1387.08s)]
*  journey they're on. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1391.7199999999998s)]
*  They're going to be mentioned in the honest a ton, like get ready for that [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1392.4799999999998s)]
*  machine to start the, and basically that would be out of, I would have to be in [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1395.8s)]
*  the trade, um, plus picks and you know, is that a better situation than the one [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1400.1999999999998s)]
*  you honest is in now if, if, if bam's in the trade, I don't know, but, um, I think [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1406.9599999999998s)]
*  this team's going to be a lot of trade rumors and I'm going to be really [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1412.12s)]
*  interested to see if Butler's on this team in February, because if I had to bet, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1415.6s)]
*  I would say it's 50 50 and I would probably bet on no, we will see. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1419.04s)]
*  Memphis number 14. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1425.12s)]
*  This is a classic feeling it out team. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1427.52s)]
*  Um, you know, jazz, not even playing 30 minutes of game yet. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1429.76s)]
*  Last night, he had a couple of jaw highlight, highlight real plays that only he can do. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1433.84s)]
*  I think he's ready to take his corner back from Edwards as the most beloved [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1438.56s)]
*  under 26, uh, American guy in the league, their 10th offensive rating. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1442.72s)]
*  They lucked out again, but it's not luck because Memphis keeps doing this, but [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1447.68s)]
*  Scotty Pippen Jr. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1451.3600000000001s)]
*  Who I saw in person last year when I took my daughter to an absolutely terrible [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1452.4s)]
*  Celtics Grizzlies game and Scotty Pippen Jr. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1455.88s)]
*  Just looked like an NBA player and that kind of filed it away. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1460.76s)]
*  I was like, Hmm, that's interesting. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1463.76s)]
*  Um, he's turned into a legitimately good backup player and then Huff, who I'd [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1465.68s)]
*  never heard of and I watched the NBA every night and I barely remember that he [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1471.3999999999999s)]
*  was in Denver last year and they've turned him into a really good backup big, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1475.08s)]
*  hard to believe the nuggets didn't have use for him. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1479.36s)]
*  Somebody get Calvin Booze some coffee. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1481.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, we'll see. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1483.8799999999999s)]
*  Bain is hurt. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1485.6s)]
*  Smarts hurt. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1486.56s)]
*  Now smart was 23% field goal, 17% from three before he got hurt and looked [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1487.48s)]
*  slow and doughy to me. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1493.68s)]
*  We'll see if he's at a different point in his career because I have a feeling he [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1496.88s)]
*  is, but you know, maybe they have three, four months to ramp them up and get [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1500.04s)]
*  them where they need them to be. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1503.68s)]
*  This team, you could pick any direction for them and I would believe it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1505.08s)]
*  You could tell me they're never going to get their shit together. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1509.64s)]
*  You could tell me they're going to win 49 games. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1511.56s)]
*  I'll believe anything. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1513.4s)]
*  Um, pretty fun league pass team though. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1515.12s)]
*  All their games seem to be close. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1517.2s)]
*  Um, I don't think they're the same defensively as they used to be, but we'll [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1518.88s)]
*  see when they get everybody back. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1521.92s)]
*  The last feeling about team is Philadelphia. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1523.68s)]
*  So Paul George came back last night against the sons and some really [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1527.0800000000002s)]
*  interesting crunch time stuff with them. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1532.6000000000001s)]
*  Cause the sons couldn't stop Maxey. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1534.44s)]
*  And then in the last four minutes, Maxey just never had the ball. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1537.3200000000002s)]
*  Yabaseli took a few shots in a row and then the biggest shot of the game, Paul [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1540.5600000000002s)]
*  George took and it was a contested 21 footer and of course he missed it. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1543.76s)]
*  And I think he was four for 14 for the game. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1549.16s)]
*  And I was watching Maxey's body language, just standing on the side as Paul [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1552.48s)]
*  George decided the game and he was kind of like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1555.72s)]
*  It made me think when a beat comes back, that's going to be even more notable [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1560.04s)]
*  with what happens there. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1566.4s)]
*  I was thinking about Philly a lot before this season. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1567.5600000000002s)]
*  I meant to say this on the over under pod and I didn't, but when you put like [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1569.8000000000002s)]
*  three guys together like this, there has to be some sort of sacrifice in [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1574.24s)]
*  place with the three, right? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1579.16s)]
*  No, think about the 2008 Celtics is a good example, not to bring the Celtics [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1581.4s)]
*  into this, I swear I wasn't looking for an excuse, but go back and go back and [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1585.0s)]
*  read anything about that team that year. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1589.04s)]
*  You can watch the documentary we have coming six months, five months, four [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1591.64s)]
*  months, whenever it is. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1596.04s)]
*  Um, KG, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Doc brought them in and Doc was like, you [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1597.16s)]
*  guys are going to have to sacrifice, you know, all get to shoot 20 shots a game [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1605.32s)]
*  anymore. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1608.64s)]
*  They were all at the point of their career that they're ready to make [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1609.44s)]
*  sacrifices because they'd all done a bunch of great stuff on their own. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1612.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1616.0s)]
*  Paul Pierce had been the best part in the Celtics for almost a decade. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1616.24s)]
*  He'd averaged 26 game. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1619.44s)]
*  Ray Allen had almost made the finals in 2001 and it got rudely taken from him [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1621.2s)]
*  by the refs and David Stern. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1625.1200000000001s)]
*  We don't talk about that now, but he had been a real guy in his own and, and [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1626.4s)]
*  had plenty of shots. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1631.0800000000002s)]
*  Garnett had been an MVP in, in, in Minnesota in 2004 and just wanted to win. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1632.72s)]
*  And all those guys were at the point of their career where they wanted to give [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1639.8799999999999s)]
*  up something. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1642.48s)]
*  So you look at this Sixers team, you could argue Paul George is at that point [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1643.12s)]
*  in his career, right? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1646.84s)]
*  He's been on a bunch of good teams. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1647.6s)]
*  He's been close. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1649.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe that's somebody who will sacrifice. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1650.4399999999998s)]
*  Embiid, um, no comment. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1653.28s)]
*  And then Maxey is the one that's interesting because when you're, when [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1657.8799999999999s)]
*  you're asking three guys to sacrifice and be, all right, this game, you're [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1661.68s)]
*  going to be the one that stands in the side. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1665.4s)]
*  You're going to be the one that only shoots 12 times. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1666.92s)]
*  Maxey doesn't know who he is as a player yet. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1669.04s)]
*  He doesn't know how good he is yet. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1671.5600000000002s)]
*  He, for all he knows, he might be one of the 10 best players in the league a [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1673.48s)]
*  year from now, and he's just blossoming and figuring out like, what is the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1677.0s)]
*  ceiling? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1682.5600000000002s)]
*  How many floors does this go up? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1683.1200000000001s)]
*  And now you're asking him to sacrifice and he's sacrificing something that he [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1685.04s)]
*  hasn't even achieved yet. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1689.68s)]
*  So I'm just flagging it because when you're asking, um, young players who [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1691.68s)]
*  haven't hit their potential yet, and he's a special player, I think he's the [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1696.76s)]
*  most beloved sixer. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1700.96s)]
*  I don't think there's any question. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1702.04s)]
*  Um, I think if, if you're asking sixer fans, protect one person on this team, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1703.5600000000002s)]
*  they'll pick Maxey and he's still figuring out who he is as a player. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1707.44s)]
*  So from a sacrifice element, that's the main thing I'm watching. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1711.96s)]
*  You're asking three guys to sacrifice and they're not at the right point of [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1716.4s)]
*  their careers as a threesome yet. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1720.8s)]
*  The, the supporting cast, Yabba Selle, I think was a good signing. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1723.36s)]
*  I like Caleb Barton, not willing to rule this team out, especially when there's [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1727.12s)]
*  only two above 500 East teams right now. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1731.32s)]
*  The Embiid thing is just going to be a soap opera all season and they weren't [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1734.56s)]
*  honest about it before the year. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1737.8s)]
*  There had been rumors and they weren't even rumors because people were telling [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1739.44s)]
*  me this in September that his knee wasn't right. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1742.68s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1745.28s)]
*  Um, he's had a bunch of surgeries. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1746.24s)]
*  He's had a bunch of things happen to him and I just don't think you can count on [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1748.36s)]
*  him week to week as a reliable person is going to be in the rotation. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1752.8s)]
*  It only matters in the playoffs, but I also think this is what the Clippers did [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1755.96s)]
*  with Kawhi for four years and it never worked out. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1760.04s)]
*  So we'll see how it goes, but I'm really interested in the sacrifice piece of it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1762.48s)]
*  I was thinking about it last night as Maxey's just standing there in the side [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1766.24s)]
*  watching Paul George and Maxey's probably thinking this should be my team. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1769.24s)]
*  We'll see how it plays out. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1774.36s)]
*  Next category, trust the process. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1776.04s)]
*  Number 12 Sacramento fifth and offensive rating, even though they're [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1780.2s)]
*  only 33% from three, this is a team you watch them at the end of games and they [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1785.24s)]
*  almost have too many crunch time options, right? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1789.8400000000001s)]
*  They got Malik Monk, they have Fox and now they have DeRozan. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1792.0s)]
*  All three guys I really like with the ball with like a minute left in a one point [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1797.4s)]
*  game, so they have to navigate that piece. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1801.32s)]
*  They also, I don't love their bench, even though Herder is playing better this year. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1803.6s)]
*  Um, Wiles, Len McDermott, it just feels like a six man team and that's the [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1807.04s)]
*  pain on how you feel about Ellis, but you know, they missed on Davion Mitchell [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1811.9199999999998s)]
*  and in 2021 with the ninth pick, then they took Carter 13th in June and he's [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1815.8s)]
*  not coming back till some point to winter, but it feels like they're a guy short. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1824.0s)]
*  They have picks, they have things to trade. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1827.36s)]
*  I'm watching them. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1829.92s)]
*  That's a possible trade partner for Brooklyn, um, or any of these other teams [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1830.72s)]
*  that have some sort of veteran between like 9 million and 18 million Utah's [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1834.84s)]
*  another one with Clarkson and Sexton. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1839.56s)]
*  We'll see what they do. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1841.04s)]
*  Number 11, I have Indiana who has the 25th defensive rating and is just [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1842.68s)]
*  getting a weird Halliburton season. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1848.28s)]
*  He looked more like himself last night against Dallas. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1849.76s)]
*  He had a 24 and 12. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1851.8s)]
*  You think last year, the first 31 games of the year, he was 24 and 13. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1853.4s)]
*  50% shooting 41% from three and was probably the most fun guard in the league. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1857.96s)]
*  And then he got hurt. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1865.24s)]
*  It never really came back. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1866.6000000000001s)]
*  And this year before the Dallas game last night, he was 33%, 24% from three, 14 and [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1868.0s)]
*  seven, and it was worse than that. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1874.8s)]
*  Cause if you watched it, it didn't seem like he had the same confidence in his legs. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1877.44s)]
*  It didn't seem like he was going downhill the same way. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1882.2s)]
*  It didn't that crazy, crazy, crazy. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1884.6000000000001s)]
*  It didn't that crazy 25 foot, three point shot that he would take that [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1886.6s)]
*  always went in last year. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1890.24s)]
*  It didn't seem like he even thought it was going in this year. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1892.4399999999998s)]
*  So, um, you know, I'm not panicking about him yet, but it's notable that, uh, he [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1895.3999999999999s)]
*  hasn't been that good because Matthew came back 16 points a game for him and [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1901.08s)]
*  is a crunch time guy. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1905.84s)]
*  Niecement just got hurt. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1907.1599999999999s)]
*  Uh, not sure when he's coming back, but I'd still believe in these guys. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1908.9199999999998s)]
*  I have them 11th, but, um, really only because we haven't seen them all healthy [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1913.1200000000001s)]
*  yet, they had a couple of bench guys go down. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1918.4s)]
*  Um, I still believe in these guys and I still think night to night they're scary [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1920.68s)]
*  to play and they know who they are. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1924.96s)]
*  They have an identity. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1926.3600000000001s)]
*  They beat the Celtics and OT already. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1927.0800000000002s)]
*  So 11 seems right for them. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1929.24s)]
*  10th Houston, ninth in offense, 10 in defense for, uh, for the ratings. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1931.1200000000001s)]
*  They're shooting 43 is the game. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1937.68s)]
*  They're only making 32% partly because man VLIT has kind of sucked this year. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1939.0s)]
*  He's 28% from three. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1942.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm not positive. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1944.68s)]
*  He should be in their best lineup. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1945.72s)]
*  You could talk me into like them just going bigger and just playing, having [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1948.88s)]
*  Jalen green bring the ball up when there's four minutes left and just go with wings [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1952.56s)]
*  and size, it's a really interesting team to coach and I don't think Udoca knows [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1956.1200000000001s)]
*  who his guys are yet and he's been experimenting like Shen Goon. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1963.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, I think he played only 21 minutes in the Warriors game last night. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1965.8s)]
*  He played a bunch. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1968.52s)]
*  Um, he seems like he really likes, uh, Eason and, um, and Thompson and guess [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1970.08s)]
*  what, join the club because I really liked those guys too. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1978.84s)]
*  Those guys are hard to keep out of the game and crunch time because of the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1981.92s)]
*  defense and the versatility and the athleticism, I'm in Thompson. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1984.8s)]
*  I threw him in a Butler trade. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1988.8799999999999s)]
*  Uh, if they want to do a three for one, like, I don't know, a week ago, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1990.6399999999999s)]
*  I'd like to recant that. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1993.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1994.8s)]
*  He might be a top 40 trade value guy for me at this point, but I'm not sure what [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=1995.6s)]
*  their, what the version of their best team is yet and whether they need to [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2001.6399999999999s)]
*  turn Brooks and Cam Whitmore and I don't know what else into, in some picks into [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2006.6399999999999s)]
*  one more awesome piece or whether they just ride it this year because they're [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2013.3999999999999s)]
*  not going to win the title there. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2016.52s)]
*  Top five league past him. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2017.44s)]
*  Whitmore had a DNP on Monday night, which I thought was notable because I feel [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2020.44s)]
*  like they could get something for him. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2024.48s)]
*  I think he could really help somebody off the bench, but this is a team that [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2025.8s)]
*  has different looks night to night. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2030.68s)]
*  And I think they might be the league pass MVP for me. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2032.24s)]
*  I never know who's finishing games for them. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2035.24s)]
*  Shungun might have a 30, 20 any night. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2037.44s)]
*  Jalen green might have 40 points any night. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2039.96s)]
*  Every time Reed Shepard's in I'm mesmerized, um, because he's basically [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2042.28s)]
*  Mark Price on the, uh, 1991 Cavaliers back really like this Houston team. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2046.92s)]
*  They're in a great spot. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2053.28s)]
*  Congratulations Houston fence. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2054.12s)]
*  Number nine, last person in this trust the process category. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2056.2799999999997s)]
*  Last team is Denver. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2060.12s)]
*  So, you know, there's been a lot of KCP stuff this first couple of weeks. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2063.08s)]
*  Brown's been good. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2067.48s)]
*  They're starting lineup is plus 14.9 net. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2068.3599999999997s)]
*  It's been their bench. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2071.48s)]
*  That's killing them. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2072.2799999999997s)]
*  The fact that, uh, the Westbrook was pretty good last night playing for Murray. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2073.0s)]
*  The bench hasn't been good enough. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2076.3199999999997s)]
*  And then, uh, Murray's just not the same guy. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2078.24s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2081.56s)]
*  We could talk about the bench. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2082.72s)]
*  We could talk about the league getting better, but Murray in the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2083.8s)]
*  2023 playoffs was 26 a game, 47% field goal, 40% three, 7.1 assists. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2086.4s)]
*  And this year he's 16 points a game, 4.4 assists, 37%, 30% from three. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2093.76s)]
*  And I test backs it up. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2099.6400000000003s)]
*  He just looks slower. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2101.04s)]
*  He has trouble getting his shot off. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2102.1200000000003s)]
*  And that's the guy to watch because if he's not back to 20, 23, Murray by April, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2104.0800000000004s)]
*  this team is, has no chance of winning the title, no matter how good Yoko just. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2109.48s)]
*  Next category, the sleeper. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2114.6800000000003s)]
*  So this was my hardest one in the power pole Golden state, who I think you could [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2116.92s)]
*  argue probably should be in the top five with how they've looked. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2123.8s)]
*  And I just, I don't want to shoot my wad on that one yet. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2128.36s)]
*  They got Boston, Cleveland. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2131.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2132.88s)]
*  See is their next three games. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2133.2400000000002s)]
*  Not great. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2135.28s)]
*  That's probably the, the, one of the all time gauntlets you're going to have in [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2136.04s)]
*  a regular season this decade, their second in defensive rating, which is [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2139.5600000000004s)]
*  something Steve Kerr was talking about a lot in the pre-season that he really [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2143.44s)]
*  liked how this team was defending. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2146.48s)]
*  They're playing Draymond with TJD a little bit. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2148.44s)]
*  Um, he played 12 guys, the first couple of games, which I don't know if that [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2151.32s)]
*  was a trade bait thing or what the plan was with that, as you know, I'm morally [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2156.84s)]
*  opposed to 12 men rotations, but I think he kind of wanted to see what he had. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2161.48s)]
*  Um, almost treated it like a college team. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2165.08s)]
*  The big thing for them is the buddy healed in the clay spot has been amazing. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2167.16s)]
*  He's 22 a game and 25.5 minutes making five threes a game for all time heat [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2171.4s)]
*  check seasons, like the Pantheon all time heat check season ever was John [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2178.36s)]
*  Drew in 1983, averaging 21.2 points a game in 27 minutes. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2183.44s)]
*  One of my favorites Freeman Williams in 1980, 18.6 points a game in 25.8 minutes, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2188.96s)]
*  but he's 22 and 25 and a half minutes, which might be as close as we've gotten [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2194.4s)]
*  to minutes and points for anyone playing under 27 a game, but they've unleashed him. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2199.92s)]
*  I think they really believe in him. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2204.8s)]
*  The shooting coach, uh, was his coach for the Bahamas and, uh, and they've just [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2206.12s)]
*  basically running all the clay stuff for him and it's going great. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2211.52s)]
*  Curry came back. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2214.28s)]
*  This team's better than I thought it was going to be. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2216.28s)]
*  I think I went over, it didn't do a lot or anything, but, um, but with their depth, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2217.92s)]
*  which you need in the regular season, I think this team, this is a high forties [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  team, I think, I think, uh, they have a lot of options and they have curry. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2225.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2229.04s)]
*  Next category definitely lurking. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2229.48s)]
*  So we have four teams in here. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2233.44s)]
*  Number seven is the Knicks. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2234.76s)]
*  This is weird. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2237.4s)]
*  Third offensive rating, 19th defensive rating, fifth overall. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2238.28s)]
*  Um, I don't know if you saw towns last week, but he eviscerated [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2242.76s)]
*  Bam out of bio and it was notable. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2250.1600000000003s)]
*  And I don't know if there was a history with those guys or what was happening, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2252.28s)]
*  but he absolutely destroyed them. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2254.76s)]
*  That plus the towns Brunson high screen, which I think is probably a top five [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2256.04s)]
*  unstoppable NBA player right now. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2262.6s)]
*  I don't really know what you do because you basically have to settle for town [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2264.44s)]
*  shooting from 25 feet wide open. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2268.0s)]
*  Cause you don't want to, you don't want to have Brunson [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2269.84s)]
*  basically attacking your big guy. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2272.12s)]
*  That plays great. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2274.52s)]
*  I love how towns is fit in their bench sucks. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2275.4s)]
*  There's seven, eight, nine, 10 right now is pain Sims, daddy and Huck [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2278.04s)]
*  Porty. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2282.16s)]
*  Uh, I know the next fans are like, well, we go to Robinson coming back. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2282.48s)]
*  Well, he played, he gets hurt every year. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2285.6s)]
*  The big thing for me is what was the point of the bridges trade for all the stuff [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2288.6s)]
*  they gave up, which I know they had to, but they gave up a fucking shitload for him. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2292.8s)]
*  And then when you watch the next play, he's basically Nikhil Alexander Walker on the [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2298.72s)]
*  side and for what they gave up for him, for how kind of little they gave up for him. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2303.84s)]
*  Kind of little, they use him. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2311.36s)]
*  It's, it's kind of shocking. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2312.56s)]
*  Like he's like a 15 points a game guy. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2313.92s)]
*  He just stands in the corner and crunch time. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2315.88s)]
*  I thought he would be way more involved with their offense. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2317.64s)]
*  And you know, you think like, if you honest is really going to be available over [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2321.0s)]
*  these next couple of weeks, months, they shot their water in this bridges package. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2324.64s)]
*  And, you know, they could have just done the town staying. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2331.88s)]
*  They could have kept everything else they had and kind of waited, but they, they [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2336.16s)]
*  went all in, I defended it last summer. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2340.28s)]
*  It made sense to me, but I asked them that they'd use bridges as more than just [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2342.76s)]
*  like this complimentary player. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2346.6400000000003s)]
*  So maybe it's got to sort itself out, but I'm just watching that because he just [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2347.96s)]
*  seems irrelevant sometimes for them. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2351.1600000000003s)]
*  And I don't, I don't like it. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2352.92s)]
*  So if you're going to give up that many picks for somebody, maybe, uh, maybe use [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2355.0400000000004s)]
*  them number six, Minnesota minus 0.4 net 18th defense Edwards has been the story [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2358.1600000000003s)]
*  because of all the threes he's taken, which by the way, if he's going to take [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2369.2s)]
*  12 threes a game and make 43% of them, knock yourself out. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2371.8399999999997s)]
*  I like how Randall's looked offensively for them. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2375.2799999999997s)]
*  He's almost 23 a game. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2377.24s)]
*  It's a little clumsy sometimes, but, um, you know, their defenses is obviously [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2379.0s)]
*  worse. One of the reasons it's worse is McDaniel's is basically unplayable. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2383.72s)]
*  He's sucks since the Dallas series. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2387.0s)]
*  Uh, McDaniel's D'Fenchenzo and Conley are basically at 30% [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2389.56s)]
*  shooting threes this year. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2393.48s)]
*  And that's, that's why I think they haven't, um, looked like maybe we thought [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2394.44s)]
*  they'd look yet, but I'm watching the McDaniel's thing cause they gave him an [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2400.12s)]
*  extension and Alexander Walker's just out playing them. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2402.84s)]
*  So is he a possible trade piece for them? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2406.76s)]
*  Can they get him going? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2410.04s)]
*  But this started in the playoffs last year and it hasn't gotten better. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2411.0s)]
*  And you think like one of the reasons their defense looked like one of the best [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2414.2400000000002s)]
*  defenses in the last 20 years, the first trends of the playoffs was because the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2417.7200000000003s)]
*  size of towns and go bear. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2422.6s)]
*  And then what McDaniel's and Edwards were able to do together. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2423.92s)]
*  And now McDaniel's is, uh, in a complete funk. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2426.4s)]
*  So watch out for that one. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2429.8399999999997s)]
*  Number five is Phoenix. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2431.6s)]
*  Somehow only a 16th offensive rating, which doesn't make sense when you're [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2434.3199999999997s)]
*  watching them because, uh, Katie and Booker and Beeler almost nine threes a [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2437.92s)]
*  game, 42% from three Katie's 27 a game, 55% shooting his crunch time stuff is [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2442.44s)]
*  as good as it's ever been. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2450.72s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2452.0s)]
*  I mean, he, he was in the 2007 draft. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2452.84s)]
*  I think everybody from that draft is gone, except for Horford and Conley, who [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2456.04s)]
*  were like role players at this point. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2459.76s)]
*  Katie's like beating double teams off the dribble and you know, he's [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2461.24s)]
*  going by whoever he wants. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2465.2s)]
*  He's been awesome. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2467.2s)]
*  I think he's. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2468.4s)]
*  He might be, it's him and Tatum, I think as the MVP through two weeks, just [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2470.88s)]
*  because of how much they've meant to their teams and how good they've been. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2474.72s)]
*  So it turns out having a point guard helps. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2478.36s)]
*  Who could have guessed? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2482.08s)]
*  We only had 77 years of basketball history there. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2482.8s)]
*  They now get fast breaks. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2485.56s)]
*  They now get Katie rolling off stuff. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2486.88s)]
*  Um, still some weird fourth quarter shit with them. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2488.92s)]
*  The Nurgle thing. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2491.96s)]
*  I still don't love against certain teams like Davis owns him, but I think [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2492.76s)]
*  Phoenix is where they want to be. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2495.8s)]
*  That was one of the teams we went big on before the season. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2496.84s)]
*  And, um, you know, they have one loss. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2500.56s)]
*  They're doing great. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2503.84s)]
*  So I almost put them in the, in the contender category, but I still [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2505.32s)]
*  don't think they know who their fifth guy is. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2509.16s)]
*  Like they were putting Ryan Dunn in there, but teams started leaving them open [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2511.36s)]
*  and they, they need to figure out. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2514.2000000000003s)]
*  Beal, Katie Booker, Nurgle, O'Neill. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2516.96s)]
*  I guess, I guess that's the five. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2521.1600000000003s)]
*  I kind of like it more sometimes when Nurgle isn't in there and they just [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2524.7200000000003s)]
*  go smaller and they have shooting all over the place, but, um, I'm feeling [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2529.08s)]
*  good about Phoenix, good to see coach button the sidelines again, the contenders. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2534.4s)]
*  I have Dallas for other people would have them a little further back because [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2538.68s)]
*  they haven't been playing that great. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2543.08s)]
*  They're 15th in offense, eighth in defense, PJ Washington, um, who. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2544.28s)]
*  Beat. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2550.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2550.68s)]
*  See last year, cause he made all those corner threes and they haven't gone in [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2550.96s)]
*  since the big thing for me is Luca who the, the MVP is sitting there for him. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2553.6s)]
*  Now, like Yannis is out. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2561.44s)]
*  Yokeage is going to be out cause Denver's not going to be good enough. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2564.96s)]
*  And beat's not going to play enough Tatum who has, I think he's averaging [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2567.68s)]
*  13 points a game in the first quarters, but the Celtics are blowing all these [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2573.44s)]
*  teams out, so he's not even playing enough minutes to like pad his stats, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2577.2799999999997s)]
*  but he's been great. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2580.9199999999996s)]
*  Katie's in there, but it just feels like Luca. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2582.3199999999997s)]
*  If, if he goes on a tear, he's going to be the easy MVP favorite. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2586.04s)]
*  He's only 28 a game, 40% field goal, 31% from three. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2590.0s)]
*  So I'm sure that's going to flip. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2594.44s)]
*  I'm sure he's going to have like 72 points against the bulls and all of a sudden [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2595.96s)]
*  all those numbers will go up, but, um, just feels first two weeks. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2599.36s)]
*  Hasn't. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2602.88s)]
*  Hasn't gotten it going. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2604.2400000000002s)]
*  It's fun to see Clay on this team. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2605.96s)]
*  I still feel like he's a little too involved because he's Clay Thompson, but [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2607.88s)]
*  you know, in crunch time, I kind of want the ball with Luca and Kyrie and just [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2612.08s)]
*  standing in the corner, Clay Thompson, but, uh, they're starting to line up [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2615.64s)]
*  suck too, so they got to figure that piece out. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2620.0s)]
*  Why is, why do they get better? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2622.76s)]
*  As soon as live that comes in, maybe he should just start and play more minutes. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2624.48s)]
*  Number three, Cleveland home run first two weeks for them. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2628.0s)]
*  They're eight now. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2631.52s)]
*  Uh, this was another team we went big on before the season. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2633.04s)]
*  Second in offense, fifth in defense. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2635.84s)]
*  They're plus 12.7 net. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2637.6s)]
*  They haven't had strews all year, but Laverte's been good for them. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2639.32s)]
*  Uh, they've gotten good shooting from Dean Wade, people like that. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2642.28s)]
*  But the big thing is Garland's back and we flagged this. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2645.04s)]
*  We talked about it extensively in the over under pod. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2648.44s)]
*  Garland broke his jaw last year. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2651.32s)]
*  It was a weird year in general. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2652.92s)]
*  They didn't know if Mitchell was staying or not this year. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2654.72s)]
*  Garland's 53%, 45% for three. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2657.68s)]
*  He absolutely obliterated Milwaukee last night. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2660.16s)]
*  Now, granted it's Milwaukee and it's named, but, um, he's back to getting [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2662.6s)]
*  wherever he wants to go and what I really like and what I think is really [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2666.12s)]
*  potentially special about this team. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2669.2400000000002s)]
*  Maybe Kenny Atkinson has a little bit to do with that. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2671.12s)]
*  Maybe the fact that Mitchell resigned with them, but, um, there's a real [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2673.04s)]
*  generosity with Garland and Mitchell now. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2678.68s)]
*  Like last night it was Garland's night. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2680.76s)]
*  Mitchell, Mitchell deferred. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2682.36s)]
*  He let them kind of run the show the last four or five minutes. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2684.52s)]
*  And if they needed Mitchell, he was there. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2687.52s)]
*  I don't know if that was as seamless last year. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2689.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think these guys have been together a couple of years now. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2691.7200000000003s)]
*  They had two huge crunch time wins over Milwaukee. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2693.84s)]
*  Mitchell made the big shot on Saturday. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2696.08s)]
*  Garland made all the big plays yesterday, but I liked the combo of them. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2698.04s)]
*  And I think the combo of Mobley and Allen, who were wondering, should [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2701.76s)]
*  they trade one of those guys? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2704.36s)]
*  Um, don't touch this team, this team. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2706.0s)]
*  This is unequivocally the third best team in the league right now. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2709.2000000000003s)]
*  So number two, I have, okay. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2713.08s)]
*  See, even though they are first in defensive rating at 93.2, which is 8.3 [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2714.76s)]
*  points lower than anyone else. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2722.44s)]
*  I don't even like, if we were going to say that's an NFL team, that would be [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2724.28s)]
*  like an NFL team giving up seven points a game for the first two months of the [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2727.7200000000003s)]
*  season, when they play Caruso and SGA together, though, all the advanced metrics, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2731.76s)]
*  they're basically the 96 bulls. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2737.52s)]
*  Shet is averaging almost five stocks a game. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2739.64s)]
*  He's over three blocks. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2743.64s)]
*  He's getting steals. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2744.72s)]
*  They haven't played a close crunch time game yet. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2746.16s)]
*  They're just dominating these games. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2748.08s)]
*  And by the way, they're not shooting that well from three point percentages. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2750.2400000000002s)]
*  Chet's under 30, SGA is under 30, Caruso is under 20, Wallace is under 33. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2754.12s)]
*  So there's a level for them to go with the three point shooting. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2759.52s)]
*  Defensively, they're unbelievable. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2762.92s)]
*  I just couldn't believe watching them on a, on Saturday night in person. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2764.6s)]
*  It just never ends. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2770.16s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2771.56s)]
*  Like, I know they have all these good defensive players and it makes sense that [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2773.3199999999997s)]
*  they're awesome on defense, but when you see it over the course of two and a half [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2776.56s)]
*  hours with your own eyes in person, it never lets up. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2779.68s)]
*  It's like watching a defense where the, the, in, in football, where the defense [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2783.44s)]
*  is just blitzing every single down. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2788.72s)]
*  And the offense is picking up for the first quarter and a half of the game. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2791.76s)]
*  And then by the third quarter, the quarterback, she's getting pounded. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2795.1600000000003s)]
*  That's what it felt like watching them. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2797.84s)]
*  They have so many options. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2799.84s)]
*  Um, everybody can switch onto a different guy. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2801.6s)]
*  There's nobody to attack. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2804.52s)]
*  It's funny watching these NBA teams. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2806.4s)]
*  We're like, who the fuck do we attack out of these guys? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2808.12s)]
*  Every, every person we want to get into a pick and roll can also [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2810.56s)]
*  guard the person that's dribbling. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2813.96s)]
*  So that plus how good Chet's looked this year. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2815.7200000000003s)]
*  Um, you know, this has a chance to be a really special regular season team. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2818.44s)]
*  We'll see about the playoffs, but, um, you know, this is a team that could win [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2822.68s)]
*  mid to high sixties, I think because night to night, the youth, the legs, the defense, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2827.6s)]
*  the Clippers played really well on Saturday night for about an hour. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2832.7200000000003s)]
*  And it didn't matter. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2836.04s)]
*  They were losing double digits in the fourth quarter. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2836.88s)]
*  Then the favorite is still has to be the Celtics. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2839.68s)]
*  They've only lost once. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2842.68s)]
*  They won the title last year at their fourth in defensive rating without [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2843.7200000000003s)]
*  poor Zingas 14.1 net rating. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2846.72s)]
*  Really good back to back wins against an annoying Charlotte team over the weekend [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2849.88s)]
*  that I thought were meaningful because the second game was a classic. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2853.2s)]
*  You forget to show up and you just kind of fucked the game up. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2857.6s)]
*  But Grant Williams had done a hard foul of Tatum. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2860.08s)]
*  That was a cheap shot at the end of the game. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2862.7599999999998s)]
*  Celtics were pissed about it and they came out and they laid [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2864.84s)]
*  this back down on Saturday. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2867.56s)]
*  This is something that Steve Kerr talked about with me once upon a time when I was [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2869.52s)]
*  doing my book about the year after you win the title, you have this different [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2875.12s)]
*  confidence and swagger to you because you've done it. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2879.92s)]
*  You've climbed the mountain. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2882.2s)]
*  You believe in the infrastructure of who you are. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2883.3599999999997s)]
*  And he's like, it's just, there's this invincibility that develops and it feels [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2886.2799999999997s)]
*  like the Celtics are tapping into that a little bit. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2890.72s)]
*  Now, Jaylen got a little banged up. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2893.64s)]
*  Uh, poor Zingas probably isn't coming back till December. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2895.48s)]
*  And then there's this Horford piece where he's playing 25 minutes a game. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2899.0s)]
*  He's fine. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2903.2799999999997s)]
*  He's eight and five. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2903.7999999999997s)]
*  They're just trying to basically pace him for the playoffs. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2904.8s)]
*  He hasn't shot a free throw yet this year in two weeks. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2908.0s)]
*  So last four years free throws, 95, 21, 30 last year, and then zero this year. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2911.04s)]
*  So they're really patching together the center position with him and Cornette and [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2917.88s)]
*  Kata. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2922.36s)]
*  Kata has been really big for them from a shot blocking standpoint. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2923.0800000000004s)]
*  And as a regular season team, I still think they're in their sixties if Tatum [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2926.6000000000004s)]
*  and White and Holliday are all playing and Jaylen plays enough games. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2930.52s)]
*  Tatum has been, uh, been on a mission and the three isn't even going in every game, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2934.88s)]
*  but he's, he's just peak of his powers at this point. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2940.88s)]
*  This is the best game to game quarter to quarter that he's ever been offensively. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2944.1200000000003s)]
*  He really knows how to attack, what he wants to do, how to be a point forward. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2949.88s)]
*  And this is still the best team in the league. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2954.36s)]
*  When poor Zingas comes back, um, this is a 18 game winning streak kind of a team. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2955.84s)]
*  And I think OKC is too. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2962.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think my big lesson from the first two weeks is that Boston and OKC, in my [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2964.16s)]
*  opinion, are levitating above everybody else. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2970.88s)]
*  Maybe Cleveland can kind of tap at their shoes a little bit, but it's Boston and [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2972.92s)]
*  OKC and that's why I picked before the season to make the finals. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2977.28s)]
*  I haven't seen one thing to make me think that's not going to be our finals. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9hIbXHmcs&t=2980.44s)]
