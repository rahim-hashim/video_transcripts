# Are the Pelicans 2025's Dumbest NBA Franchise? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM)
*  So I did like Derek Queen going to New Orleans in a trade at number 13. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=0.56s)]
*  And then we found out what the trade was. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=5.9s)]
*  This was when I lost my mind. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=9.8s)]
*  I think I blacked out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=11.4s)]
*  I'm so glad the NBA can still give us these. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=12.8s)]
*  New Orleans trades up 10 spots so they can take Derek Queen and they give up [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=15.1s)]
*  their unprotected 2026 first round pick swap that they have with Milwaukee, where [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  they have the favorable, whatever the better pick is they keep. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=24.52s)]
*  They send that to Atlanta who had to be deliriously happy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=27.68s)]
*  Like we only have to move down 10 spots and we get an unprotected. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  This was one of the five dumbest trades of this decade. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=36.28s)]
*  I, I was speechless. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=40.36s)]
*  I just can't believe it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=43.32s)]
*  And who is it? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=44.52s)]
*  It's our guy, Joe Dumars, who was so bad in the first half of the 2010s. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=45.58s)]
*  He, I got so much column mileage from him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=51.0s)]
*  He finally got bounced from the pistons, never got another job. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  And then moved into the NBA and everybody in the NBA loved him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=56.8s)]
*  And he's a great guy by all accounts and enough time passed that everybody [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  forgot how bad of a GM he was down in it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  And now he just traded away their unprotected 2026 pick house. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=66.8s)]
*  They're in the West. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  What the fuck does he think's going to happen next year? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=73.08s)]
*  He, he thinks they're going to be a five seed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  What is he doing? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=77.52s)]
*  The hilarious thing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  And this is what, what, um, we get to relish coming going forward is there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=79.62s)]
*  He, they're doing some kind of their version of 3d chess here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  Cause I think Zion is moving on. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=90.0s)]
*  I think the point of Zion leaving CAA, going over to build Duffy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=91.96s)]
*  There's a trade demand coming. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=97.52s)]
*  Dara queen is fits a specific needs, plays a specific role for them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=99.72s)]
*  Um, and they were just like, this is, this is our plan. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=104.63999999999999s)]
*  We have a plan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  We're going to acquire him and we can't, you know, let, let the possibility, uh, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  they go that, that, um, we don't get him for, for this, for this role. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=113.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=118.84s)]
*  So you're saying they're trading their best player, which will inevitably make [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=119.08s)]
*  next year's team worse and they're not going to have a pick after they trade [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  that player that makes sense to you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=126.44s)]
*  And a better draft from what we understand. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=128.28s)]
*  I would anticipate that any kind of Zion trade would include picks. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, is that reasonable? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=135.76s)]
*  So your only defense of that trade is the hypothetical that Zion might get [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=137.0s)]
*  traded, which by the way, would also then make them worse and they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=141.52s)]
*  wouldn't have their pick. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  I said it's their version of 3d chess. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=147.08s)]
*  It's just, it's just the Dumars world. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=148.52s)]
*  It's this is one of those that Adam silver, like you could have talked me into [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=150.36s)]
*  him vetoing, like they vetoed the Chris Paul trade. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=154.68s)]
*  That's how bad that trade was. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=157.08s)]
*  Kyle, would Atlanta have done that trade? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  If it was a top four protected pick? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to say yes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=163.4s)]
*  Top four protected. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=166.88s)]
*  Atlanta is like, we're still doing it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Top seven protected. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=169.44s)]
*  I think they do that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=170.8s)]
*  Probably, probably. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  Uh, I can't even imagine they're showing all these war rooms. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=173.56s)]
*  They should have shown the Hawks war room as guys are taking their shirts off [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  doing this and fucking popping champagne on each other. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  It was, it was probably like the city on the bus. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=185.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=188.96s)]
*  It was like the mushroom scene. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=189.28s)]
*  And this is the end where they're just like, go nuts. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=190.52s)]
*  And, um, I can't even imagine how deliriously happy they were. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=192.8s)]
*  And I really like where Atlanta was sitting before tonight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  And now they have this New Orleans pick. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=199.76s)]
*  They have a $25 million trade exception. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=201.72s)]
*  They added poor Zingas. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=204.0s)]
*  Jaylen Johnson's coming back. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  They got Dyson Daniels and Trey Young and Risa Shea and a Kangu. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=206.92s)]
*  House. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=210.92s)]
*  It's, it's time to look at the conference odds. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=212.48s)]
*  Don't think that I haven't already, but please. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=216.48s)]
*  You already did. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  You cheated on me. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=219.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  What the hell, House? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  Um, they're not in the top six. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=223.0s)]
*  33 to one to win the East. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=228.44s)]
*  That's a ticket that's in my portfolio. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=229.64s)]
*  Later. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=232.64s)]
*  Bandel sports book. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=234.2s)]
*  Three to one. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=234.88s)]
*  What did they get? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=236.92s)]
*  Demarco Rosen with that trade exception. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=237.44s)]
*  All they have to do is make it to the Eastern conference. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=239.32s)]
*  But they don't have to win for that ticket to have value. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=241.76s)]
*  You have an amazing head with that 33 to one sitting in your pocket. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=244.11999999999998s)]
*  That team that's the, I still can't imagine one stop that they make in like, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  Dyson Daniels is incredible. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=255.27999999999997s)]
*  I can't name one other player. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=257.0s)]
*  I mean, John Johnson's plays both ways for sure as well, but, um, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=258.68s)]
*  no Johnson and Daniels as their two defenders. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=263.36s)]
*  And then they'll, they'll be able to do some other stuff. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=265.72s)]
*  We were texting a lot about Derek Queen during the season, because he brings, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  he brings some things to the table that I love. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  There's some defensive stuff with him that is about as bad as it gets. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=275.12s)]
*  And it's going to be, he's going to be one of those guys where I, I, I do [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  think it's a, he's a ceiling basement guy, but there's some really good offensive [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=283.12s)]
*  stuff. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=287.48s)]
*  The problem is some of the ways you would use them on offense are very [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=287.76s)]
*  similar to how like you would use, say a Zion Williamson, who's also, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=291.24s)]
*  just hypothetically, no idea how those two guys would play together. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  Makes no sense at all. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=300.4s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=301.88s)]
*  They, they are, they have mirroring issues for sure, but he's, he's, he, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  you're right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=308.36s)]
*  I mean, he's got a lot of things that you like. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=308.76s)]
*  I mean, the connectivity of his passing, I was saying on our, on the draft show [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=310.2s)]
*  that in that 18 feet to the rim area, he, he roasts other bigs with his foot [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  speed, with his balance, he can contort. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=321.72s)]
*  He just does some things that are odd for a player of his body type. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  He's not super explosive, but you mentioned the defensive stuff. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of that's controllable for him. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=330.6s)]
*  I mean, if you're banking on him ever being, if you're banking on him being [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  your room protector, then you should, you should just have to take a breathalyzer [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  before you even are qualified to, to, to run a team because that was so obvious. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=340.68s)]
*  He doesn't have the size to be a rim protector. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=345.88s)]
*  He's more of a help defender. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=348.0s)]
*  And the big thing for him too, is he has great hands. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=349.4s)]
*  He does have mobile hips, even though he's not super fast. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=351.88s)]
*  Um, and he's a great defensive rebounder. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=354.84s)]
*  Uh, it's, it's more of a play to play. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=357.24s)]
*  Is he going to mature to the point where he starts taking that personally? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=360.12s)]
*  Because people have just said this about him relentlessly. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=364.08s)]
*  And I know this stuff's gotten back to him about, uh, on the defensive glass [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=366.28s)]
*  or just on the glass period. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=369.8s)]
*  It's like, oh, where's my man? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=371.0s)]
*  Oh, he just ran by me. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=372.12s)]
*  Cause I didn't touch him and he got an easy basket that happened over and over [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=373.32s)]
*  again, and just consistency of effort because, um, he can be, I think at [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=376.48s)]
*  least a neutral defender, it's just, it's going to be up to him whether or not [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=381.8s)]
*  he takes that personally and cuts out the taking plays off and stuff like that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=384.88s)]

*  He triggers a lot of my boxes because I like the creativity in [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=418.84s)]
*  an offense is really special. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't like the work ethic part and the taking plays off and the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  defensive liability part. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=427.52s)]
*  Sam Bissini said something on Rosso's pod about how he's just been playing [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  against men for the last couple of years as a big guy and just seasoned with, and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=434.4s)]
*  that he thought he was actually a pretty good bet to be able to play faster. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  Then you think, um, I, to me, it's amazing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=445.24s)]
*  The Hawks fleece them two summers in a row, two different front offices. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  The Dejante Murray trade was, was a fleecing. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=452.88s)]
*  And then this happens that is house. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=457.64s)]
*  They might have the championship belt now, a biggest mess of a team. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=464.2s)]
*  I think this is it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=470.52s)]
*  I think giving away next year's first round pick and making it unprotected. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=471.52s)]
*  I think they grabbed the belt. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=475.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=476.76s)]
*  I think Sacramento was like, we just got it back. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=477.08s)]
*  What, what do you mean? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=480.68s)]
*  We just, and they just took it back. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=483.2s)]
*  Like without blinking. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=487.52s)]
*  I, I, it's very, not to mention they're putting Jeremiah fears Jordan pool [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=489.0s)]
*  together. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=494.2s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=494.64s)]
*  I thought that the wizards traded Jeremiah pool away so that beers would fit [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=495.32s)]
*  better. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=499.68s)]
*  And then when they picked beers, I was like, Oh, I'm way off with my logic, but [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  this guy, I thought that's what they were doing house. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=504.08s)]
*  And Trey Murphy has got to be like, why am I here? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=506.52s)]
*  What is this team? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  This, this is the most confounding team. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=512.96s)]
*  I, I, I was trying to come up with, I mean, even Charlotte feels like it has a [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=515.2s)]
*  point. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  It feels like it has a direction. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=520.24s)]
*  Phoenix is like in this conversation, got to keep Phoenix. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=522.08s)]
*  You know, there, there's still, I guess, Phoenix does have Phoenix. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=525.72s)]
*  So I thought Sacramento took it back from Phoenix, but you're right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  Phoenix still has it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  So I made a good pick tonight when we get to it, when they did sac, maybe [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=534.84s)]
*  Sacramento is right in the ship a little bit, but I mean, Sacramento turning. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=539.08s)]
*  Fox and Halliburton into Zach Levine. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=544.36s)]
*  That's like an all timer. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=547.6s)]
*  Um, not to mention the Sabonis extension on that stuff, but yeah, you're right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=549.12s)]
*  I think so Phoenix probably had it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  And then New Orleans just took it and New Orleans has had this belt. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=556.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're, they're basically like the Russell Celtics with this belt. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=560.24s)]
*  They've had it nine different times over the course of, uh, since the mid seventies. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=563.08s)]
*  You have to remember how close the Pelicans were those to turning the corner. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=567.44s)]
*  They've been close a couple of times for five seconds. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=571.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  But, but I mean, they had a playing game against Lebron and then that, and then [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=574.36s)]
*  the moment was over, they were on a pace for over 50 wins just a year ago. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=577.2800000000001s)]
*  They got 40 first round picks for Anthony Davis. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  I get it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=584.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying they were, they won the lottery. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=585.4000000000001s)]
*  The problem I have with, uh, with Derek, with, with, with my, with my guy, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=588.36s)]
*  Queen, the DMV thing. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=593.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=595.2s)]
*  It's just, it's, it's this, um, maturity is, is still under development and you [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=596.04s)]
*  can eyeball, you can use your own eyeballs and look at his body type and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=606.68s)]
*  reach a conclusion that maybe he hasn't maximized all that's available to him to [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=613.96s)]
*  turn himself into the kind of beast that he might be in terms of physical [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=620.88s)]
*  specimen. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=626.24s)]
*  It would be one thing if he was going to New Orleans where this is the point. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=627.76s)]
*  There's so much healthy food there and clean living. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=632.48s)]
*  We just, they just lived through a guy who had a maturity issue and maybe an [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=635.08s)]
*  issue where he didn't maximize. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=640.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=642.52s)]
*  So, and Derek is not 18 years old. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=643.04s)]
*  This is like, it would be one thing to say, yeah, he's pudgy. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=646.36s)]
*  He's 18 or he's 19 or whatever. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=648.6s)]
*  He's pushing up. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=650.72s)]
*  He's closer to 21 than he is to 18. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  So you don't think he's on the VersaClimber at five in the morning, like LeBron? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=654.9200000000001s)]
*  Here's the thing he can do that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=659.32s)]
*  It's there. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=661.28s)]
*  They have VersaClimbers. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=662.16s)]
*  They can get one down to New Orleans and he could become the beast that we're [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=664.12s)]
*  talking about. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=667.28s)]
*  He could make that commitment. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=668.28s)]
*  You know, he can get that challenge on the defensive end and become that guy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=669.6s)]
*  I hope he does. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=673.44s)]
*  He was, uh, it was great to have Marilyn, uh, viable for, for, uh, for a basketball [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=674.72s)]
*  season, um, here most recently. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=680.08s)]
*  And it makes some noise in the tournament. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=682.64s)]
*  Um, I want the kid to succeed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=684.5200000000001s)]
*  It feels like it's up to the kid. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=687.32s)]
*  Joe Dumars was so bad in Detroit that I once wrote in a column that I wanted to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=690.32s)]
*  sell Joe Dumars cap space cologne. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=695.96s)]
*  You only have to spray it once and then you can't get away from the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=698.48s)]
*  smell for three to five years. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=701.2s)]
*  Remember when he was handing out all those terrible contracts? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=703.24s)]
*  Everyone forgets how bad Joe Dumars was. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=706.24s)]
*  11 years, right? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=708.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=709.84s)]
*  Fortunately he has, he has a Sean marks and some others. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  I feel like we're, we're almost like atrocious GM summit territory. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, you're going to fire it back up. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=718.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  We, we're, we almost have enough teams again. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  House is giddy. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=725.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=726.96s)]
*  I'm trying to think of all the teams. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=727.48s)]
*  We got Vivek. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=728.88s)]
*  We got, we got Ishbia. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=729.96s)]
*  We have New Orleans. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=731.72s)]
*  You got a lot of character voices to ride to as well. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=733.12s)]
*  I think this is prime. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=735.64s)]
*  I feel like the Chicago could be in the running. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=736.96s)]
*  Chicago Jerry Reinsdorf never paid the luxury tax. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=739.84s)]
*  Um, I will say, I will say on Queen one thing he, one apologetic thing I [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  would say is that he, considering where he was like a couple of years ago, he [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=749.32s)]
*  has made progress, uh, he has worked on his body. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=753.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=755.8000000000001s)]
*  So I, I, I hope he continues that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=756.0s)]
*  And keeps the value at 13. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=758.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=760.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=760.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJUd2FImkQM&t=761.24s)]
