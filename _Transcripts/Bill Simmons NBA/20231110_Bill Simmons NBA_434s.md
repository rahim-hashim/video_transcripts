# Are the Timberwolves Bona Fide Title Contenders? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrJm3g8OvM4)
*  Okay.
*  So I previewed this season with a column that had 20 increasingly bold predictions.
*  And one of them was Minnesota finishing with a top three record in the Western
*  conference.
*  They look really good right now.
*  Number four in net rating five and two.
*  Um, I still think that it's possible they finished top three in the Western
*  conference, but I wanted to take this one step further and ask you guys if we
*  should consider them a bonafide title contender right now.
*  I'm there.
*  Woo.
*  I did this on Tuesday in the power pole.
*  I had them fifth and I think it's, I put it in pen, not pencil.
*  Like I I'm there with them from a size defense standpoint and whatever is going
*  to happen with Edwards over the last six, seven months.
*  I mean, there's contenders and then there's like, are these guys a finals
*  favorite?
*  And I just feel like Denver is levitating above everybody else.
*  The Celtics, as soon as they fixed two bench spots are probably the two, but I
*  think Minnesota is right there underneath, right with gold.
*  I had them with Golden State and Philly.
*  Those were the five and then we'll see who else joins.
*  But to me, Minnesota is, I think they're there.
*  What do you think Howard?
*  Well, you know, look, it's positive sign that, um, the chemistry seems sound ish.
*  It's early, uh, positive that, that go bears now talking about like, yeah, this
*  is the best I've felt it forever.
*  Physically, um, back concerns and whatever that we're, I guess, hampering
*  him last year, um, that matters because it felt like go bear was maybe starting
*  to trend even before he left Utah, even before the trade, it seemed like he was
*  maybe trending downward as a, that, that Supreme, you know, the walking top 10
*  defense is what we refer to him as, right?
*  You plug him into any team there, there are top 10 defense just by go bear being
*  there, and it seemed like maybe that was over based on, on age, mileage, wear and
*  tear.
*  But if, if he can do that again in this context and they can have it figured out
*  between him and cat Naz read, plug and play with, with those guys,
*  don't forget about the best player in the league.
*  That's read best player in the league.
*  Not as read, um, right.
*  Just, just a percentage point ahead of the per 100 King.
*  That's read, um, he threw it.
*  Was it the last night?
*  The past?
*  He threw it.
*  He had this incredible passing that day too.
*  I was like, he was like, it was in transition dribbling up the court.
*  And then like, he's like, yeah, it was, yeah, it was the lob to, uh,
*  it's Anthony Edwards, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Um, they do, they have a really interesting mix of high end talent and depth, which is
*  the really, really tough thing to do right now, because eventually your high end talent
*  makes too much money for you to have any depth whatsoever, which again, this is the
*  argument against dynasties eventually, like even like, whether it's the nuggets,
*  whether it's like way too early to talk about the thunder, but the thunder of all
*  this cool young talent, eventually you have to pay guys when you have to start paying
*  guys, you have to start losing guys.
*  Um, anyway, Timberwolves contender right now, I, I'm going to pump the brakes.
*  I'm just going to say like, like we have, there were too many warning signs with this
*  team even before cat went down and cat's entire career is one big flashing warning sign.
*  Uh, so I, I, I feel like the bar for them to prove to us that they are legitimate.
*  Should be higher based on their own track record.
*  And, and, and frankly, cat's track record as their centerpiece for so many years.
*  And I know aunt Edwards is essentially the centerpiece now, but cat looms large in this
*  picture and you can't just wave him away.
*  Um, and you can't wave his, his seven, eight years away.
*  I would say just the recipe here is best defense in the NBA, which they are.
*  And I think is totally sustainable throughout this season because of how go bear has played
*  is averaging over 13 rebounds a game.
*  The field goal percentage at the rim when he's the closest defender is just like
*  microscopic.
*  He's he looks vintage.
*  It looks like he was when he was winning defensive player of the year awards, um,
*  him, and then just having a guard who looks like, I don't know if this is hyperbolic,
*  but he looks like young Dwayne Wade with a three point shot right now.
*  That's what Anthony Edwards is.
*  He's 28 and five, uh, 50, 40, 85 shooting splits.
*  I think most of that is pretty like sustainable for throughout a regular season for him.
*  And it's more than the numbers though.
*  It's just how he's processing defenses.
*  The game is very, it's much slower this year.
*  You can already tell than it was for him in his first few seasons where, you know,
*  I know his long to shot rate is really high right now through a few games, but like
*  when he does turn those shots down and he's patient, um, uh, and he's like waiting for
*  cutters along the baseline or different, um, opportunities to open up and a player,
*  sometimes he gives it up and moves and gets it back and attacks from a different angle.
*  That's the type of stuff that like super duper stars do.
*  And the fact that he's already doing it at this young age, this early in the season,
*  showing real comfort with Jaden McDaniels, with Mike Conley, with go Barry through a
*  lob to go bear the other night when last season he basically never even looked at
*  go bear when he was rolling down the paint.
*  So I just think like these pieces make so much sense.
*  They have so much depth.
*  They have space.
*  They have so much size and they match up really well with the best team.
*  And I mean, they beat, they spanked the Denver nuggets, um, a little while ago.
*  And they beat the Celtics.
*  Yeah.
*  And they beat the, the, the Edwards piece, the decision-making still makes me a
*  little nervous because they should have lost the Celtic game and regulation.
*  Missoula calls a timeout and actually sets up a play.
*  Maybe the game goes differently, but he heats up in a way that reminds me of
*  like the best parts of all time.
*  Like, I don't, I feel totally comfortable saying that he takes over games for three,
*  four minutes in ways that remind me of the best parts I've ever seen.
*  And Howard, we're the two old guys.
*  Like, I don't think that's nuts to say when, when Edwards is feeling it on both
*  ends for three straight minutes, it's way, way up there.
*  It's at a different level on that.
*  To me, that's why they're a real contender because they have somebody who can
*  elevate like that shake and do it, but he can't do it on the other end, you know?
*  And she's a good defensive player, but not Edwards was like, he, he imprinted
*  himself on that overtime in a way that I thought was pretty unique.
*  So you throw that with the other stuff.
*  I'm with you on Howard on towns though.
*  I, I, you know, he's the fart in the church of this team right now.
*  I would say that, uh, one of the reasons why people are skeptical about this team
*  is obviously their offense when towns is on the court with go bear so far, 118.9
*  offensive rating, extremely good.
*  The Denver nuggets, this seed are 118.4, just for some comparison and some context.
*  And they're doing things on defense that they just never have done for like half a
*  decade, like they're not fouling, they're grabbing defensive rebounds.
*  They're getting back in transition.
*  So when you can protect the rim and you can defend the two best perimeter guys
*  and the other team, that's like 97% of the battle.
