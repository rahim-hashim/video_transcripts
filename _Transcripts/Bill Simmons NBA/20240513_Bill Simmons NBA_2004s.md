# Nuggets Tie It Up 2-2. Did Jokic and Murray Figure Out the Wolves? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cdlN77Ifq8)
*  There's certain nights when it's just great to do what we do.
*  When it's like, let's watch that game.
*  We'll see what happens.
*  We'll do a podcast after.
*  I didn't know what was going to happen tonight.
*  The line was Minnesota by three.
*  It moved to Minnesota by four.
*  You could have told me they were going to win by 20 and put a defensive performance
*  of the ages.
*  You could have told me they weren't going to be ready yet.
*  What I wasn't expecting is Denver playing as great of an offensive game
*  against good defense as I've seen in a while.
*  I mean, they shot 19 for 29 from three, 32 for 50 from two.
*  And these were high degree of difficulty shots for so this is Jamal Murray at the
*  top of the third quarter, just making four straight long jumpers on good defense with
*  a hand in his face and Yocage maneuvering down the stretch.
*  Gordon's 11 for 12.
*  They were just awesome.
*  So I'll start here.
*  Feels a little Mahomes chiefs, December, 2023 ish, right?
*  They're down on two.
*  We're like, it's over, including me.
*  It's done.
*  You thought it was over.
*  I did.
*  I thought I thought Minnesota was going to sweep them mainly because I didn't think
*  Murray had what he did the last two games in him.
*  He looked like he was physically compromised to me and then all the other stuff.
*  It was like, hey, man, they had a great run.
*  Hard to go back to back.
*  It's Minnesota's time.
*  And in a weekend, it shifts.
*  I picked Minnesota.
*  I felt like it was a coin toss.
*  And after game two's defensive display, which was like, I think it's the best 24
*  minutes I've seen from a team defensively in a long time.
*  And if it's far as like our pods with right after, you know, you're at Denver
*  defending champs, those first 24 minutes, I just think we're horrifying for Denver.
*  But I think once it turned into the sweep talk, like, I don't ever think there's
*  going to be sweeps when the teams are bad because it's human nature to let down a
*  little bit.
*  And then in this case, you have Denver where you think, okay, look, it's hard to
*  win a title.
*  We can talk about an easier path for them with the heat in the finals, the Lakers
*  in the Western Conference finals.
*  Like, yeah, traditionally, if you look back at it, like, it's not the toughest
*  course, but they've gone through the years of disappointment.
*  They've gotten their playoff scars.
*  And I just, the one like tenant of the playoffs for me every single year is you
*  can never be as desperate as the team that is down 0-2.
*  You just can't be.
*  And if they're any good, which we've learned again, that Denver is really good,
*  that they're going to come out and fight.
*  I thought they went a lot quicker in game three because like the biggest problem
*  that I saw in game two is when you wait and Denver likes to be methodical, you
*  know, they'll run their offense, they'll wait, they'll kind of see what's going on.
*  It's like, look, if you wait, they are on you.
*  And I thought they were more aggressive.
*  And then tonight's just an absurd display.
*  As you pointed it out at 76, 60 Denver shooting splits were 67 and 53%.
*  It's nuts.
*  Well, you think like game three, it was tight for the first quarter, right?
*  And they, they called that game differently and they didn't let a lot of the physical
*  stuff go.
*  Minnesota missed some layups.
*  They missed some easy shots.
*  Denver all of a sudden is up 12.
*  And then they just started to separate and it was like, oh, they got their mojo back.
*  But I'll be interested to see if they call this differently and Minnesota can do
*  what they did in game two, can Denver handle it?
*  What I don't understand.
*  And I was really watching carefully tonight, trying to figure it out.
*  How did Yocage and Murray figure out the pace on offense?
*  Something they did say, like part of it was, I think they put, they put their
*  shooters, like if you look like Gordon's basically under the basket and two guys in
*  the corner or there were two guys, you know, on one side, but they were trying to give
*  those guys as much space as possible.
*  But something slowed down for them that in the first two games, it was just too
*  frantic and too frenetic.
*  And they figured out a way to just.
*  Just comment to the pace that they wanted to get to.
*  And I didn't really fully understand how they did it.
*  And they made some great shots.
*  I mean, Gordon, Gordon made five shots.
*  He makes once a month.
*  Right.
*  That Murray shot that he hit a McDaniel where McDaniel was just all over him.
*  It reminded me of game two defense.
*  I was like, oh, here we go.
*  Like, is this going to be, they're going to get a stop here in some sort of
*  momentum.
*  And then Murray just finds a way to finish it off to his right side.
*  I like talking about game three and four here.
*  If you're cool with it, just because I think the officiating part of it, I went
*  back and watched the first seven fouls once it got to thirty six, twenty three.
*  You talk about game.
*  You talk about game three, game three.
*  I thought those first seven fouls that were called the only one that was suspect
*  was the first one where Yokochi initiates the contact into Katz Chin.
*  And he knew kind of what he was doing.
*  And the officials are like, all right, it's on the floor, which it always makes
*  me feel like the officials are like, we don't even love that we're calling this,
*  but we have to call something on display the rest of the time.
*  They're just hacking them.
*  I thought.
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  But they were hacking them in game two and I think they were getting away with it.
*  I think that was part of the problem because it was prison ball in game two.
*  And I think they thought it was going to carry over and it just didn't.
*  It felt like game two.
*  Denver was like, wait, are you guys seriously going to play like this?
*  We're not ready.
*  Okay.
*  We're not ready.
*  And the combination of really good players getting incredibly frustrated.
*  And that's what happens to like great competitors is they're usually going to just
*  start losing their minds because they're going, I can't believe we feel this helpless.
*  Yeah. Minnesota was doing the Hagler-Herns pace in game two.
*  And Denver was like, wait, what?
*  So then when I looked at it, it gained three.
*  So you're right.
*  Like I'm going, I'm sampling in some game two stuff here as well.
*  But when I think about game three, first of all, Denver didn't turn the ball over
*  until deep into the second quarter.
*  I thought Minnesota's offense stunk.
*  They missed some so many bunnies and lamps.
*  I think there's some real truth in that this Timberwolves team is young and was really
*  feeling themselves on a couple of days off here and about, you know,
*  cause I had moments in game two where I was like, is this the finals?
*  Like, I feel like this series is the finals.
*  You know, I agree with you.
*  I said that to my family because my whole family, my, my wife, my son and daughter,
*  mother's day, nothing better a mother's day than watching an NBA playoff game.
*  I know my wife was fired up and at some point my daughter said, who are you rooting for?
*  And I was like, I think I'm rooting for Minnesota because Denver's probably slightly,
*  but I think both of these teams are probably favored against the Celtics.
*  They're just playing at a level of efficiency.
*  Minnesota defensively and Denver offensively that I'm not positive.
*  The Celtics can match over the course of two weeks without poor Zingas.
*  It's a funny question.
*  I'd be okay.
*  It is funny though, because when you think about who you root for and a lot of it's just you and
*  I like with our investment in our takes, it's, it's, I want, want to be able to retire on this
*  take or I don't want to be dreadfully wrong, even though it's going to happen after game two,
*  where it turned into like, I was like, wait, we can't, we can't,
*  Yokelch lose in the series first before everybody started to pile on about how undeserving is of
*  all these things.
*  I couldn't believe the texts I was getting from people who are smart.
*  I'm not going to name them, but they were like, oh, your guy, Yokelch.
*  I'm like, what?
*  Did you see what Minnesota did?
*  Like who was stopping them in that game?
*  In a weird way, I felt like after game two and then they won game three, I was happy for Denver.
*  I was just happy for Yokelch because I went, well, he can't possibly go out this way.
*  And then again, tonight's an even more dominant reminder because he just wanted to shoot.
*  I mean, took 26 shots tonight and there's only been one game in two months going back into the
*  regular season where he's taken more than 26 shots in a game.
*  And I think he, he has like a plan.
*  Like I think Kat does a good job of holding up with him physically than a strength thing.
*  And then with the go bear part of it floating, like you, which may be more likely to want to
*  play make a little bit like that pass that he had to Gordon.
*  And that was actually Ant's fault.
*  He just lost Gordon behind him as Kat and, and Rue York's on him.
*  The one where he leaned to his left.
*  That little sneaky, oh my, that sneaky pass around three guys.
*  That was nuts.
*  Right.
*  Jamal's on the call going to Reggie Miller's like, did you even see that pass?
*  Like they probably saw it.
*  Yeah.
*  After he made the basket, I saw it, but you can see with Yokech like there's a tier of, of what
*  he'll do depending on who's in now.
*  And I think that's what he's figured out going back into three and four.
*  If he has just Rudy, he's going right at him every time he can't wait.
*  If he goes at Nas, even more so with the cat Rudy thing, he's probably a little bit more reserved
*  because he's trying to figure out how Rudy's going to come to him.
*  Cause I think Kat, at least in we'll get to Kat, I think he's going to be a little bit more
*  reserved, at least in we'll get to Kat, cause it wasn't very good tonight.
*  I think Kat, the very least like holds up somewhat physically knowing that there's help there.
*  But you can see depending on what Minnesota is doing and matching him with personnel,
*  he seems to change.
*  And I think at this point, like the scary part for Minnesota is I think he's figured out all of
*  their options already.
*  Let's stay on this.
*  Cause I like where you're going with it.
*  Cause it's not to bring my homes back into this, but my homes will have those playoff games.
*  It's like, I need to use my legs today.
*  I'm going to have, I'm probably gonna have to run nine times and Yocage in game three.
*  I thought he realized, you know, everybody's got to play.
*  We need collectively to be awesome.
*  This is not a game for me to take 35 shots or whatever.
*  Today was the game where, especially the way Edwards came out, Edwards came out, like he was
*  2001 Kobe and Yocage played differently.
*  I mean, he had, I think 16 in the fourth quarter, but he just, he'll put the weight on himself
*  when he knows that they need it.
*  But they also, I mean, when you think like Gordon's 11 for 12, Murray makes a 55 footer
*  and like five other crazy shots and then Yocage is shooting the way he shot.
*  And then they get the random couple holiday threes.
*  You're not going to beat them.
*  Like if I'm Minnesota, if I'm the coach in the locker room after, and I probably ask like,
*  Carl, can you, can you stay after everybody leaves for just two minutes?
*  Just want to talk to you.
*  Just, we'll stay between us.
*  We'll go in the equipment room.
*  If I'm Minnesota, I don't feel terrible about that game.
*  So like, just look at the, look at some of the stuff we're doing.
*  McDaniels was picking up dudes 90 feet and putting the miles on Murray and doing all
*  the stuff you have to do.
*  But Murray was just different physically than it was five days ago.
*  The guy in game one and game two was not remotely resembling the guy from game three
*  and game four, I thought.
*  And when he plays like that, they're at a different level.
*  But I mean, there's other stuff here.
*  Like nobody showed up with Ant tonight offensively.
*  Nas Nas I think was five or six off the bench, but towns was just so abhorrent in this game
*  and just was playing that.
*  It was another town's greatest hits bad game.
*  I think at one point he had 17 shots for 13 points.
*  He did his rec was it terrible foul 55 feet from the basket.
*  And then go bear.
*  Here's another thing I got for you, Rossello.
*  Like they played their best game in game to go bear to him.
*  We got to talk about it.
*  I mean, we, it has to be discussed.
*  Let's do the cat part first.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  Not I wouldn't call him one of our favorites.
*  I can't stand him.
*  He started one of 10.
*  He heated up.
*  Got to 416 at one point.
*  He had the half court foul that is completely pointless for a guy that's always a foul.
*  Take the charge at main court.
*  How many times have they called the charge at mid court this season?
*  Like four.
*  He did try to take the other charge there, which is fine, but he complained.
*  And look, this is turning into a complaint first league.
*  But, you know, if you're really, really good, even if I'll be annoyed over two hours, that's okay.
*  Cat's not good enough to complain as much as he does.
*  And so then he had later in the second half, he had that offensive foul where he just three point,
*  my reporter junior, and he celebrated the make thinking.
*  After shoved them backwards into the basket support and fist bump.
*  And he's got his hand up in the air as everybody's walking to the other end of the court.
*  He was the last person in the entire arena to know that the foul was on him.
*  He also had another play where it looked like Minnesota wanted to try to defend their pressure
*  as much as they could.
*  And the problem is, is like, you might win a possession with that, catching them off guard.
*  But against a team like Denver, you're just opening up all this space behind it.
*  And they've been torched on that.
*  And he had a play where it was like, you couldn't foul there, like you can't foul.
*  And he actually like hit Jokic in the back.
*  I think the rest are just like, we don't even want to do it.
*  And it's crazy to think he's the best three point shooting player.
*  I don't know what the number is after because I didn't look it up after the game sorted tonight.
*  But coming in, he's the best three point shooter in the playoffs.
*  And I don't care.
*  I don't care.
*  You know, in theory, he's what you need for Ant, somebody who can play,
*  who can match another big body, which I think he's actually done okay with.
*  But when he has to think about defensive decisions, then it becomes a mess.
*  He had plays in game three, Bill, where there'd be like a baseline drive
*  and he'd be in the paint and he would like run to close out on Christian
*  Barr on the opposite side of the Christian Brown.
*  Excuse me, on the opposite side of the ball.
*  You're like of all the places you should prioritize, that's not where it should happen.
*  I know he's going to have a big night where he's going to hit a bunch of threes or whatever.
*  I just don't care.
*  I don't care.
*  I don't trust him.
*  And you would think he was so good in game one and game two that it made me that he turned the corner.
*  I mean, he is hitting his mid twenties.
*  You know, I, I, here's a good example.
*  And this doesn't show up in the box score, but Edward starts out and there's flames
*  shooting out of his ass and it's just clear he's going to have at least 40 points.
*  Right.
*  And then all of a sudden Towns is like, now it's my turn.
*  He did that.
*  He did that thing for you.
*  For when somebody who was going to have the game Edwards was going to have tonight, where he was,
*  I thought he was absolutely spectacular and actually saw him tired in the fourth quarter,
*  which I don't think we've seen him tired ever.
*  He got tired in the third quarter after he went on that barrage.
*  Yeah.
*  And then there was a moment where he was like, he had to take a couple of possessions off.
*  Like you could see it from him.
*  So you're right.
*  It was like a Drago.
*  Oh my God.
*  The Russian is caught.
*  It was like, Oh my God, Edwards gets tired.
*  But I think with Edwards, especially the way he's playing tonight, you just want supporting
*  actors with him when he's going to have a game like that.
*  You want like, this is heat and he's De Niro and Pacino combined.
*  You want towns to be Sizemore where he's going to have like three scenes and he's
*  then he's going to do his for me, the action is the juice.
*  It's like, Oh cool.
*  Tom Sizemore had a moment.
*  Now get out of the way.
*  We're going to get back to De Niro and Pacino, but towns is just, I feel like he thinks it's
*  the two of them together.
*  And tonight was a night when it was not.
*  This was a, the other guy that I just felt like wasn't involved enough was Conley.
*  Cause I like the matchups Conley has in this series, right?
*  We've seen point guards over and over again, be able to get into the paint, do slash and
*  kick stuff and just create offense.
*  And a lot of times he's just standing over on the side because everything has to run
*  through Edwards and towns.
*  Do you think Chris Finch being injured actually might've cost them a game here in the series
*  that are the first four?
*  I mean, I voted for him second and coach coach of the year.
*  No, cause he's right there.
*  It's different though.
*  He's not, you're walking around.
*  Wait, like when you're actually coaching and you're able to move and move up and down the
*  sidelines and talk to your guys versus I'm just sitting on the side.
*  Like I'm like Denzel and the bone collector.
*  Like I just don't think it's the same.
*  Cause I thought they lost their composure and did some weird shit tonight.
*  It was a really sloppy offensive.
*  Like I just thought their identity was all over the place.
*  If they didn't have the game that he had, they would have lost by 25.
*  Yeah.
*  I couldn't believe like there's a bunch of moments where I go, okay, six minutes.
*  They're down 11.
*  Like they're, are they going to grind this thing out?
*  Are they going to find a way to grind the whole thing out?
*  But there's just too many moments where I didn't, I didn't trust anybody else around.
*  And whether it's the cat stuff that we've already talked about and you know, Rudy ended
*  up with some points because he got fouled a bunch of times here at the end.
*  But he just had those moments with him where, you know, with the ball in his hands,
*  you're like, ah, man, what's his post up against Yocich.
*  That's going to end up on T that's going to end up on TNT at some point.
*  Like Yocich just chest moving him to be like, oh wait, you think you're going to like
*  McHale me right now?
*  I'm just going to matador off to the side.
*  You're not even going to feel me because you're so uncomfortable already.
*  And then Rudy like gets called for the travel that'll be in, that'll be in some like one
*  shining moment version of the NBA broadcast.
*  So wait, can you hold on for on that for one second?
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I think for guys like us, we've never blocked, we've never had a chase down block
*  against the backboard.
*  No, but we have pulled the chair.
*  I'm retired now, but when you pull the chair in a really good way, where the guy almost
*  like falls over and hits his face, it's about as satisfying of a defensive moment as you
*  can have.
*  Right.
*  What's better?
*  I don't like when people do it outside on the asphalt.
*  I think it's bullshit.
*  What about inside?
*  I like, I didn't realize you were anti pulling the chair.
*  Yeah.
*  I just think it means you can't play defense.
*  I guess I've just had too many people pull the chair when I was younger.
*  You know, some older guy, lunch hoops.
*  Do you want to do a PSA?
*  Should we do a PSA for the Ringer NBA channel?
*  I'm Ryan.
*  We're still going to get killed for even bringing it up.
*  I want to talk about pulling the chair.
*  Yeah.
*  Now he's going to.
*  No, the way to, the, when, when you pull the chair, when I, when it's okay,
*  is when you're going against the tall guy who thinks he can just swing into you with
*  his elbows out and just basically bulldoze over you.
*  And that's when it's okay.
*  No, that's, um, I don't, I don't think you're wrong.
*  I think we'll agree to disagree.
*  Yeah, then we can disagree.
*  Sometimes I think more people will agree with you and I understand the position.
*  Hey, at least it's not a charge.
*  At least it's not a charge because you started trying to like slide over outside
*  in a pickup game and then you just decide it's the charge.
*  Like if you put the effort in and then get hit and then fall down, no one has ever in
*  the history of pickup.
*  First of all, you shouldn't do it in the first place, but nobody would ever be like,
*  I think I was still moving.
*  The guys always like charge.
*  Be like, someone else has to see it for you to be able to get the call.
*  Like, what are you, what are you kidding?
*  Anyway, everybody's favorite part of the pod.
*  Just quickly on Denver, we talked about, uh, what a great moment this was for them.
*  I think the three days off helped everybody, including myself, just pouring dirt on them,
*  being like, it's fine, man.
*  It's really hard to go back to back, especially with how deep the league is now.
*  The amount of pride that they showed in game three, where they just came out,
*  throwing haymakers with their and got their identity back, just rebuilt it over the course
*  of 72 hours and then winning that game today, the crowd seemed like it was good both nights too,
*  but winning that, that game today on the road with the way Edwards was playing.
*  I thought the crowd was better tonight.
*  I think they were, I think they were so ready to just erupt in game three.
*  You know, this is a Minnesota franchise that hasn't felt anything like this.
*  This is the Steve Kerr theory.
*  Steve Kerr always said the, the young, the young playoff team that hasn't had a lot of
*  great playoff moments that first came home, the crowds almost so fired up.
*  It was like game three, net Celtics when the salts had the big comeback in the second half,
*  but that first half they suck.
*  Cause the crowds like, ah, let's go.
*  Everyone's in the seats 45 minutes for the game.
*  And then somebody makes two threes and the other team and you're like, what?
*  Oh no, what's going on?
*  It's just like, it doesn't go by the plans, but, um, I just love when champs defend the title,
*  which we've talked about.
*  I don't know how we've been doing this probably for seven years on Sundays.
*  My favorite, I think it's one thing to win the championship.
*  I think it's another thing to defend it.
*  It's something I wrote about in my book.
*  I really feel like the title defense should count when you talk about the great teams.
*  And I love that they fought back because I didn't think they were going to.
*  I really thought this was going to be a passing of the torch.
*  They had no chance in Minnesota.
*  That the series as blown as I, as blown away as I was in game two, I guess.
*  Then once I started seeing everything that was happening in the TV shows and everything,
*  the question I'd ask like any of us is haven't you watched series before though?
*  Like we've been doing this 40 years.
*  I know, but this is unusual.
*  Do you see this stat?
*  This only five times somebody has lost the first two at home and then won the series five times ever.
*  I'm not even talking about game four because I didn't know what was going to happen in game four.
*  But for Denver, for Denver, who we, we both think is really good,
*  you know, before we saw the Minnesota Phoenix series, before we saw the Denver and LA series,
*  I think both of us were like leaning towards, I know we both weren't going to pick Boston
*  against Denver unless you saw some version of Boston running.
*  Right.
*  So I just think there's so many moments in a series where the teams look completely different
*  48 hours later.
*  And I guess I feel like sometimes I'll be just listening to stuff going,
*  wait, this is your first year doing this?
*  Not you necessarily, but this Denver's too good to have had everybody being like,
*  this is a wrap.
*  And there was just so many people talking sweep.
*  I was surprised.
*  I think the Murray thing was a big piece of that though.
*  Cause that's your out then that's your, no, it's not even an out.
*  He just looked like he was legitimately hurt and it wasn't going to get better,
*  you know?
*  And I don't know if they, if they did the Mexico, Miami, Germany trip between game two and game
*  three, but he looked way better and was moving way better and looked like Jamal Murray again.
*  And that was a guy I did not expect to, uh, to see in the, in the playoffs.
*  He was 11 for 21 in game three.
*  Today was eight for 17.
*  Um, aunt finished with 44 and was 16 for 25, but we didn't mention this yet.
*  Sometimes this happens in a basketball game.
*  We just know the other team's going to lose.
*  And that eight point barrage at the end of the second quarter was just so stupid.
*  It's like, nobody's, nobody's ever won when this, when they did something this stupid
*  at the end of a half.
*  And that turned out to be the eight point and that eight point cushion they had the
*  whole second half basically with these 20 seconds that they just fucked up.
*  They give up the Pope three, then you get to turn over.
*  Okay, fine.
*  But in a game,
*  the McDaniels doesn't run back.
*  Right.
*  Gordon just goes down.
*  But to inbound it that way, knowing there's like as, as rare as the chance is, but to
*  even open yourself up.
*  And I think that's one thing that you've always talked about with the playoffs that we see
*  it play out all the time with just certain people aren't comfortable as the series goes
*  on.
*  And I don't even know if that's what happened there.
*  It's like, oh, this young team, they just weren't smart enough.
*  They weren't comfortable.
*  Although I thought there's just a lot of dumb stuff that's been happening with them.
*  On top of everything else.
*  But I, that, that eight point swing, because you're like, Hey, this has been a
*  Denver can't miss.
*  Yoke, it's just been incredible.
*  And all of a sudden it goes from what it would have been.
*  And then it'd be a 50.
*  So was this going to be a seven point halftime lead to a 15 point half?
*  They get a stop at seven points.
*  It goes to 15 instead.
*  I have to talk about this, even though it's the most sports radio topic possible.
*  I couldn't believe they didn't suspend Murray for game three because any other time we've
*  had that kind of situation in the NBA playoffs, they've always defaulted to look, we can't
*  say there's special circumstances here because it's a huge game for the other team or whatever.
*  It's just the rules, the rule, the rule got broken and it's a suspension.
*  And yet in this case, they didn't suspend them and they find them a hundred thousand
*  dollars, but didn't suspend them.
*  And what he did was clearly a one game suspension.
*  I guess there's less precedent because I was thinking about like the Oh seven Phoenix is
*  the all time worst for me when he throws an ash against the scores table and the guys on his bench,
*  you see their leader get thrown against the scores table, take like five feet of steps toward it
*  for stopping.
*  And then I got, you guys got to sit out now.
*  The 97 Knicks heat, which I'd kind of, it's so long ago, I forgot, but they stern staggered
*  the suspensions, spend their best five guys over two days because they left the bench.
*  And then dream on was the other one where they could have rescinded the 16th, whatever
*  technical and they decided not to.
*  And then Cleveland comes back in 2016, but over and over again, they've told us like,
*  Hey, we don't play favorites with this shit.
*  The rules are the rules.
*  And in this case, they, I felt like they totally played favorites with this.
*  They're like, ah, we can't suspend Murray.
*  Then they're not, then they have no chance in the series.
*  I thought it was crazy.
*  Was it low?
*  You're probably right.
*  I didn't care.
*  It didn't bother me.
*  Well, I would rather they handled it this way, but now I want to go back retroactively
*  and be like, could we have done that with some of the other ones now?
*  Could we get Stoudamire and De'Aida playing game five now?
*  Can we get Draymond to actually play in game five and try to finish off the title?
*  It just feels like it had no correlation to the rest of the NBA history.
*  Do you remember when David Stern went on with Dan Patrick for that sun's thing?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if you're arrogant about it.
*  No, he was arrogant about it the whole time.
*  Stern came on and I don't know if it was booked ahead of time,
*  but I think Stern may have reached out because at that point, Dan's doing the number one
*  afternoon show in the country and Dan's whole point was, hey, this is what I've always said
*  about a lot of this stuff.
*  I don't, the punishment is not consistent.
*  When people are like, oh, I just want the officiating to be consistent.
*  I want this to be consistent.
*  It's like, well, then you're hoping for something that's never going to happen
*  because there's nothing in life with punishment and what happens to people.
*  Hey, it happened to this guy, but yeah, but this guy, he's like, yeah, okay.
*  Welcome to this game that we all sign up for.
*  When it comes to punishment and like, okay, well, it should have been this.
*  When Jeremon Green chimes in, it's like, well, hey, dude, you think there might be
*  a little bit of a difference based on your background and everything else.
*  Your track record is really what I should have been looking for there.
*  But I remember Stern coming on because Dan Patrick was just like, hey, this is one of
*  those things in the gray area where you shouldn't be this punitive.
*  You should be able to say like, hey, the intent was this, but then it was kind of
*  stopped and if you're going letter by the law, like this is way too harsh and it could
*  very well decide the outcome of his series here because that Sunstein was everybody loved it.
*  We didn't want to see it go down that way.
*  And Stern came on and was like, you're wrong.
*  You're wrong.
*  And he's like, you are an opinion maker.
*  You shape opinion.
*  And Dan Patrick must have said Mr.
*  Commissioner 50 times in the back and forth.
*  He's like, yes, but Mr.
*  Commissioner.
*  Stern was scary when it got like that.
*  I've faced the wrath a couple of times.
*  You're on your heels.
*  He becomes like a prosecutor and you're on trial.
*  Yeah, just going at you.
*  I can't describe how scary it is.
*  It was scary.
*  Listen to it.
*  Yeah, it was just awesome audio and Patrick was just really like good with the way he did
*  it because he was still like he wasn't really packing down, but Stern was just going to
*  steamroll him.
*  The reason I even bring up any of that stuff, though, I don't think Silver goes that way.
*  I think Silver is somebody that his approach to this, if Murray, for the most part, has
*  been a really good guy, is I don't want to take a player out of this spot because that
*  might have been the series.
*  And I know some people could have a huge problem.
*  I'd rather have played out the way that it did.
*  But I would have rather had the same thing happen in 07 with the Suns that I rather would
*  have had Draymond play.
*  I just not like I remember Parish when he beat the shit out of Lambir in Game 5 1987,
*  one of the greatest moments of my life.
*  And then to stay in the game.
*  Even though he had a band.
*  It's it's somewhere in there.
*  I'd group it with with having two kids and they won the game and they went up three,
*  two and then the league suspended Parish for Game six.
*  It was the fucking best.
*  Even after he had just basically committed assault on Lambir in Game five, they just
*  left him in, let him play the rest of the game.
*  So they've been all over the map with this stuff.
*  But for the most part, they've always defaulted to the rules of the rules.
*  And, you know, I thought what Murray did, I that's about as an easy of a one game
*  suspension.
*  And I'm a I'm a Yokoch fan.
*  I wanted the series to keep going.
*  I didn't want him to get suspended.
*  I just assumed he was going to get suspended.
*  So predictions going forward.
*  I mean, the series is now impossible to predict, but Denver is going to try to do
*  something that would put them in a pretty special category to come back from O2
*  down, losing the first two at home.
*  Only five teams have done it.
*  They had that on the broadcast at the end of it tonight.
*  For me to say, hey, I still like Minnesota because I picked them.
*  I mean, who's going to sit here today after those two games?
*  It would make sense.
*  Hey, young team, little too soon feeling themselves after the game to success.
*  Denver figured them out.
*  You know, when this game is 10 points down the stretch, you're like, Denver's not
*  going to get bad looks here.
*  Is Minnesota going to get good looks?
*  Like, is it going to have to be ant the entire time?
*  I'm not ready to just write off Minnesota, despite what we've just seen through the
*  first four games.
*  Maybe this is Minnesota.
*  You know, do they figure out this year?
*  Do they figure out, you know, do they figure out between games four and five or
*  they figure out this summer?
*  Right.
*  It's one of those.
*  And we've seen this a lot of times in NBA history where just an awesome seven game
*  series, they give them everyone's hugging afterwards.
*  Like, wow, you really brought the best out of us.
*  Might be their destiny, but I still like the way I like the way they played
*  defensively today.
*  I don't know if Denver can do that again.
*  I have no idea what's going to happen the rest of the way.
*  Like to me, this is now an official.
*  I'm not betting on the series anymore.
*  No, it feels it just feels seven and it feels like it's going to come down to
*  something.
*  There's some at this point.
*  You know, if you said, hey, I just trucked, I trust Jokic to get two of these down
*  the stretch more than anybody else out there.
*  As much as we all love ant, you're right.
*  Here's something I thought was really important, though, because
*  if you looked at the regular season to the playoff numbers of the on off with
*  Jokic thing, and we know over the course of the regular season, it becomes this
*  absurd number and part of it is Denver's bench isn't all that great, but it's
*  like those first few minutes of the second quarter.
*  It's those first few minutes when he comes in, depending on the regular
*  season, the game, the matchup comes in nine, eight minutes left in the game.
*  If they're way ahead, it's later.
*  But those numbers like shape this thing with Jokic, but then Jokic plays more
*  minutes in the playoffs and the bench thing wasn't getting destroyed against
*  LA as much.
*  But tonight I was looking for it.
*  Jokic sits after the first quarter and Denver goes up nine points with him
*  sitting at the beginning of the second.
*  That doesn't happen.
*  Okay.
*  That doesn't happen.
*  And then Jokic picks up the fourth foul in the third quarter.
*  They, they sit him with six minutes to go.
*  So that's not even close to his normal rotation.
*  He'll play the full third and then sit in the beginning of the fourth, depending
*  on how the game is going.
*  He's not afraid to put him back in earlier.
*  So you're thinking, wait, we're going to get six minutes without Jokic out there.
*  And then Denver doesn't miss a shot.
*  Now, granted they lost four points in those six minutes, you know, up, I think
*  it was either 13 to nine or 15 to 11.
*  That's a huge win to only lose four points when Jokic isn't playing for six
*  minutes, but then you're also going to get him fresh at the start of the fourth,
*  as opposed to having to wait for him for a little while.
*  And he has 16 in the fourth.
*  This, that was, look, there's a million things you can point to say, hey, the
*  game was this, the game was that game.
*  When I saw those numbers, I went, that's, that's incredible.
*  That entire time.
*  Well, there's one other number along what you just said.
*  Edwards had to play 45 because they couldn't take him out of the game.
*  Like he couldn't come out today.
*  That was it.
*  Like, and he was not just playing offense, but he was playing like real defense on
*  the other side too.
*  And I think Minnesota has to figure out how either towns or Nazarite can carry
*  them for four minutes a half because probably not sustainable.
*  Well, not in any shots again, too.
*  And, you know, Conley's going to have some moments here or there.
*  The cat one for 10 start was brutal.
*  Rudy's not providing anything offensively until the very end.
*  And you hit on it, but we, we spent more time on the cat stuff.
*  Hey, when game two happened, I brought it up as kind of a joke of like, hey,
*  this is how good they looked without Rudy.
*  Like, huh?
*  And I'm like, hey, look, even me with my Rudy position, that's completely unfair
*  to Rudy go bear that there's this one game they were this dominant defensively
*  and didn't happen.
*  But now, you know, he didn't have a great game three.
*  He's always going to have some moments defensively.
*  They're incredible.
*  He had a closeout contest on Murray where he stayed in front of him late when
*  it was still a huge possession.
*  And you're like, man, look at him working his ass off, staying in front of him.
*  Then he came out at like three 33 and I was like, oh my God, are they going to do it?
*  Are they going to do it to just try to get more offense on the floor?
*  And then they brought him back in the game.
*  It's just something.
*  Let me put it this way.
*  I'm monitoring that situation.
*  Me as well.
*  I don't know who's going to win and I'm not making a prediction.
*  I really thought Minnesota was going to sweep them.
*  I thought Murray was hurt and I thought that was it for Denver.
*  And it was, you know, they won last year and shit happens.
*  Now I don't know what to think.
