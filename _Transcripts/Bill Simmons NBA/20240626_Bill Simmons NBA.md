# NBA Draft Takes: Scary Sarr, Dillingham Excitement and Edey Underrated? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ16_xVJedw)
*  Casual bill is here with some poorly crafted, uh, half-ass draft takes, but, um,
*  okay, let's see.
*  Is it more fun when the draft sucks?
*  Why is it more fun to have just all of these like maybe sort ofs?
*  I could talk myself into this kind of, it's just, I feel like teams are going to draft by needs and
*  all hell is going to break loose on Wednesday night.
*  Would you rather have a draft loaded or a draft that's weird like this?
*  A draft that's uncertainty, uncertain.
*  That's what makes it fun to me.
*  Cause I think you can have that type of uncertain atmosphere with like a lot of great prospects,
*  but the fact that this year we don't know what's going to be happening at number one,
*  we don't know who's going to be picking where with all the trade discussions that are happening.
*  That's what makes it really fun to me.
*  Cause it's not even just like that at the top five or the top three.
*  It's like that at number 10, but we get like a thon maker level surprise there.
*  Or we're like, who's going to be taken at like number 17 or number 25 out of the, you know,
*  40 or so guys that you could argue belong in the top 20.
*  It's like one of those weird deep years at each level of the draft.
*  So I love all the uncertainty that's made like a lot of discussions fun with,
*  you know, with like Kyle over the recent weeks with the draft show and,
*  and then talking to people around the league through the process too.
*  It's, it's, nobody really knows what's going to happen even just one day out.
*  Well, we've all been texting a lot.
*  I mean, first of all, Reese's Shay is like, pretty much still a consensus,
*  number one pick and none of us really totally see it.
*  So there's that.
*  And then you have SAR who is either going to go first or second.
*  It seems like, um, project, I think it's fair to say some,
*  some curiousness about him just in general, not really caring whether he goes first or not.
*  I think I really want to unpack that Kyle, just
*  from a psychological standpoint, somebody who's like, oh yeah, I don't really care
*  if I work out for the team with the number one pick because they might not be the best fit.
*  I just would like to go to a team that I could get minutes on just fundamentally.
*  Seems weird to me.
*  Where do you stand on it?
*  Yeah. It's like, you'd like to see some of that like chip on the shoulder.
*  Um, just that nuclear sort of like engine in a player, like the thing, the,
*  the Luca like snarling at the camera level type nasty shit.
*  But maybe in this draft where there's sort of an absence of like a projected primary,
*  like offensive, like a star level talent, maybe, maybe we're looking for that and it's not,
*  not there.
*  And maybe it's like a sort of like a temptation, a pitfall to read into it too much, you know,
*  at the same time, because maybe, maybe he's smart and he wants to go to the best fit.
*  I don't know. I'm trying to make like excuses for him.
*  Kevin, I mean, Kevin, when you rattled through like all the different places he went,
*  when you started to lay it out like that, I was like, oh, that is a little more concerning
*  maybe than, than I had originally thought.
*  Do the list, KOC.
*  I mean, so, I mean, he's started outside of Real Madrid.
*  He left them obviously a big international team.
*  He left there to go play at overtime elite brand new league, lower level of competition.
*  And then when it's time to leave OTE, rather than stay in the United States, go to a big school or,
*  or even go to the G league where, as we saw this past season with Holland and Buzella,
*  tough level of competition with all the talent in the G league now, he instead goes to play in
*  Australia as a bench guy, playing behind veterans on a team, trying to make the playoffs.
*  And then when it comes time, you know, to work out for the number one pick,
*  he decides not to do that as well.
*  And so like, there's been a history for years now with him kind of, you know, avoiding that
*  toughest path. And I like the people you talked to around the league that are on the more skeptical
*  side of SAR. A lot of people look at that history and there's concern there when you also factor in
*  on the floor. You know, I talked with, you know, Damian Wilkins, who is like the head of scouting
*  GM of overtime elite, former NBA player. And we talked about SAR and Dillingham and other
*  OTE prospects. And with SAR, he's like, well, we got him in, he just wanted to play in the perimeter.
*  We had to teach him to be a guy to attack the rim. Like he's like, he wasn't being aggressive.
*  We taught him nobody can stop you. Well, this year in the NBL, he shot 48% on layups at the rim.
*  He's kind of contact adverse. And like, you know, as Kyle and I have talked about throughout the
*  year, it's like he, he, he feels like he should be like this versatile beast. This like people
*  compare him to Derrick Lively, but he's not that level of athlete or dunker or finisher.
*  And so I just feel like with SAR factoring in the off court stuff with those decisions,
*  then the on court performance, it's just too much theoretical for me to want to put him at number one
*  on my board this year. And I can see, I can see why Atlanta, even if they did work him out,
*  wouldn't want to take him. Sounds like the perfect wizard to me. Everything you just laid out seems
*  just classic. Usually, usually when you, usually when you have a 48 percenter like that, who's big
*  like that, you usually have it with like the caveat of like, okay, well like Brandon Miller's
*  a little smaller or I'm just trying to think of like guys who are like true pick and pop bigs
*  or sort of upright perimeter guys who justifiably have a preference to be out there and to do that.
*  But the shot is really shaky too. You know, he, he kind of, I always say he kind of has this
*  low on his shoulder. He shoots like Tarii Eason sort of low into the side on his shoulder. It's
*  not like it's impossible that it can never come around, but the finishing and then you combine it
*  with the sort of like avoiding the hardest path. Those, those flaws are visible even with him
*  choosing the lesser path. So it just kind of makes you think like, where would we be? Where would we
*  be if he had chosen, chosen this other path and expose those flaws even more? Would we, you know,
*  it feels like we're all three kind of hanging on by thread in our belief in him. It kind of makes
*  me think we'd be totally out if he had chosen that hard path. And, and how much are we also anchoring
*  him to the pretty good week he had against the Ignite where he like locked down Ron Holland on
*  a handful of possessions. He had two good games, but then he had a pretty forgettable entire
*  season in Australia. I mean, it was okay, but it was nothing special in a bench role. So like how
*  much of it is like, he's just anchored after that week against the Ignite rather than like, even
*  prior to that game, I think I had him like 16 or 17 on my, you know, preseason board. He was like
*  solid, but nothing spectacular. And at this point now I moved him down to six and I feel
*  solid with him there. But even then, I mean, I'm like, I'd rather somebody else take him to be the
*  GM that ends up taking Alex R. Yeah. I mean, I keep thinking of what Tate texted us. Sorry, Tate's not
*  here. Tate's on like 40 ringer shows this week. So I thought I'd give him a break, but Tate, Tate
*  was saying how would you take a guy first or second who didn't feel really strongly that he
*  should be the first pick in the draft? And I had never thought of it that way, but I was thinking
*  like, maybe that's a way to think about this stuff. Like if you asked Anthony Edwards in 2020,
*  Hey, who do you think should be the top player in this draft? And he would be like, not only should
*  I be the first player in this draft, but also in the NFL draft and the MLB draft, I should be first
*  in all the drafts. I think they should give a polygraph before each draft cycle to the players
*  that might go and be like, if you and LeBron were in the same draft, should you go first? Like we
*  just test how wildly crazy confident they are. Just kind of give them a rating based on that.
*  And then the NBA should mandate that and release it to the public so we could have it. I mean,
*  one of the reasons that like, one of the many reasons I like Steph Castle is like, I think if
*  you asked him that, I think he would genuinely believe he should be the first pick in the draft.
*  Right. I think Dillingham for better and worse would think he's the best draft though question,
*  but it is an interesting way to think about it. I asked Castle a similar question, Bill,
*  when I interviewed him on Monday and I asked him like, do you think you can become a top 10 to 15
*  player? And his answer wasn't like as maybe as confident as you would hoped it was more.
*  That's what I want to be. That's the goal. That's what everyone's goal should be. And I'm going to
*  work as hard as I can to become that. So I would assume he would have had a similar answer if I had
*  asked exactly the question you did about do you, should you be the number one pick of the drafts?
*  Yeah, I remember a million years ago when Jalen and I did the, we did this interview series with
*  other draft picks in 2013 and we were like really like putting thought into how they answered stuff.
*  And the two guys that jumped out from a confidence standpoint were Odeepo and McCollum,
*  just the way they handled themselves, their answers and like their confidence. And
*  you do realize like when you're running these teams, you could get so swayed one way or the
*  other by how somebody handles stupid things like that. But I, I say this every year,
*  the draft isn't an exact science, but especially in a stupid draft like this, where it's basically
*  like the, the top five doesn't exist. It's just, we're basically starting at pick six and you have
*  to think of it that way or pick four or whatever you want to start it. I just want to go with like,
*  what are you, what's the one or two things you're just really good at?
*  And, and that's it. So if we, if we go through the draft of like the top guys, what are you really,
*  really, really good at? It becomes a little easier, right? Cause Klingon it's like rim protection,
*  lobs. Okay. Those are two things. That's like Derek Leiby last year. Those are the
*  recipe for if you redid last year's draft, uh, castles, like athleticism, perimeter defense,
*  like, Oh, that's somebody that could play in a playoff series, Reed Shepard, shooting,
*  dealing him really crazy high offensive ceiling and so on and so on. When I get to like the,
*  the SAR research, like research who we got to talk about why he's the consensus number one pick,
*  but nobody actually has a number one on a board that we've seen. And it's like the research from
*  what I am. I'm back out to not liking them. I liked them Sunday and now I'm kind of drifting
*  away from it, but the best case scenario for him is basically like Troy, uh, Trey Murphy, right?
*  I was like Troy Murphy. Oh God. I got a Troy Murphy comp in the guy Quentin posts seven foot
*  on a Boston college contract. But Reese's shake. Couldn't you say that that's like his best case
*  in the era is that he could become Trey Murphy. No, I don't think so. I think Trey Murphy's got
*  a flame thrower jumper and Reese doesn't. He's a clip man. Like Trey Murphy is flame. I'm giving
*  you the best case. I mean, in the, in, I have my, for my shades of Harrison Barnes to bias Harris,
*  like a little bit more sneaky as a shooter, that alarm Joe house, just for the record,
*  Joe has saw those two names. It's like, I'm out. No, I mean, I get it with Reese's she, I get,
*  well, you know, the six, eight, you know, he's versatile defensively. He's really good as an
*  off-ball defender. You can switch them and play different schemes and all that. I get that he
*  shot almost 40% from three this year. But the fact is, is that he really only had two good months
*  shooting the ball in his entire lifetime. But if you're taking the first, you better think he's as
*  good of a shooter as Trey Murphy potentially someday. Otherwise I don't understand why you
*  would do it. I don't either. I really don't. I mean, look, he, he shot like 48% from three,
*  the first two months of the season playing in France. And then he shot below 30% for the
*  remainder of the year, which is pretty similar to what he did every other year of his career
*  playing professionally. And he's been around a 70% guy from the free throw line. He is not a shot
*  creator, does not get to the rim a lot, is not much of a playmaker. And I think he's a very good
*  defender, but not necessarily, you know, he's not Herb Jones. He's not that type of guy on defense.
*  So I just have a hard time with him at one. He feels like if, if the Spurs or some team feel
*  really good about him as a shooter and what he can be long-term, I think he's going to be a good
*  role player, but I don't think he's worth number one for Atlanta or, you know, Washington at two,
*  for that matter. And he doesn't really make sense for Houston at three. And so it's not until four
*  with the Spurs. And I'm like, okay, I, this makes some sense to me. Where do you stand on that one,
*  Kyle? I'm with him on that. I mean, I, you think about like the outcomes that we're, we're like
*  willing to accept with him. And I think that like, if he's a rotation, if he's in my rotation and he
*  comes in and he can make like, I don't want to like overdo it with how shaky the shooting is.
*  Like he was 41.4% on spot up looks. You got to think about the types of shots that he's going
*  to be taking. Like he's probably going to be attacking like straight line drives. He's not,
*  he does have some nice touch around the basket when you, he's a smooth mover. He doesn't look like,
*  like I don't think he's as stiff as Tobias, but yeah, in terms of like being a help kind of scheme
*  defender, I think he'll hold up pretty well. It's just, are you betting on like the growth plate
*  on his game? Like, are you, are you saying this is a guy that we think could become like a
*  facilitator? Probably not. Like he's probably going to become like a connective, like pass it off the
*  catch guy at best, I think. And I think that's somebody worth taking a gamble on, like in the
*  like five to, or like eight to 13, he kind of range for me. Yeah, that sounds great. So why is
*  Gavoni so adamant that he's going to be the first pick? I don't understand it. Well, I have Gavoni
*  on the draft show, the way Gavoni, you know, spelled out to me is like, he's been a high volume
*  shooter for years now. He's taken a lot of shots and Gavoni told a story about how he was on a
*  plane with him once and there, you know, they're sitting, you know, in these crunch seats in a
*  middle seat. And he's like, well, you put him in an NBA situation where he's got daytime off and
*  NBA training and conditioning that that shot will fall, fall more consistency. My thing with that
*  is, yeah, but he's been a 70% guy from the free throw line. I don't think all that changes. He's
*  never been an elite touch guy. So it's like a really big bet on projecting that shot to become a 40%
*  or near 40% guy like he was for two months this season. And I'm just, I'm just not there with him.
*  I think there's other guys who, you know, are safer bets. There's other upside plays, Ron Holland
*  being one of them, you know, I still take sorrow over him. And how would you had run on number one
*  today in his list? Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. Yeah. There's still some Holland supporters out
*  there. Wasserman over at Bleacher Report has Holland number one as well. So it's like, well,
*  Holland had the classic people got bored of where he was in the draft list because he'd been there
*  for a while. And then you start talking. It's like it happens with quarterbacks sometimes too.
*  Yeah. Oh, sorry. I go, I was going to say that archetype, Kevin, and I talked about this before
*  the year. I think I kind of forecasted my working and you don't want to like sort of like lead
*  yourself to a bad opinion. But at the beginning of the year, I was like, I worry about this
*  archetype sometimes of this like big kid on the playground guy who like in that like grassroots,
*  like high school, they're in high school, they're physically mature, but maybe he's a little more
*  mature than his, than his peers. And he kind of establishes himself as the guy we've seen that
*  happen over and over again, whether it's like Stanley Johnson or it's, uh, you know, uh, who was,
*  who were the other ones we were thinking of? I mean, Michael Kidd Gilchrist just couldn't shoot
*  the ball at all. I mean, that's another one, Josh Jackson. Um, just that archetype can have problems
*  sometimes, but Holland does project. I was making a list of my guys that are like most likely,
*  you know, in the little subcategories, like to become like a tough assignment defensive guy,
*  like he could buy into that. And I think Holland projects as somebody that could definitely do that
*  research research. I don't, I don't really see that with him to be honest with you.
*  See, this is why this is such a great draft guys, because there's multiple people where you almost
*  feel like you have to have a hard take one or the other. And there's going to be some stuff that
*  can get cut out a year from now and be like, Oh, I remember when you said so and so, and then it
*  turned out to be this way. That's why I would just like, if I was running one of these top four teams,
*  especially, I just want the guys that I know are going to be at least good. I'm not trying to get
*  like an all MBA multi-year, whatever. I'm just trying to get somebody who could be a really good
*  starter. And how many guys is that that we would kind of bet would at least be really good starters?
*  Right. That's Castle. That's Klingon. Would you put Ron Holland on that list?
*  No, I wouldn't cause it's like a, you get nervous with that. Reed Shepherd could be,
*  who was the one that mentioned on one of your pods, but the Mark Price comp, I did like,
*  I started defending that today. Yeah. I did like a, I did like a joke. I didn't mind it. You know,
*  Mark Price obviously had a pretty big college resume and he was good. And he's to me, he's like
*  the lost great point guard of the eighties and nineties and blew out his knee at the worst possible
*  time, like right in his prime. I don't know if Reed Shepherd can manage the game like that,
*  but I did, I didn't mind the comp. It's somewhere he's somewhere Mark Price on the highest possible
*  side and Prichard probably in the lowest possible side. And he's somewhere in there, I would say.
*  But he did from all accounts really improved over the last year. And you, Kyle, you got to watch him
*  a ton, obviously, but you know, he's definitely going to be in the top seven of a good team at
*  some point in his career with the shooting. The shooting is like unnaturally good.
*  The defense could push him, could be, could be the thing that's a big enough problem because he is
*  small. I mean, he has the one, the one thing about him is that he just has interesting, like,
*  over his game is an interesting Venn diagram where you don't really get the pull up shooting that he
*  has with, I mean, you get the passing in the, in the like floor, like court mapping stuff. Like he,
*  he has a very smart basketball brain in terms of like knowing the geometry of where, where and how
*  to like exploit advantages and things like that. But like he has defensive hands that are just really
*  unusual. Like they're really strong and really accurate. You'll, you'll see him like come,
*  like there'll be a scrum around the basket and Reid will just get his hand exactly on it right
*  where it needs to be and pop the ball loose. He does that kind of stuff all the time. The problem
*  is that he is probably like six one. And he was basically a turn, like he's going to have to get
*  a lot stronger in the NBA and be more of a deliberate pace player, I think to like not be
*  exploited all the time, because I think he's, I don't know, Kevin, do you think his hands are good
*  enough to be like, they're great, but it's weird that we have this like incredible like disruptive
*  skillset, but he also is just kind of small. He's going to get targeted in serious games.
*  Brian Smith I mean, he's only a quarter of an inch
*  shorter than Stephen Curry. His wingspan is only a quarter of an inch shorter than Stephen Curry.
*  He weighed in the same as Steph when Steph was at the combine. Steph obviously went up to like 190,
*  195 pounds.
*  Chris Bounds Bill lit up when you said that.
*  Wow.
*  Brian Smith So he's small, but like he's not much smaller than Stephen Curry. So I think if he's in
*  the right situation and the right environment, you're talking about a guy who had five steals
*  five times this season. There's only three other guys in college basketball who did that all year
*  long. He had three blocks, three pointers in the final two minutes of three, three separate games
*  this entire season. So he's clutch with those defensive plays as well. And like you said,
*  he's got that instinct Kyle with those good hands looking for loose balls and the interceptions and
*  everything else. I think Shepherd offers enough intangibles on defense that yes, even though he's
*  smaller and yes, even though he's going to get targeted, I mean, like the environment's everything
*  and ultimately if he lands on the spurs and you get Victor back there and with other long arm
*  defenders, I don't know how much that's going to matter when you talk about a guy that hit over
*  50% of his threes this year. And it has Ryan raved about to you like two weeks ago, Bill,
*  on your podcast, 95th percentile and everything catching shoot unguarded guarded dribble pull up
*  for mid range from three. I think reads kind of dribble game is a little bit underrated. Like he's
*  got a pull up from mid range where he can do it like pretty easily. Like out of his dribble motion,
*  it's not like there's a stop and needs to gather. Like he does it seamlessly when he's handling the
*  ball. He's a great passer in the open court, which is why like you and Tate, when you're going back
*  and forth with your comp, you're like, well, Mark Price, a little long ball with the passing ability.
*  I mean, I just said, screw it. These are all players I like. No, you've been thinking about him at
*  number one and in that range for a couple of months there. I said, screw it. I just did it. I put him
*  at one because it's the same logic that you were talking about, Bill, who were the guys that I
*  think are going to be good? Shepherd, I think is going to be really good. Klingon, I think is going
*  to be really good. And Castle, I think are going to be really good. So I put them one, two, three on
*  my board and I feel good about it. I think that's smart. I really think, especially the Derrick
*  Lively thing, I think was really instructive because I remember us talking about that last,
*  you guys talked about him endlessly on all our draft pods. And the question was like, was he just
*  on the wrong team at Duke? Because this guy has specific skills that if the right team drafts him,
*  he could really unlock. And I think Lively has even been better than any of us ever could have
*  imagined last year. He really, especially at the, you know, I went to all the finals games, he really
*  jumped out in person in those at Dallas games where you're just like, wow, this guy might actually,
*  they might have three all-stars here two years from now if Kyrie can stay at that level. Because he
*  was that impactful as a rim protector, passer, creator. So we kind of saw that last year.
*  In Klingon's case, pretty easy to see at least like what, like is he better Walker Kessler?
*  Could he become like a go-bear type kind of defender? Where it gets tough for me is Matt
*  is Pizellas. Because there's been versions of him that have worked and there's been versions of him
*  that haven't worked. And I don't think the one thing I do like about him is that he's been,
*  had the spotlight on him the whole time. Right. And he's always been in the mix. There's always
*  been attention on him. He did play G league. Yeah. I could see the fronds thing, but we've also seen
*  those types of forwards where it's like, ah, they can kind of do everything, but not really anything.
*  Where do you stand on him, Kyle? The handle is going to be the big thing for me. Like he shows
*  flashes of like, he could be a spacer for you who like, he doesn't quite get to, he's not quite like
*  the horse getting to the rim like, like Franz was. Franz was just this powerful force getting into
*  the lane and could take contact. He's kind of got some of the, don't, don't cringe too much at this.
*  Like this is more just like where they are in their development. He's got kind of the
*  reddish Kevin Knoxy kind of thing going on with his dribble where when, when he takes contact,
*  he kind of like stops like he needs to, he's got to get low. But I believe in his handle more and
*  his feel way more than those two guys. So I'm not trying to like bring those two into the conversation.
*  But like, yeah, he's, the shooting is the big thing with him that people are worried about.
*  Like, you know, there are people who kind of like wonder, cause he had a really strong sample before
*  at a Sunrise Christian, which is a really reputable like factory for prospects. And he,
*  he had a good sample, but there are people who are kind of questioning that even now. It's kind of
*  like, well, what is it going to take for him to be consistent? Is it just that, you know, that G league
*  team was terrible as Kevin confronted Ron Holland with hilariously in that interview, I like spat
*  my drink out. You guys suck so much. They shut down the team. That affects the types of looks you can
*  get, you know, in a setting like that. Will that improve his sample? Will speeding up his shot?
*  Like he has a lot to work on. I think I'm a believer though. I really think that his feel
*  is going to sort of be the thing that gets him over the hump. And I think the shot is workable
*  enough. It's not broken. And yeah, it adds defense too. I think like the defensive versatility, the
*  especially off ball adds from protection. He's tough, hard nosed hustles. I think Buzellas has
*  enough of those kind of those qualities on top of the flashes of offensive potential that I give
*  him an edge over Sarr and Rissachet is kind of those mystery box prospects where you really don't
*  know what you're going to end up getting. And like you said, Kyle, the feel aspect, like he can handle
*  a little bit. He can pass a little bit, not as like a primary, not as like a point forward
*  necessarily, but he can do that with, I think in a good team context with other talented players,
*  he could be one of those connective pieces.
*  It's interesting that we lean positive on Buzellas, but negative on Rissachet though,
*  isn't it? That like they are similar. What is that about? What do you think the crux of that is?
*  I'm just throwing that for discussion because I think it's the handle. Like I think, I think
*  just think Buzellas shows more of that creation flashes, like pull up jumpers for mid range.
*  And he did it more at the high school level, whereas Rissachet has always been more of that
*  3 and D and hasn't expanded on the role. And maybe he just hasn't been able to show it. And
*  maybe in a different context he would have, but we haven't seen it. So Eileen Buzellas there.
*  It would be funny if KFC was like, I just don't trust the French after the Killian Hayes thing.
*  That's just where I am. It hurt my feelings. And that's just where I am now mentally.
*  All right. Rob Dillingham. So this has become my most fascinating YouTube guy.
*  There's a lot to love on the highlights. It's very possible his destiny might be 15 years from now,
*  somebody doing the three minute mixtape on whatever social platform we have in 2039.
*  And the headline is Rob Dillingham was a problem. That's one outcome.
*  There's another outcome where he's the rookie of the year and is just super fun. And people are
*  like, holy shit, who is this guy? He's like Jamal Crawford crossed with Kyrie.
*  I don't know what to make of the YouTube highlights, Kyle. I know you watched them all year,
*  but it's really hard for me to believe. A, that Shepard versus Dillingham is not more of an argument
*  for number three. If Houston's like, we want a guard, some scoring, which is some explosiveness.
*  I don't know why Dillingham's not in that conversation. And then just in general,
*  this guy's probably the most fun player in the draft. And should we be talking about him more?
*  So why aren't we talking about him more, Kyle, man?
*  I think it's, we've talked about this on the ringer NBA show on every show. It's just interesting
*  how, and I was telling you as like, I can't think of many instances over history, over my time
*  following the draft where there like, was a clear cut. Like Rob Dillingham is unequivocally the most
*  talented advantage creator in the draft. He's probably the most talented, just pure shot creator
*  in the draft. He's the most talented handler. He gets into the bat, into the, and the big thing,
*  big difference between him and Reed is Reed is very kind of, he doesn't get really low and wide
*  with his dribble. Rob is very low and wide with his dribble. And you mentioned Jamal Crawford.
*  It's kind of, to me, the thing is like, if we know those things are true, what's stopping us?
*  Well, it's like, well, what's stopping us? What stopped Malik Monk from being a primary option on
*  an NBA team? What stopped Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford? Like those guys, even today, we talked
*  about him, we're like, well, who would win in the one-on-one competition? You know, they're like,
*  well, Jamal Crawford would have been a problem, blah, blah, blah. But it's like, I think the worry
*  with him is the defense, similar. He's very small. He's very skinny. I think he weighed 170 pounds.
*  He would just kind of come and go. He could be a little like, he could be a little flighty at times
*  and make, you know, commit really, really timely, bad fouls. He was horrible about that. I was told
*  that was one of the big reasons they didn't keep him in the starting lineup as much. He just could
*  be a little bit erratic. But I agree with you. I mean, I think- So you don't think his coaching
*  at Donda Academy really established a good foundation? That's the other thing is, and Kevin,
*  you can speak to this from your intel stuff. Tate loves to talk about this. That's the other thing.
*  I almost forgot about that. He went to the Kanye school. Decision making.
*  He literally went to Kanye school. Decision making. Negative.
*  Yeah. So it's crazy. He really does have a lot of that. I mean, I've brought up the Garland thing
*  over and over again. Mainly it's just sort of like an engine for a discussion of why is it that,
*  I think he's a better athlete. He's a pretty explosive athlete. There were times where he did
*  windmills. He's a physical finisher around the basket. He's very quick and poppy.
*  What is it about? Why do we believe in Darius Garland so much and have skepticism in Rob
*  Dillingham? He's like a first ballot YouTube Hall of Fame prospect. He's so skilled.
*  KSC just goes by anybody whenever he wants. Finishes around the him. Kyrie's the best at this,
*  but there's definitely some Kyrie stuff with both hands. Has this crazy fun jump shot where he just
*  kicks his right foot out for no reason. It's kind of his trademark. I do feel like I could just see
*  him becoming a thing and then people imitating it. To me, the worst case scenario, Malik Monk has
*  more size than him. Not that he's a great defender either, but at least he's taller.
*  This kid, worst case scenario is probably a six man, but seems like an instant offense guy. If
*  it's in this draft where it's like, all right, I'm the Spurs and I'm picking eighth and I could get
*  this guy who just comes into games and swings games for six minutes of a quarter. That sounds
*  fantastic in a draft like this. Where do you stand on him? I got Dillingham tenth of my board, so I'd
*  be fine with him at eighth. I think Dillingham has that upside if he adds, I don't know, he waited at
*  164. So 164. Wow. Get this guy a cheeseburger. Really light. So if he gets up to 175. He's been
*  hurt, but you think maybe gain weight, but yeah. Yeah, but if he gets it up to 175, 180 at some
*  point and he's able to be surrounded by lengthy wing defenders where he's not a complete liability
*  on defense, I think he offers enough on offense. I mean, like you said, what's the difference between
*  him and Shepard like Kyle outlined at all? And I think the other thing is the passing. Dillingham
*  with, after he went to Donda Academy, he went to overtime elite and there he was score, score,
*  score, score. Like he's not much of a passer at all, more of a ball hog there. He passed more
*  with Kentucky, but he doesn't have that natural feel, quick decision making that Shepard has.
*  So Dillingham is more your bucket getter, your spark plug. And I like him for that. I do like
*  Dillingham, but with the lack of size and the lack of great feel as a passer or defense, he's 10 on
*  my board, not any higher than that. He goes against a lot of my instincts, Kyle. Like I'm really
*  fighting it off. It's the same reason I didn't like Isaiah Colley or from the get go. I just don't
*  usually like players like that, but there's some sort of flair with him that just feels a little
*  different. Like if you're going to say what rookie in this draft in the rookie season is a threat to
*  have like a 40 point game. Oh, easy. That's a given. I don't even think, is there anybody else you would
*  even connect? He might hit a 50. Yeah, connect can go well. We can talk about him, but like
*  Dillingham is going to score. He's going to have those nights. I mean, if you think about like the
*  Jalen Green kind of body type of like Dillingham does all that stuff, but he's more skilled and
*  efficient in every single way. Like it's the same elastic key kind of small guard thing, like,
*  but he did play pretty well with others. That's the other thing. They would have these three
*  guard lineups this past year where it was all pass, dribble, shoot, movement, kind of quick guards.
*  And he was not selfish. Like at any point, I never thought to myself, there were times where he took
*  one here or there, but like Cal supposedly gave him two a half. That's what he, but I mean, he
*  was efficient, man. I mean, like spot up three pointers, 54.5 as a pick and roll jump shooter
*  from three, he was 43% from three on 28 shots. But I mean, he can really shoot it. You know,
*  we talk, I feel like sometimes we say the shot maker thing as a way to like downplay maybe how
*  skilled they are, but he can really shoot it. Like, yeah, it would not surprise me at all.
*  We're going to have nights this upcoming like podcast cycle where we're like, Jesus, Rob
*  Dillingham and we'll question ourselves. I think the playoffs is a whole other thing, but yeah,
*  he's, he's just, if he were a little bigger, man, I think he'd be, would you say so Kevin? I mean,
*  if he were six, four, six, five, he'd be number one. He probably be number one. All right. Well,
*  that's it. It's going to start in Vegas and summer league. That's where it's going to begin
*  with the Rob Dillingham vibe because he's going to have some big nights. I'm already on Redfin
*  looking at looking at condos and Rob Dillingham Island. One thing about both of those Kentucky
*  guards that really stood out to me watching all this stuff is both of them really know how to use
*  picks already, which I got a comment on that. In the college game is just pretty rare for, you know,
*  it's just something that jumps out because that's all the pro game is, right? You're just,
*  somebody's coming out, you're trying to get mismatches and it seems like both of those guys
*  know how to do that. So I was thinking either of them on Houston next year with the kind of team
*  they clearly want to be competitive and they're going to be in real games.
*  Either of those guys I think could help them off the bench. What were you going to say, Kyle?
*  I was just going to say you, you noticed that and I think it says something about their skill
*  because this past year, the bigs that they were playing with were some of the most
*  incompetent screeners, bad timing, couldn't do any, like they, even the guys that could do something
*  with it would just make take stupid angles. Like it was the most maddening thing to watch from a
*  basketball and from a rooting perspective. So if you think about like a Dillingham with like,
*  let's say Miami gets crazy and they're just like, we want to just go get this guy. You were talking
*  about like, maybe there's not a star play for some of these teams that have something going in there.
*  Like, let's just go try to get this guy. Like if he's playing with like a bam or somebody that can
*  like lay the wood or like the way mom plays with Sabonis, it's going to be interesting to see
*  because they were playing, it was frustrating to watch a lot of the year.
*  Wasn't this a little like what was happening with Hero in that draft too?
*  Where people are like, oh, that guy can score, man.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, then he fell.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. KOC. Oklahoma City is at 12. This is going to be a weird draft with some mistakes
*  and it just feels like we're heading toward somebody sliding to okay. See it either 12
*  or maybe they look at Utah, the guys there at 10 and they move up. They do what they did last
*  year to get Wallace. Who's your slide guy? Because to me it's either, it's either Dillingham or
*  Holland. I could just see both of those guys going five spots later than they should, but
*  Dillingham especially, I feel like he's going to be gettable in the 10 to 14 range.
*  And Rossella said this when we were doing the pod the other day about stuff. Okay. See needed.
*  It would be fun for them to have just some heat check guard off the bench, like Dillingham, right?
*  Like they just coming off the bench with Dillingham and Wallace and they're like, watch this. And then
*  they're just, uh, you know, just building the offense around four minutes, but who's your
*  slide guy? Who do you think is going to fall? I mean, I think Dillingham and Holland, like you
*  mentioned two of them for sure. I think if you're talking about some of the top guys, you know,
*  top five ish guys, Buzellas maybe, you know, depending on how the board falls. I mean, he's
*  still in the Hawks worked him out on Sunday for number one. So we'll see there. Clinging,
*  dependent on the way the board falls. Like if Atlanta did go Reese's Shea, if Sarr did go to
*  the Wizards, if Shepherd went three to the Rockets and then if four was Buzellas and five ended up
*  not being Clinging, like it's a lot of those teams, five, six, seven, I disagree on that.
*  Cause I think this, I think 12, but to seven, like, no, but I think NFO QB rules are going to apply
*  with Clinging where he's such a commodity for this draft with certain teams that I think if he goes
*  maybe to five, that becomes a trade off at that point. But that's for okay. That's what I mean
*  for okay. See that is a trade off opportunity, right? Or Memphis, Memphis would be the other
*  one. Cause that rumor that's been going around the last couple of days about Marcus Smart and
*  number nine for number three, that that's stupid. Why would Memphis do that? They didn't offer it.
*  It's not going to be offered. That's a dumb trade. They're going to trade Marcus Smart to move up
*  six spots. Yeah. I said that, I said that to Verna just to make sure he doesn't, you know,
*  lose sleep before the night of the draft. I looked into it and let them know that Marcus
*  Smart and number nine are not going to three for to the Rockets. But that stupid Pistons team
*  that needs that basically has guys at every position, but needs everything.
*  If they could move back from five to 12 and pick up okay. See stuff. Oh yeah. And then okay. See,
*  he gets clinging out of it. Um, that's something I could see happening. I also think Memphis has
*  extra picks to trade to Detroit to me. Seems like the swing team and Charlotte's the other one,
*  Charlotte's at six. They kind of need every, Brandon Miller is probably the only keeper on
*  the team that you'd feel great about. I don't, do you guys feel like LaMelo is like a steadfast,
*  unquestionable keeper at this point? Cause I don't. I mean, what are you going to give
*  them up for though? That's my only question. My point is like having LaMelo wouldn't stop me
*  from taking Rob Dillingham if he was there at six, you know what I mean? I wouldn't take another
*  small forward. Cause I like Brandon Miller. He's, he's a guy. I don't love the Dillingham
*  Mello balance, but I do love disaster. I do, but I do. I do really love the shepherd LaMelo
*  balance though. You know, with that, with those two guys, high IQ guys,
*  clap passers connectors within, without the ball. And with Charlotte, I've heard that they are a
*  team like, you know, maybe they trade down, but there could be a trade up team as well.
*  If they were trading up for shepherd, I think that'd be the guy I'd want to move up for. If
*  I'm the Hornets to two or, or three, I mean, I'd love to have him. Cause he could work with
*  the Mello. If the Mello continues extending, like he did his last 10 or so games of last season
*  before he went out and got hurt. And if not, well, guess what? Shepherd's kind of insurance
*  for the Mello at the same time. He, he, he checks both of those boxes. So I think for Charlotte,
*  that'd be my dream target is Reed shepherd. And if not him, maybe Devon Carter, somebody like that,
*  Stefan Castle. I think there's like two, the one castle, Castle and Castle and Miller together
*  would be outrageous. So here's the thing with Charlotte Kyle, cause Charlotte is, I wouldn't
*  say they've been competent for this entire century. New ownership. I would say pick a time
*  when they were, you might be faster. They hit the Brandon Miller pick and the Charles Lee coach
*  higher. The Celtics love Charles Lee. Like that guy's going to be a good coach. The Celtics were
*  like, could not have been more bummed out that he got a head coach job, but we're also excited
*  about it. But that whole process of how they landed on him, they identified him fast. They grabbed
*  them. They got him. Charlotte might actually know what they're doing. So I think the old version of
*  Charlotte probably takes Rob Dillingham and then him and Lambello are feuding by like game 40.
*  This version, I'm kind of excited to, to, to see what they do for that. Did you, who did you have
*  as your slide guy, Kyle? I think, I mean, I think Dillingham is going to slide for sure. I don't,
*  you know, you mentioned, you mentioned Klingon, somebody's going to grab him. I could see Buzelle
*  is falling. Um, among those guys, just, just not necessarily because people just sometimes guys just
*  fall because not because they were, I guess that's not even true. But I mean, if you're looking at
*  like Detroit and Charlotte, I just think they're both in kind of a situation where you're like,
*  okay, the rebuilds have been bad, especially with Detroit. They have new leadership, Charlotte,
*  new ownership. You're kind of like, you can either go like, we're going to rip this out,
*  root and stem for me. If I was Charlotte, I think Mark Williams is worth keeping around.
*  I think they've got a couple things to keep around. Yeah, I think he'll work, but I just think they
*  run into an issue too, where it's like, if you keep drafting these like dribble pull up guys who
*  don't put a lot of pressure on the rim, like, like Lambello and Reed and Miller would be really fun,
*  but I just think you'd have to, a have really, really good defensive front court on the other
*  end. And you'd have to have, I like, I like cat. They need culture reset too. I think both of those
*  teams do. And I mean, you guys, you know, be a good move, KSC, you know, be a good move. They take,
*  they take Castle at six, which I don't even think he'll be there, but if they could get them and
*  then they're like Castle and Miller, this is our version of Brown and Tatum. We're going to build
*  around these guys. Just good message. Brown and Tatum just won the title. We'd like to emulate
*  the Boston Celtics, our 2024 world champions. This is a good start for us. Yeah, I, I'm with you.
*  They would have taken the Rando ball crater. All right. Let's talk about the most fun guy in the
*  draft. Not from a basketball standpoint, but just from a where the fuck is it going to go standpoint,
*  Zach Edie. You could tell me he goes ninth. You could tell me he goes 25th. I'm prepared for
*  anything. I am. I'm not going to have a lot of hardcore draft takes, but this one I'm going to
*  etch in stone for you guys. I think Zach Edie is a rotation guy in the NBA. And I think he should be
*  a top 15 pick. Let's go. Yeah. And I think he will absolutely be able to play in a playoff series.
*  I just think like, okay, see at number 12 would be so much fun. If that was the location for him
*  where look, he, let's say he's playing 14 minutes a game, but it's just like, he's a just, let's get
*  weird guy where it's like, Oh, we're doing this now. Look at this. And you think about what the
*  playoffs we just watched, there's all these situations where sometimes teams are too small,
*  you know, like the Knicks, like they lose, they lose Mitchell Robinson. All of a sudden they're
*  playing precious at center. Well, guess what? You're not going to be able to do that again.
*  Zach Edie. And maybe you'll torch him on the other end and you'll put them in screens and all that
*  stuff. But there's just a lot to like with the dude he produced at a crazy level. I even like the
*  fact that he's a good free throw shooter. I like the fact that at the end of games, you can put
*  him in games and just inbound it to him and he'll get fouled and he'll make both free throws.
*  He's something he's like a seven. If he's a seventh man, eighth man on a playoff team,
*  that's pretty great in a draft. So I am, I'm pro Zach Edie. I do not think he should go past 15.
*  And honestly, if he's there at 12, I wouldn't be surprised if okay. So he took them. That is my
*  Zach Edie speech. What do you think Kyle, man? I've been, I went on a thunder podcast and said
*  this that like, I think there's been a swell of people supporting this idea because yeah,
*  because because I think if you're Oklahoma city, I don't think that you're missing piece,
*  you know, they traded for Caruso, but I don't think that you're missing piece to like shore up that
*  like four, three spot where you need some more size to like guard those bigger forwards. I don't
*  think that you're going to get that. Well, I don't think that you should even, even if you were,
*  I don't think that you should add another guy on the same timeline as that, that core. Like I think
*  that like Edie is just interesting because you know, they, I don't think that it would
*  compromise the way that they play with their five out style, like the main thing they do.
*  Like, so I wouldn't think about it that way. I would just think about it. Like let's say they're
*  in a playoff series against like the sons and in comes the second unit and you're like, okay,
*  I don't know who's even going to be there. Kevin, who's going to be there back up five next year.
*  It's not going to be somebody, right? Somebody bad somebody. And then you're just like, okay,
*  well our guy just picked up three or four fouls because Edie just, he's just a machine. He's
*  super physical. He, I told you, he shoots like 70% on that, like righty hook. And that was like
*  all of his offense. You can get a little turned off by like how simple it is, but I think that like
*  he gets the line. He's a foul machine. He catches lobs. I just think he's an interesting novel
*  thing to have on your bench because I can't really think of a comparison. Like I can't think of a guy
*  that was that big and that had that much of an effective way that he scores like in the past.
*  Uh, I don't know. Can you all think of a big that was similar to him that was that effective?
*  You know what I thought of one of the doubt and Dallas, the Quippers went away from this in the
*  Dallas series, but one of the things they tried to do early in the series was they had Zubots and
*  they're like, we think Zubots can bully ball Gafford and lively and they would go to him and
*  he was actually scoring in them in the low post. And I was watching it going, man, nobody does this
*  anymore. And just says, fuck you. We're going to post up our center and try to Dallas, try to do
*  this with Gafford against Tatum a couple of times. But for the most part, you just think about the
*  finals, how many teams went small or tried to get away with, you know, like trying to play five out,
*  like the Celtics data or try to cheat five, 10 minutes stretches. And I just don't think you're
*  going to be able to do that against Edie. Like whether he's not going to, I don't think he's
*  going to be an all NBA guy. I don't think he's being all star, but I think he's going to be a
*  fucking bitch against certain teams. I think he's be really hard to guard. Where do you stand?
*  I mean, minutes after OKC got eliminated, I posted how they should draft Zach Edie.
*  So I've been, okay. So you, so we're all buying a condo together and Zach Edie. I mean, I already
*  purchased multiple, honestly. I mean, I think if Edie goes to OKC, I think he has a chance to be
*  one of the five best guys from the draft class. And it's because of everything. Memphis.
*  I don't think Memphis is going to take Edie. I think Memphis wants to play fast. I don't think
*  they want, I think they want maybe more of like a Klingon space. They want to aware even for that
*  matter to Kaleleware would be interesting there. And so would Klingon if they trade up. But Edie
*  for OKC specifically and other teams too. But with the Thunder, like if he's there, change of pace
*  guy for 15 minutes a game in some series and maybe 30 minutes a game in some other series.
*  Because the thing with Edie is even though he's massive, he's durable. He played almost every
*  minute in the tournament for Purdue all the way to the title game. He is relentless. He has great
*  energy. And the thing people talk about with his defense, I mentioned this play all the time,
*  but the block he had on Dalton Connect, the end of the Purdue Tennessee game where he just
*  outstretched his arm and made this nasty block on Connect going for an extension layup.
*  Purdue had Edie avoid fouls. They wanted him just to use his sheer size to be a deterrent around the
*  rim. They didn't want him going for blocks. They didn't want him getting into foul trouble because
*  if he was, they're dead. OK, so that moment against Connect, I think serves as an example
*  of what he could be if he has Chet Holmgren on the wing next to him, if he's on the Lakers and
*  Anthony Davis is next to him. If it's the Heat with Bam Adebayo out there, if it's a too big system.
*  The Heat's another one that I really like for him. Yeah. I think Edie could be nasty in the
*  offense that he brings. And also, like you said, Bill, good free throw shooter. He's got touch,
*  as you said, Kyle, 70 percent or whatever it is on that right hook shot. He has touch.
*  And there's a lot of people that believe he can develop like a Brooke Lopez-esque
*  34, 35 percent spot-off three-point shot. And if that happens with Edie, well, that changes
*  everything with the way we talk about him as a future pro in the NBA. He's also a funny
*  Philadelphia 76ers pick at 16, too. That no break. Just like no insurance. But also like when it
*  indeed comes out, this guy comes in. That's interesting. I hadn't thought about that one before.
*  I wonder if Sacramento 13. Now they have the same issues as Memphis where they want to play fast.
*  They want to play a little spread shoot, run and gun and all that. But that would also be a fun
*  guy for them. I just think I think he'd be fun for a lot of these teams where you think about
*  like if Miami takes him. Now the Celtics are playing Miami. Poor Zingas is out. He hasn't
*  recovered from his injury. And they're playing like Luke Cornett. And it's like,
*  oh, Zach Edie's in. Oh, my God, he's torching Luke Cornett. It's like, Jesus, he just scored
*  eight points in two minutes. I like that he took a lot of shit as a college player, too. I feel like
*  he comes in the NBA with thick skin, which some of these dudes, like the guys from Kentucky,
*  they were in college basketball for like five minutes and they're in the draft. Zach Edie was
*  in there for a while playing big games in front of big crowds with a spotlight on him. So yeah,
*  I'm kind of in on him. What do you do about toe pitch coming off the torn ACL where it's like on
*  the one hand, there's value for him. And on the other hand, you don't have a guy for a year. And
*  then his first year, he's coming off in knee surgery. So maybe you lose two years, but he's
*  somebody that people thought could potentially be a top eight pick. What's the right range for him,
*  Kyle? I think that he's a fair bet. Like if you're, you know, this has happened before where guys
*  come in, people get a little turned off. Well, they've been turned off by the shooting. I mean,
*  that's a thing. Like he hasn't been a consistent pull up shooter in the way that you would like,
*  which would like unlock a lot of his stuff. I think in the like 10 to 15 range, I think he'd
*  be a fair bet because he's in the like, or maybe even higher. I mean, it depends on your belief in
*  his because among like the pick and roll playmakers in the draft, I have him as like the top three.
*  Like he's right in there. Like his, his spatial sense, like, and he's young, like, you know,
*  people have talked about him in Jurisdic a whole lot and Nicola Jurisdic a lot. And he's, he's a
*  year younger than him. And he just made Kevin and I talked about it on our show that like, he knows
*  how to make every pass, like skip passes, roller passes. And he was playing with grown men. So I
*  think, you know, if you're looking for somebody who's just like, you know, a second side, catch
*  it and like run another pick and roll his level of decision making is really high, I think. But
*  the shooting, the shootings, the thing, I think, you know, depending on, I think your, your
*  willingness to move higher, I think is probably driven by that.
*  And it's also KOC, a fun tank pick, right? If you're Portland at 14, it's like, yeah, let's take the
*  guy who can't play for a year anyway. We want to suck next year. They pre injured. Yeah. He's
*  pre injured. He won't hang over. It's like the old Philly move where it's like they're in the process
*  when they're just drafting dudes who probably can't play for them. Where do you have them?
*  I have them at 15 on my board in part because the injury knocking him down a bit. And like Kyle said,
*  the shooting, he shot 30% from three this past season. He's like a good bet, I think, to figure
*  it out as a shooter. He's an 80 plus percent guy from the free throw range. He's got good touch on,
*  you know, a little floater shots near the rim, but he's stiff. Like I think mechanically, he
*  needs to change his shot. I don't think it's a matter of just like getting stronger or getting
*  confidence or whatever. That's, you know, that those qualities, I think it's more about he needs
*  to change his mechanics a bit from three point range. I could splash a little if you wanted to
*  be confident. He has awesome rhythm as a ball handler. We talked about this earlier in the year
*  that like he just has a nice kind of like movement to the, like you said, he is stiff and like when
*  he gets into a shot, but when you move like that, I think you can be coached to sort of like harness
*  sort of like the energy in the way that you move. Like he's not shooting from sort of like this
*  mechanical stiff way. Like I think that his handle can flow into a nice shot. Like I think
*  it's workable in that way. Have you heard his Andre the giant voice? Oh my God. Yeah. He's got
*  like the deepest, deepest NBA draft voice in like 10 years. He's like, bro, does that move his stock
*  up though? I like that. All right guys, before we wrap, it's time for the most exciting moment
*  of the podcast. As you know, the Celtics have the 30th pick.
*  And as you know, I dive into college basketball. I dive into this whole draft process only having
*  watched NCAA tournament games and YouTube. And yet I have a guy that I want for the Celtics at number
*  30 and he might not be there, but I, so I have a backup pick too. I've hinted at you got with you
*  guys who I wanted here. So it's not going to be too surprising, but our winner is Baylor
*  Shireman. That's why I won number 30. Just shooter. I could see him on the team. I think he'd fit in
*  from a chemistry standpoint, gives us a little Sam Hauser insurance down the road. If Sam Hauser
*  leaves, maybe he could come in and just get some three point buckets for us, but he's older. I want
*  the Celtics take an older guy who could act because the second apron thing, they're going
*  to be freaking playing the trainer is like the ninth man. They're going to have no money for anybody.
*  He's 23.7 years old. According to the ringer draft guide, sounds great. He's almost at his mid 20s
*  and his prime. Yeah. And that's my pick. So when we get, when we get to like the early 20s,
*  I'm going to be on Baylor Shireman watch, hoping nobody takes him. KOC your thoughts.
*  I think Shireman would be a great fit at 30. He makes perfect, perfect sense for the Celtics.
*  If he makes it there, I'm interested in why you prefer an older guy instead of like an upside
*  swing at 30 when the rotation is already set for at least next season. Like, like doesn't party.
*  You want to take like an 18 or 19 year old guy that in two years. No, no, no.
*  The answer is no. There's a dynasty on the main Celtics right now. Here's the track record with
*  that. And here's why that doesn't work. Those guys are not going to play for the first two years of
*  their career. Right. So even by the time they start playing, it's now year three, maybe year four.
*  And the guys 22, 23, you have no idea if he's good because you've had no arc with him because
*  he's been buried just playing G league. And then you have to decide on his second, second contract.
*  You're like, I've seen this guy played never. Um, I think what Miami did with Hawkeyes,
*  that's the direction. If you're a really good team, I think you have to think that way. You
*  have to look at these guys 22, 23, 24. I'm, I'm sure like, uh, the, the golden state,
*  like the fact that they were able to get guys last year, you know, little different example,
*  but guys who could play right away for the team they had made sense. Whereas like the Lakers
*  took project guys who couldn't get on the floor. And if they had to do it over again,
*  they obviously would have taken Hawkeyes, but I want to,
*  Denver, Denver Christian Brown, even last year, Julian Strother, even though he didn't play much
*  Jalen Pickett and Hunter Tyson, all older guys. I want older guys. So that's my first pick.
*  Kyle, you have any, uh, Baylor thoughts before I move on? I was going to say you didn't exactly
*  hint at it as much as outright endorsement. It was sort of, didn't you have like exclamation points?
*  Yeah. He was, he jumped out immediately. KSC had in the draft guide shades of big Brandon
*  Pudzemsky. That sounds great. I'm all in on that. Um, my other one, this is a deep cut
*  and weirdly he was floating around on NBA draft tour yesterday because there was this video of him,
*  um, breaking down plays, but, uh, I like the, I like the Marquette
*  kind of forward center guy. Also a good Darrow. He is 21.9 years old. KFC gave him the shades of Al
*  Horford, even though he had him as the 47th ranked guy in a terrible draft colleges to Al.
*  No, that's where I should change it to average Al Horford.
*  Average. You need an adjective in there.
*  But this is another guy that makes sense with the way the league is, right? He's a big guy
*  and everybody's like, he's a really good passer. Well, it's like, well, what do big guys do on
*  teams like this? They're 25, 20 feet from the lane, they're setting screens and they're just
*  trying to find people, Derek Lively style. And, uh, I think that would be a fun one too. Is 32
*  early for him? It probably is.
*  He's funny. He's, he's fun. There's some caveats. Like he's a little skinny. He's not quite,
*  you want him to be like a Capella type. Like if he were a little bigger, you'd feel bad.
*  Better about playing small with him. But like if he gets up against some legit bigs that are
*  putting him in the basket, it could be an issue. I was going to say like there are a couple of like,
*  you know, Devin Carter won't be there. Obviously Harrison Ingram is a guy from North Carolina
*  that I like a lot. That is extremely toolsy. They can like hit shots that I think if he worked on
*  his body could, could adjust to the way the Celtics play. Kevin knows what's getting ready to come
*  next. Kevin McCuller, my guy from Kansas. He's the guy who's that's he's been one of my favorite
*  players in the draft. I think he owes me a paycheck at this point. I've mentioned him so
*  many times, but he's a weird one. Cause cause he had the injury and then he's been being a little,
*  he just might go what 12, 15 spots later than he should have. I studied his tapes too. Yeah.
*  I wasn't, I wasn't as, I was just trying to figure out guys who could fit with the team. Like I think
*  in 2008 they would have taken Isaiah Coller and be like, can't believe he fell to 30. And then he's
*  just getting waved in two years. Is there anybody else KFC? Can I give you one young guy,
*  one teenage prospect to think about? Like an 18 year old, 19 year old? Yeah. French prospect
*  played this last season in Germany, Pecome, that DA. This is, they worked him out the morning after
*  they won the championship. Pecome is a guy who fits in terms of he can dribble, he can shoot,
*  he can pass, he has defensive versatility with a six nine wingspan. So even though Pecome is younger
*  with a six, you know, he's younger, he's 18 years old right now. He's not going to play right away.
*  If there's one, if yes, if there's one young guy that I think makes sense for Boston at number 30,
*  it'd be him. I would agree taking the Denver Golden state route with an older guy is the preferable
*  path considering all the implications with the second April. That, that is the route,
*  but if they go young, I think Pecome, the DA is the guy they should really think about at number 30.
*  My last thing, my last draft take, which you've heard before, so I saved it for the end because
*  it's boring, but the audience hasn't really heard it. I'm, I'm all in on Jared McCain.
*  Yeah. And he's going to probably fall to Miami at number 15 and people are going to beg,
*  oh, that's a good pick. And I'm just going to fucking start breaking shit. I'm going to be
*  so mad if Miami takes him and then I'm going to be equally mad if Philadelphia takes him.
*  I don't want him to go to Miami or Philadelphia because Jared McCain is going to be good.
*  I will go on the record with that. You can take this video, you can cut it. You can throw it back
*  in my face four years from now. I'm going to be right. Jared McCain, that guy has been a winner
*  his entire life. He's a winning basketball player. He's going to just figure it out and be a good
*  guard who will be on good teams. And you watch that's my Jared McCain case. I love Jared McCain.
*  Did you listen to my interview with him that like helped like win me over even more than I already
*  won over? He's been leading men for a while, right? And he's played out here and I
*  got to watch him in LA a bunch and I just think that dude has it. And I was thinking about him
*  for Utah at 10. Next to Keonte George in the back court. That's interesting. Yeah. And just like he's
*  even though he's young, he'll eventually be like the adult. He's just, he's going to be a good pro.
*  He knows what to do and how to act and how to, and he's a guy, Trent Perry is like this too,
*  who's going to colleges here, but these guys who know how to get everyone else involved and then
*  take over in the last four minutes. Like he knows how to do that. So, all right, contractually,
*  I have to ask you where you think Brian is going to get drafted before we go. Where do you think Kyle?
*  I mean, it seems like 55. I don't know. Is the sun's going to try to like make a play to get
*  involved in this, to get aggressive and maybe become more involved than they actually are. I
*  mean, it's, it seems like 55, even though it's consensus, it's feels like the safe bet.
*  What do you think, Kelsey? I think I'll be conservative here and say Lakers are 55.
*  I think he goes in the thirties and I think it's by a team that feels like they can bluff the Lakers
*  and they're thinking they're going to take them trying to get assets from him and the Lakers will
*  panic because this is clearly all been preordained. That's my prediction. Honestly, my favorite idea is,
*  you're bit recently, the Celtics, just as a trade asset. So I liked that idea more last week until I
*  was able to finally really be able to dive into the draft. I was like, man, we might actually get
*  somebody who could be a 10th man at number 30. But I do think as a trade asset, you know,
*  Rossella laid out some of that Rich Paul interview the other day where he's like,
*  if we wanted him to take him at 17, we would just tell the Lakers take him at 17. It's like, whoa.
*  Okay. Yeah. I think he goes in the thirties by a team that doesn't really want the pick
*  and just feels like they can get something.
*  Pacers have three second round draft picks. They draft 36. I think they'd be a good candidate
*  for exactly what you're talking about. Yeah.
