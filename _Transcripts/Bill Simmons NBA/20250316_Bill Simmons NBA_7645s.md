# Phoenix in Shambles, Cleveland’s Ceiling and More! With Ryen Russillo | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A)
*  All right, we are taping this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=0.0s)]
*  It is four o'clock on a Sunday afternoon. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1.28s)]
*  All the March Madness stuff just came out. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4.08s)]
*  Our long national nightmare is over. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6.12s)]
*  Another Phoenix Suns nationally televised game is behind us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7.84s)]
*  How much longer, Rosillo? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=11.88s)]
*  How much, like, here's the case for the season being too long. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  We don't have to go through the death march [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=16.32s)]
*  of the last 20 Suns games, among other things. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=18.48s)]
*  But God, can't they move stuff around? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=20.96s)]
*  Can't they flex? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=22.8s)]
*  What can they do? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=23.64s)]
*  At one point, Wisconsin had outscored Phoenix [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=24.96s)]
*  through like 24 minutes of real basketball. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=27.36s)]
*  I was keeping track of it, you know? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=29.76s)]
*  And rarely will I ever be at home going, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  when does Atlanta-Brooklyn start? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=33.6s)]
*  Because that's where I was with them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=35.88s)]
*  And I know they kind of pretended it was close. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Bill, they fuck up on defense so many times that I can't even... [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=40.6s)]
*  Sometimes I can't figure out who was wrong. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=43.68s)]
*  Yeah, there's too many suspects. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=46.92s)]
*  Yeah, like I'll have these plays written down [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  and be like, what happened on that one? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=50.92s)]
*  And then at the very end, there's a... [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  I think it's a Dorian Finney-Smith three, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=54.8s)]
*  where it looked like youth league basketball [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=56.68s)]
*  where three guys were on Luka. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  And they don't... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=61.6s)]
*  I just, I hate watching them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=63.76s)]
*  I've obviously expressed that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=65.56s)]
*  We don't need to spend a lot of time on this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=66.76s)]
*  They hate having you watch them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=68.8s)]
*  They hate playing together. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=71.88s)]
*  They hate watching each other [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=73.48s)]
*  as they play basketball together. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  It's a pretty rare situation of a team [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=76.56s)]
*  that seems reasonably talented on paper, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=79.32s)]
*  that we have these teams that bring the best [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=81.84s)]
*  out of each other, and this team just brings [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=83.64s)]
*  the worst out of each other for whatever reason. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=85.16s)]
*  I have no answer for it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=87.88s)]
*  I was gonna have a little segment for you later. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=88.72s)]
*  It should never be this bad. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=90.08s)]
*  It should never be this bad. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  As bad as they are, people can make fun of it or whatever. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=92.84s)]
*  It's ridiculous they're this bad. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=95.2s)]
*  Like coming out of the gate, you would think you have [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=97.88s)]
*  between 52 and 56 points per game from two guys. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=99.92s)]
*  You should be in every game at that point, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=105.16s)]
*  no matter how bad your defense is, whatever you're missing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=106.72s)]
*  You should at least be hanging around. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=108.88s)]
*  They're down 10, 15, 20. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  Nobody seems to care. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=113.6s)]
*  I was gonna do a little segment later, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=115.92s)]
*  but we can do it now called I Just Don't Have the Answer. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  And if I had a son's friend who was like, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=121.28s)]
*  what do you think's wrong with this team? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=124.72s)]
*  And I was like, I honestly don't know. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  I don't know why it's even worse than it was last year [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=129.08s)]
*  when it was like, oh, it's Vogel's fault. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=131.52s)]
*  Maybe it's Nurkic's fault. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=133.72s)]
*  Well, they traded Nurkic. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=136.16s)]
*  It's still bad. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=137.28s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=138.12s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=139.56s)]
*  Last year, remember they had that ridiculous [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=140.4s)]
*  fourth quarter point differential that was so absurd. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=142.28s)]
*  It was historically bad, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=144.52s)]
*  and it still didn't really make any sense [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=145.56s)]
*  because you're like, well, it can't actually be that bad. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=147.0s)]
*  And then there was an injury part of it [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  where you could point to how often [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  have you had the three guys there. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  And this year, you can't point to any of that stuff. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=155.56s)]
*  And it's like, look, I actually probably watch them [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=158.72s)]
*  more than I should because I'm still amazed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=162.0s)]
*  And I'm not talking about them [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=166.36s)]
*  not being like a four-seater or whatever, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  but this team sucks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=168.84s)]
*  And even when they had that winning streak, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  which we've talked about in the past, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=172.4s)]
*  they had that stretch, but they'd lost to Charlotte [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=173.6s)]
*  and they barely beat Charlotte [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=176.2s)]
*  and they had a weird Wizards game that they almost blew [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=177.4s)]
*  and they were putting together a decent record. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  And even then I'm like, I don't like this team at all. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=181.84s)]
*  And I think a lot of it's just the defensive effort, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=184.76s)]
*  the lack of competitiveness, the point of attack defense, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=187.68s)]
*  whatever their help rules are, they don't know what they are. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=191.04s)]
*  They don't care to know what they are. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=193.68s)]
*  They're just an absolute mess. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=196.0s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=198.32s)]
*  People can point to this and be like, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=199.4s)]
*  oh, this is why you shouldn't do this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  or you shouldn't do that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=201.68s)]
*  Teams are never gonna say, oh, you know what we're gonna do? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=202.56s)]
*  Not bring in stars because of what happened at Phoenix. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  But this is so bad. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  I actually do think it's more than just, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=210.52s)]
*  when the nets were messed up, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=212.96s)]
*  those guys didn't really play or they were hurt. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  It was Durant, Kyrie, and obviously Harden, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=217.12s)]
*  and then the Simmons part of it's a different factor [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=219.72s)]
*  altogether, but I watch in amazement, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=221.8s)]
*  but I think I'm done after today. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know what else is funny when they're on [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  on the same night where there's an awesome game? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=229.16000000000003s)]
*  If you watch them after you watch Celtics thunder [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=232.6s)]
*  the other night, and how hard everybody's going, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=235.08s)]
*  every possession and the switching and the scrambling [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=237.68s)]
*  and the intensity and the aggressiveness, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  and then you watch the Suns, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=243.4s)]
*  basically playing like it's an all-star game. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=245.28s)]
*  There was an article on ESPN on Friday, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  where it was kind of, it wasn't a now they tell us [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=251.8s)]
*  because the season's still going, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  but there was some breadcrumbs strewn throughout, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=255.84s)]
*  including some good Ishby quotes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=259.64s)]
*  There's a hilarious Bradley Beale quote about, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=261.24s)]
*  I've got my no trade clause, I'm doing great. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=262.92s)]
*  But reading that piece, they're basically saying, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=266.24s)]
*  look, Ishby is going Booker's an untouchable. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=269.88s)]
*  That's the one guy, he's basically saying [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=273.12s)]
*  we're trading Durant in the summer, which everybody knows. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=275.32s)]
*  I don't think anybody should be an untouchable [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  on this team. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  The way the last three years have gone, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=279.52s)]
*  the two of us were in a room, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=282.88s)]
*  we were the conciliaries for Ishby, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=284.0s)]
*  and he's like, well, we can't trade Booker. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=285.44s)]
*  I would be like, we can't? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=289.76s)]
*  Everybody's available, in my opinion, on that team. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=292.04s)]
*  I know they're gonna build around Booker, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=294.48s)]
*  but from what we've seen from him, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=296.0s)]
*  the last couple of playoffs, and then this season, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=297.8s)]
*  and last season too, I just don't feel like [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=299.88s)]
*  there's an untouchable guy on this team. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=301.76s)]
*  If the Rockets were gonna overpay for Booker, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=303.68s)]
*  I would just think about it at least. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=306.56s)]
*  I wouldn't just say blanket, no way, we're not trading him. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=308.6s)]
*  You like Booker more than I do, though. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=311.68s)]
*  I do, I do. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=313.88s)]
*  Today was a bad shooting game, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=316.96s)]
*  and I've watched him in so many of these stretches [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  in the fourth quarter where he starts the fourth by himself [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=321.24s)]
*  with whatever role guys, they're trying to mix [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  and match with him, and whatever his efficiency [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=325.92s)]
*  is supposed to be in those moments, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=328.92s)]
*  I mean, it's just shot to hell, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  because there's no spacing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  Remember when Ryan Dunn hit threes for a couple weeks, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=334.56s)]
*  and everybody was like, how did this guy, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=336.76000000000005s)]
*  how did he last so late? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=337.92s)]
*  And then every scout was like, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=339.48s)]
*  Book is a year? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  Because he can't shoot, and guess what? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=341.16s)]
*  He can't shoot. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  The Nick Richards thing, moving out, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  Nurkic was supposed to help a little bit. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=345.88000000000005s)]
*  We've covered all the stuff where I felt like [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  with their restrictions, they actually did a really good job [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=350.28s)]
*  on the margins of all of this stuff. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=351.56s)]
*  I mean, you can sit here and keep blaming Beale [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=353.4s)]
*  for all of it, but at some point, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=355.08s)]
*  like Booker and Durant just have to move on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=356.32s)]
*  from the fact that Beale's not available, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=358.48s)]
*  he's not competitive. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=360.04s)]
*  I don't know that he's as prideful as you need [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=362.08s)]
*  to be from a guy that's getting paid that much money, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=364.4s)]
*  and maybe we had all the hints when he was with the Wizards, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=366.4s)]
*  and it's funny, we get on these guys' cases [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=368.6s)]
*  about asking out of situations sometimes, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=370.92s)]
*  and not every case is the same, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=373.24s)]
*  so I don't think you should be married to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=374.64s)]
*  every player is wrong or every player is right, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=376.6s)]
*  which other people, you can find them doing that, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=378.8s)]
*  but should we have known when Beale was like, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=381.52s)]
*  oh, I'm good in Washington? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=383.44s)]
*  Right, this is great. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=385.8s)]
*  Was that the old-time glue? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=387.48s)]
*  If you were Booker, why would you want to stay? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=390.48s)]
*  I don't know, because Ishbia's quotes, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=394.2s)]
*  I understand where he's coming from, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=396.56s)]
*  but you can't just grit your teeth [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=399.08s)]
*  and be better in the NBA. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=402.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=404.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=405.96s)]
*  It's like, we're not gonna tank, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=406.8s)]
*  we have too much pride to do that, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  so we're going plan B, and not everybody [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=410.32s)]
*  thinks that they should do plan B, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  but that's what we're gonna do. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=413.76s)]
*  It's like, okay, cool, you have no draft picks, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=414.92s)]
*  you have no way to improve your roster, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  you're not gonna be able to sign free agents, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=419.16s)]
*  you're over the apron, you're not gonna get [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  nearly what you think you're gonna get for Durant, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  you're just not, he's gonna be in year 19 next year, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  and he's not as impactful two ways as he used to be, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=428.08s)]
*  and if anything, I would think he's a pretty big [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=431.2s)]
*  injury risk at the age he's at. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=433.48s)]
*  I just don't think people are pwning up [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  big packages for him. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  Who's doing it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=439.16s)]
*  We go through teams right now, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  find me the team that's gonna be like, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=442.36s)]
*  yeah, Durant, right now. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=443.92s)]
*  First of all, somebody will do it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=446.20000000000005s)]
*  What is it though? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  Like, let's say Miami strikes out an off free agent, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=448.8s)]
*  so like, all right, let's go for KD. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=451.36s)]
*  What's the offer? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=454.48s)]
*  Like, two years ago. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=456.20000000000005s)]
*  Miami? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but it's the kind of team like that, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=458.72s)]
*  it's like a semi-desperate team. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=460.92s)]
*  There's other teams that I think, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=463.04s)]
*  with what you've seen from Durant the last couple years [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=465.12s)]
*  with how unhappy his teams are, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  and I should mention, I like Kevin Durant. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=468.44s)]
*  He's been on a lot of unhappy teams now in the 2020s. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=470.72s)]
*  I would be scared if I had a young team. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=473.44s)]
*  Like, let's bring in this guy as the widely leadership vet. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=475.76000000000005s)]
*  Like, can you do that? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=479.72s)]
*  All right, so I wrote some things down, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=482.88s)]
*  so if we're just in it now, let's get to it, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=485.04s)]
*  because last year when we were watching Dallas [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=487.04s)]
*  and the Clippers play in that playoff series, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=489.64000000000004s)]
*  and we were talking, and it was kind of like a fun series, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=491.76000000000005s)]
*  and it was also weird, and it was just, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=495.28s)]
*  you didn't really know what to expect. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=497.12s)]
*  Kawhi goes down, and Dallas gets through it, whatever, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=498.4s)]
*  and you've got all these guys out there [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=501.0s)]
*  where it's like, clearly you would do anything to get Kawhi, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=502.96s)]
*  and then you double down on all of it to get Paul George, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=505.4s)]
*  because Paul George gets you Kawhi, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=507.84s)]
*  and we've been over it with Lawrence Frank and Balmer, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=509.48s)]
*  and in the moment, you'd be like, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=511.64s)]
*  hey, we can get Kawhi if we move in for Paul George. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=513.68s)]
*  It's like, all right, done, what are we doing? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=516.24s)]
*  And then they make the hardened deal, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=518.28s)]
*  and they're like the only team that's gonna pay him. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=520.52s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=522.76s)]
*  I hated it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=525.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay, but on the Dallas side, you have the Kyrie bet, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=526.0s)]
*  which at the time. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=529.84s)]
*  Hated that too. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=531.1600000000001s)]
*  Right, here's a cool one. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=532.0s)]
*  One of these guys, you wanna talk about breadcrumbs [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=533.48s)]
*  to clues for Niko Harrison later on, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=535.7600000000001s)]
*  who also, after the Luka trade, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=539.7600000000001s)]
*  said that they don't do scary transactions. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=541.2s)]
*  It's like you actually did the scariest transaction [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  that you could've done in the league at the time, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  and it's been awesome. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=547.08s)]
*  Kyrie's been awesome for them, it sucks he's hurt, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  because it's just been fun to see him be kind of happy [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=550.12s)]
*  as a basketball player again. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=551.84s)]
*  Anyway, so the point is, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  we were talking about that series, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=553.76s)]
*  I'm like this series is an example of why GMs are just like, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=555.72s)]
*  yeah, I know what all you guys are saying, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=558.64s)]
*  but in the playoffs, we need dudes that are at that level [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=560.48s)]
*  that can find a way to get buckets. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=563.72s)]
*  And I think the Jimmy Butler lesson is another reminder [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=565.24s)]
*  of think about his market, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=568.24s)]
*  think about how much we talk about it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=569.72s)]
*  All of us that aren't working in leagues, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=571.6s)]
*  and then all of a sudden it's like Golden State's like, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=573.8s)]
*  yeah, we'll do something for it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=575.48s)]
*  They didn't give up a ton, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=576.52s)]
*  but then we'll also throw 100 million at this guy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=577.6s)]
*  And it's worked, and it's been great, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  but I think there are constant reminders [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=582.44s)]
*  as we talk about Durant, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  for however down we can think everyone is [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=585.8800000000001s)]
*  on one of these players, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=589.24s)]
*  these guys that are all gonna go to the Hall of Fame, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  and granted there's an age where it's no longer worth it, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=593.48s)]
*  but Durant's still probably in the window [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  where another team goes, you know what, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=597.32s)]
*  maybe we're a 48 to 52 win team, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=599.0600000000001s)]
*  but we're probably not beating anybody in the second round, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=602.5200000000001s)]
*  definitely not in the third round. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=604.84s)]
*  So does Durant increase our ceiling [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=606.44s)]
*  despite his injury history? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=608.24s)]
*  And I think the unhappiness history [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=609.52s)]
*  is the bigger point that you bring up. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=613.52s)]
*  So I'm with you, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=615.56s)]
*  but I think these guys constantly remind us [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=617.52s)]
*  that the pursuit of these players [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=621.62s)]
*  is tarnished they can be at some point, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=623.52s)]
*  even at their lowest lows of approval, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  there's still a market for them, right? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=627.92s)]
*  Haven't we learned this lesson enough yet? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=629.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's less the market for the players, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=631.84s)]
*  the more the desperation of the suitors. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, the Warriors are staring [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=637.3s)]
*  at that Jimmy Butler trade for two months, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=638.56s)]
*  and it got to the point with Steph, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=641.28s)]
*  like Steph's gonna be 37, we're gonna waste another year, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  he's already breaking down, we have to do something, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=646.52s)]
*  and you talk yourself into it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=650.16s)]
*  And also the price dropped, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=651.7399999999999s)]
*  which I think really helped them as well. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=653.16s)]
*  It got to the point where it was basically [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=654.64s)]
*  a first wiggins and that was it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=656.2399999999999s)]
*  And also once Butler knew he wasn't going to give his way [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=658.28s)]
*  to the last day, then he's like, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=660.68s)]
*  all right, now I'll go here if we do the extra year. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=661.9599999999999s)]
*  But the Butler thing is a really, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=665.04s)]
*  to me, like this ties into it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=667.86s)]
*  If they had gotten Durant instead of Butler, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=670.26s)]
*  do you think the Warriors would be playing this well? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=672.18s)]
*  Because I would argue, one of the things that I think, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=674.8199999999999s)]
*  and I've watched a ton of Golden State, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=677.8199999999999s)]
*  like I am just so fired up about the Steph comeback. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=679.5799999999999s)]
*  Steph's now making like a second team All-NBA run. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=682.6999999999999s)]
*  Like it's kind of stealth, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=685.18s)]
*  but I think by the time we get to the end of the season, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=686.3s)]
*  I think he's in the top 10 conversation. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=689.06s)]
*  But I think what's made this run special for these guys [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=691.6999999999999s)]
*  is that Butler doesn't care what his stats are. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=694.86s)]
*  Everybody on that team is sacrificing. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=697.58s)]
*  Butler will have games where he doesn't even really shoot. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=699.26s)]
*  Like he's doing like the 2015 Higuedal, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=702.26s)]
*  I'll just play some defense, I'm over here if you need me. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=704.62s)]
*  Oh, you need me, I'll score right now on my guy. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  But for the most part, he's completely bought in. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if Durant at this point in his career [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=712.4200000000001s)]
*  would be able to do all the glue guy stuff [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=716.0200000000001s)]
*  that Butler's doing. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=718.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't know if he's that kind of player anymore. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=719.26s)]
*  To me, he's like, we need him because, like Orlando. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=721.02s)]
*  Like that's a weird fit, right? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=724.9399999999999s)]
*  They have Palo in France, makes no sense. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=726.06s)]
*  But Orlando needs somebody who'd be like, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=727.66s)]
*  I can score a bucket right now. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=729.22s)]
*  I got this, clear out. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=731.04s)]
*  Like it's a team like that that needs scoring. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=732.1s)]
*  I don't know if it was Golden State necessarily. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=735.3199999999999s)]
*  And who knows if he would have been happy. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=738.74s)]
*  We already have his answer. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=740.66s)]
*  He wouldn't have been. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=741.98s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=743.38s)]
*  Because he clearly didn't wanna go there. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=744.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=746.02s)]
*  So even if he had said yes, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=746.86s)]
*  I mean, I guess if you're playing it out [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=747.68s)]
*  in some alternate universe where he's excited, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=748.6999999999999s)]
*  let's do this again. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=751.6999999999999s)]
*  But I don't think that's who he was gonna be. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=753.38s)]
*  And I'm with you. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=755.66s)]
*  Like the Butler passing part of it, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=756.5s)]
*  somebody that you just trust in some of these big spots. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=758.5799999999999s)]
*  Kurs talked about just how smart he is [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=762.42s)]
*  and how good he is in the assist turnover stuff. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=765.0s)]
*  There's some swagger shit with him too [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=768.62s)]
*  that I think is really important. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=770.42s)]
*  That team has an arrogance to it again. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=772.9399999999999s)]
*  And I mean that in a good way. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=774.6999999999999s)]
*  That team's got its thing back. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=776.5s)]
*  And I think he brought it back. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=779.4200000000001s)]
*  Dreymon started playing a little bit better [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=780.7s)]
*  and started carrying himself a little more. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=782.74s)]
*  And at the combo of them, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=784.74s)]
*  I remember the Pistons when they lost Mahorn [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=785.98s)]
*  in the expansion draft after they won the first title. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=789.34s)]
*  Devastating. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=792.0600000000001s)]
*  And they had that whole bad boy thing. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=792.9000000000001s)]
*  He was such a big part of that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=794.82s)]
*  And then he left and it was kind of like, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=796.1800000000001s)]
*  now it's just Lambeer and Isaiah and Rodman. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=799.1s)]
*  And then Rodman had to kind of step up [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=802.4200000000001s)]
*  and fill in that bad boy thing. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=804.22s)]
*  The combo of Dreymon and Butler, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=807.14s)]
*  I think that, and Moody, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=808.5400000000001s)]
*  you can see it's infected him in a good way too. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=810.14s)]
*  He's carrying himself now. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=812.94s)]
*  And I just think that team has real playoff toughness. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=815.02s)]
*  I'm really watching them now as a team. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=818.9s)]
*  I don't think they can beat OKC necessarily, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  but they love playing OKC. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=823.5600000000001s)]
*  They've had great games against them. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  I think they'll be happy to go toe to toe with them. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=826.5400000000001s)]
*  And I think it'll be a good series. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=829.14s)]
*  I think OKC will win. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=830.62s)]
*  But imagine saying that six weeks ago [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=832.9s)]
*  about Golden State, they looked like they were dead. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=835.4599999999999s)]
*  No, I think my favorite stat too for Steph [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=838.14s)]
*  is that he was 22 shots a game in February, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=839.9399999999999s)]
*  and now he's 17. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=841.9s)]
*  And it's because it's not just because Butler. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=843.5799999999999s)]
*  Scoring more. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=845.5s)]
*  Right, he doesn't wanna shoot 22 times a game. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=846.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=850.2199999999999s)]
*  And there's some guys that'll never understand [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=851.06s)]
*  not wanting to shoot 20 times a game. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=852.64s)]
*  And he could shoot 25 if he wanted to, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=854.6999999999999s)]
*  and he'd probably be justified. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=857.38s)]
*  But you can just tell when they were really [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=858.86s)]
*  just grinding offensively, it was like, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=861.62s)]
*  all right, you're running this first thing. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=864.62s)]
*  Steph is cut off. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=866.5400000000001s)]
*  Then it's like, where is it? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=867.62s)]
*  It's coming around the back. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=868.46s)]
*  Oh, it's coming this way. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=869.2800000000001s)]
*  Oh, now he's coming around. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=870.12s)]
*  So at least with Butler, you have to respect him [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=871.46s)]
*  even if you're not being as aggressive. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=873.7s)]
*  And it was funny, because I was looking at his numbers [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=876.14s)]
*  against Wiggins' numbers, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=877.6600000000001s)]
*  and just the points per game are about the same. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=879.38s)]
*  But the rebounding, the assist stuff with him, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=881.7800000000001s)]
*  and Butler's metrics have always been really good this year [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=886.5400000000001s)]
*  because he's still getting such a ridiculous free throw rate [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=888.72s)]
*  because we've covered it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=892.22s)]
*  He's just gonna get you once he seals you at the rim. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=893.6999999999999s)]
*  But you're right, I think last night Moody [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=895.78s)]
*  was getting into guys defensively. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=897.62s)]
*  I just think there's a ceiling on what they'll be able to do. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=899.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm surprised you would think the OKC series [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=902.8199999999999s)]
*  would be competitive because what they're unveiling [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=904.9s)]
*  with this Chet Hardenstein thing, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=907.38s)]
*  that's asking a lot of loony. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=910.14s)]
*  Maybe I'm trying to talk myself into it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=910.98s)]
*  No, it's just, I think the thing that I've noticed [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=912.6999999999999s)]
*  already with Butler, I think it's so hard [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=915.5s)]
*  to just kind of move into that Golden State system [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=917.86s)]
*  and figure out how to play with Steph the right ways. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=920.18s)]
*  And Butler's already figured it out. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=924.38s)]
*  He's like, oh, I got the ball in the corner, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=926.1800000000001s)]
*  but now I see Steph floating around behind me. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=927.98s)]
*  I'm gonna screen my guy and give it back to him. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=930.6600000000001s)]
*  It feels like he's played like 100 games with them. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=932.6600000000001s)]
*  And the only reason I mentioned the OKC thing, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=935.6600000000001s)]
*  and I think OKC is the best team in the league. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=938.5s)]
*  I just feel like they've had, I believe in the model [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=942.3000000000001s)]
*  of we've played this team really well over the years. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=945.38s)]
*  Because I feel the same way about Milwaukee and Cleveland. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=948.26s)]
*  Cleveland's better than Milwaukee. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=950.7800000000001s)]
*  They've played good games against them. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=952.8199999999999s)]
*  I've watched some of them. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=953.8199999999999s)]
*  They're battles. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=954.98s)]
*  They have a real issue with the others. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=955.8199999999999s)]
*  I can't wait for Milwaukee's week, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=956.66s)]
*  going into the night and everything. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=958.5s)]
*  I'm really excited about the Bucs for the next week, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=960.26s)]
*  looking at their schedule. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=962.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=964.1s)]
*  Okay, but back to the original point though. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=965.14s)]
*  Are you playing the results on the Butler fit [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=968.2199999999999s)]
*  and also playing the results on the current Durant fit, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=971.4599999999999s)]
*  where is there still a version of Durant? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=975.1s)]
*  Where say, the reason I always look at Houston [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=978.8199999999999s)]
*  is if Houston goes, okay, look, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=980.98s)]
*  we've done a really good job here. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=983.14s)]
*  We built probably as deep an asset chest [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=984.78s)]
*  as they're in the league, maybe outside of, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=987.14s)]
*  depending on what you think of OKC in the high end. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=989.62s)]
*  I think everybody understands [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=991.46s)]
*  what I'm trying to say here, options, right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=992.5s)]
*  Option depth. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=994.1s)]
*  I'm like, oh, if we did this and this for this guy, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=995.7s)]
*  could you see, the Durant happiness thing is real. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1001.98s)]
*  I don't love the Durant-Shangoon mix. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1005.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't like them as a combo [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1007.54s)]
*  because I can't play any of their real tall guys [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1009.18s)]
*  who can protect the rim with those two. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1011.62s)]
*  They're rolling out some. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1014.06s)]
*  I guess I could play Jabari. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1014.9s)]
*  No, they're going like Jabari, Adam, and Shangoon right now. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1016.06s)]
*  I know, it's weird and their record is kind of, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1018.74s)]
*  they've hung around. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1022.42s)]
*  I think we all thought they were gonna dip. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1023.54s)]
*  Booker makes way more sense to me [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1025.7s)]
*  with Houston than Durant does. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1027.3s)]
*  Booker is exactly what they need. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1029.5s)]
*  That's one of those. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1030.94s)]
*  If you just replace Jalen Green with Booker, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1031.78s)]
*  you'd be like, holy shit, okay. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1033.74s)]
*  Okay, so let's go back to this. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1034.9s)]
*  Is Booker kind of the Pierce phase for Danny Ainge, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1037.26s)]
*  say 2005, 2007 stretch, where Pierce is 28, 29. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1044.42s)]
*  Remember, that's the only real stretch of Pierce's career [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1051.62s)]
*  with Boston where he didn't play, right? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1054.5s)]
*  Because they were like, all right. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1056.94s)]
*  But 06, remember, you remember this. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1057.78s)]
*  Nobody else does. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1059.34s)]
*  Pierce was awesome that one year [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1060.18s)]
*  when they went like 35 and 47. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1061.46s)]
*  Pierce was incredible. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1063.74s)]
*  He was carrying, there was nobody. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1065.18s)]
*  So the question is, is he more Paul Pierce [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1068.98s)]
*  or is he more Ray Allen at that point of their careers? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1070.94s)]
*  Right, so the Pierce year you're talking about [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1074.98s)]
*  is the 06 year, you're right. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1076.9s)]
*  I mean, he's 27 to game. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1078.54s)]
*  27, seven and five. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1080.5s)]
*  He's taken 18 shots a game, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1083.7s)]
*  which actually isn't even the high [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1085.38s)]
*  because he took a lot there in some of those ways. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1086.98s)]
*  The pace was way slower back then. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1088.8200000000002s)]
*  Everybody was, 27 to game back then was 32 now. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1089.78s)]
*  But he took 20 shots a game when he was 25, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1093.58s)]
*  but granted that Boston team was six over 500. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1095.98s)]
*  So that was kind of like the Jim O'Brien, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1099.46s)]
*  was like you guys can do whatever you want. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1101.42s)]
*  Yeah, do whatever you guys want on offense [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1103.1s)]
*  as long as you guys play defense. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1104.8999999999999s)]
*  And so I just felt like- [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1106.22s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1107.42s)]
*  Pierce is the right comparison. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1108.26s)]
*  You're right, because Pierce was a little better [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1109.3s)]
*  than Ray Allen as a two-way guy. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1110.78s)]
*  So what was the point that Ainge always made? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1112.46s)]
*  Because again, I was doing TV back then. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1114.54s)]
*  I had a good relationship with him. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1117.26s)]
*  I would ask him whether he was on the air with us [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1118.98s)]
*  or the times I would run into him with Wallfam [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1121.22s)]
*  and just bullshit. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1124.22s)]
*  And it was always cool that he would do it with me. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1125.0600000000002s)]
*  And I was kind of in the mindset of like a younger guy [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1126.42s)]
*  that we always want everybody to hit the reset button. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1129.14s)]
*  Like two years of not going in the right direction, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1131.14s)]
*  we're like, yep, get rid of everybody, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1133.2600000000002s)]
*  hit the reset button. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1134.5800000000002s)]
*  We all do it in the media. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1135.42s)]
*  We do it as fans constantly. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1136.5800000000002s)]
*  Ishby did that in the interview. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1138.5400000000002s)]
*  He talked about it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1140.0600000000002s)]
*  Everyone just wants to blow it up. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1140.9s)]
*  I don't wanna do that. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1142.2600000000002s)]
*  This is why this is good, because then Ainge would just go, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1143.3000000000002s)]
*  I want more players like Paul Pierce. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1146.18s)]
*  Paul Pierce is, he wouldn't swear obviously, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1148.46s)]
*  because it's Danny, but he's like, Paul Pierce is awesome. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1150.6200000000001s)]
*  It's my job to build around Pierce. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1154.3s)]
*  And it's basically the exact same Ainge range [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1156.58s)]
*  that we're talking about with Booker. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1158.54s)]
*  So- [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1160.4199999999998s)]
*  But there's one crucial difference. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1161.26s)]
*  I know what it is, but go. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1162.3799999999999s)]
*  The Celtics had a bunch of assets [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1163.6999999999998s)]
*  and they had the at least cap space coming down the road [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1166.02s)]
*  and moves to make in the last three years of that decade. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1171.1s)]
*  And I think the difference with the Suns [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1174.06s)]
*  is what are the moves? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1175.6999999999998s)]
*  Because you can, even if you trade to rant, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1177.3s)]
*  you gotta get contracts back. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1179.4199999999998s)]
*  And you're allowed to take two guys back for them [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1183.8999999999999s)]
*  because they're so far over the apron. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1185.74s)]
*  So you almost have to take one guy back [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1187.1799999999998s)]
*  or trade them to a team that could take on the cap space. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1189.6599999999999s)]
*  You gotta get assets back, but then you gotta turn [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1192.3799999999999s)]
*  those assets into more Booker help. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1194.5s)]
*  You aren't able to sign anybody in for AFC [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1196.94s)]
*  and you have no picks. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1199.26s)]
*  Like the Celtics that year, they had Al Jefferson [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1201.1s)]
*  and they had Rondo and they had Gerald Green, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1203.1799999999998s)]
*  who weirdly- [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1205.7s)]
*  Ryan Gomes. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1206.54s)]
*  Ryan Gomes, they had first round picks to trade. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1207.3799999999999s)]
*  And I think the biggest difference [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1210.6599999999999s)]
*  between the two is that the Suns doesn't have any of that. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1211.4599999999998s)]
*  I would be, if I was a Suns fan, I'd be so bummed out [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1214.3s)]
*  because I don't think there's anything worse [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1217.78s)]
*  than being unwatchable, but also having no hope [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1219.1399999999999s)]
*  for the next couple of years. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1223.3799999999999s)]
*  And I don't see how you have hope if you're them. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1225.1399999999999s)]
*  So a Booker tells you, you're Ishby and Booker's like, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1227.54s)]
*  look, I get it, there's no wiggle room here. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1229.9799999999998s)]
*  And that's the biggest difference [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1233.26s)]
*  between the Pierce-Booker comp [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1234.26s)]
*  that we're coming up with here [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1236.02s)]
*  is that there were at least outs. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1236.86s)]
*  And the new second and all of the stuff, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1238.46s)]
*  the restrictions, it's far more restrictive, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1240.3000000000002s)]
*  this current situation. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1241.9s)]
*  If Booker goes to you, you're Ishby is like, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1243.0600000000002s)]
*  you know what, I know this, but I don't wanna go anywhere. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1244.74s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1247.02s)]
*  You keep them at that point, at least for another year. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1249.54s)]
*  And you try to make the best Durant deal you can. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1252.0600000000002s)]
*  And you fire everybody who told you [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1255.18s)]
*  you shouldn't trade for Brad to be able [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1258.5800000000002s)]
*  to do trade quotes. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1259.8200000000002s)]
*  I think whoever's left in the building who was like, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1261.7s)]
*  I do it, they have to go. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1263.8200000000002s)]
*  You just have to clear the deck. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1266.54s)]
*  Because we did the worst contract draft [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1269.6599999999999s)]
*  and Woz took Bradley Beale first. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1272.1s)]
*  And he was right to trade for that when you have no, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1274.46s)]
*  to trade for a contract with no outs [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1277.3799999999999s)]
*  is the most irresponsible thing you can do as a franchise. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1279.94s)]
*  And then the D&B contracts probably second. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1283.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't know what they do. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1285.54s)]
*  And it's one of the most shocking things [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1286.58s)]
*  I can remember in recent NBA history [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1289.18s)]
*  because we thought Phoenix was gonna be good. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1291.42s)]
*  Like legit good. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1294.5s)]
*  And they're the opposite, they're awful. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1296.8200000000002s)]
*  We'll take a break. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1298.38s)]
*  I have a couple more things to throw you related to this. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1299.98s)]

*  and I was like, I think I've already tweeted about this. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1439.9s)]
*  I went back and saw what they used their cap for that summer. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1441.9s)]
*  It was Chetty Osmond and Campagne. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1446.0600000000002s)]
*  And they just could have had Reeves. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1450.18s)]
*  I don't think they ever made, the story I heard [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1451.46s)]
*  was Reeves and his camp was waiting for an offer, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1453.26s)]
*  waiting for an offer and the Spurs were like, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1455.8200000000002s)]
*  we're gonna get one, we're gonna get one. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1457.22s)]
*  And then the Lakers smartly were like, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1459.38s)]
*  you gotta tell us by tonight if you're doing this. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1461.7800000000002s)]
*  And the Spurs were just too late, never did it. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1464.8200000000002s)]
*  And then after the fact, we're like, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1466.94s)]
*  yeah, you know, we're a year away. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1468.3000000000002s)]
*  But I was just, it made me so mad thinking [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1470.38s)]
*  two Texas teams have rebuilt the Lakers. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1473.22s)]
*  The Mavericks and the Spurs. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1476.98s)]
*  The Lakers are just headed toward the cliff [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1478.5800000000002s)]
*  with old LeBron and the AD hitting his mid thirties [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1482.1000000000001s)]
*  and no real ability to rebuild. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1485.74s)]
*  And now they're gonna be really good for the next 10 years. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1487.9s)]
*  And it's cause of these two dumb ass Texas teams. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1490.5800000000002s)]
*  It makes me so mad. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1492.78s)]
*  I would tell you that Reeves camp really appreciates [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1495.3400000000001s)]
*  you bringing this up probably every six weeks. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1497.7s)]
*  I'll do it every three weeks. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1500.8600000000001s)]
*  Reeves is legitimately good. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1503.9s)]
*  Could Reeves make the All-Star team? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1506.02s)]
*  I think he could. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1507.5800000000002s)]
*  Not this year, but in the next three years, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1508.82s)]
*  could he be an All-Star? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1510.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think he could. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1511.5800000000002s)]
*  Is he as good as Jeff Hornacek was? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1513.02s)]
*  I think he is. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1515.38s)]
*  Reeves is, I wanna do a third banana list with you [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1516.82s)]
*  and see where he ranks in the third bananas. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1520.46s)]
*  I just can't believe we were talking that whole season about. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1523.3400000000001s)]
*  Grant Williams is hurt. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1526.8999999999999s)]
*  Shit. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1528.06s)]
*  Well, remember when we were like, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1528.8999999999999s)]
*  would they offer him four for, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1531.26s)]
*  could somebody offer him four for 98? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1532.82s)]
*  That's the max he could go. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1534.54s)]
*  Like, that's a lot. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1535.6599999999999s)]
*  It's like, well, that's 20 plus million a year. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1536.9799999999998s)]
*  Anyway, they got him for what, 12, 13? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1539.34s)]
*  Clearly the Spurs didn't think he was. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1541.74s)]
*  And then it allows them all this other stuff. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1542.58s)]
*  The Spurs could not have thought [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1544.06s)]
*  he was gonna be this good. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1545.3s)]
*  How? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1547.6999999999998s)]
*  I don't, that's where, you know, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1550.3799999999999s)]
*  and the Spurs have done good stuff over the years. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1552.54s)]
*  And like they nailed the Castle Pick last year. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1554.6999999999998s)]
*  No, I mean, in recent times, they nailed the Castle Pick. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1557.54s)]
*  Right, I'm just saying the Spurs track record [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1559.8600000000001s)]
*  has been pretty good for a long time. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1561.42s)]
*  Spurs track record is good. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1562.26s)]
*  I'm talking recently, maybe not as good. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1563.1000000000001s)]
*  But they did nail the Castle Pick. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1564.94s)]
*  Yeah, if you wanna tell me there's some misses in there, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1565.78s)]
*  okay, you got me. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1566.98s)]
*  I think Reeves is a miss. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1567.82s)]
*  It's a huge miss. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1570.1000000000001s)]
*  They had the cap space. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1570.94s)]
*  Trade him, he's an asset. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1572.38s)]
*  Or sign him, he's an asset. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1573.46s)]
*  The biggest thing to you is make him the offer [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1575.1000000000001s)]
*  so that LA has to match. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1577.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1579.3s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1580.66s)]
*  Another one I don't have an answer for. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1582.46s)]
*  That almost sounded like cow herd right there. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1584.54s)]
*  Still don't have a real answer [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1587.3799999999999s)]
*  for why the Embiid extension happened. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1590.42s)]
*  And here's another one you and I have talked about [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1592.22s)]
*  for a while. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1593.94s)]
*  And there's still some buck passing going on with it. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1595.62s)]
*  And nobody's really owned it yet. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1597.74s)]
*  I've heard various stories about it. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1600.1s)]
*  I've gotten some intel on it. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1601.7s)]
*  Can you share? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1603.5s)]
*  Give me what you've heard. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1604.46s)]
*  He means a lot to Philly. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1610.42s)]
*  It's the right thing to do. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1612.5s)]
*  If his body breaks down, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1614.8600000000001s)]
*  we'll be able to cover it with insurance anyway. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1616.5400000000002s)]
*  It'll be a huge distraction if we don't do this. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1619.66s)]
*  We should just do it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1621.7800000000002s)]
*  And odds are he's gonna be healthy. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1622.9s)]
*  Was the case. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1624.8600000000001s)]
*  Odds are. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1626.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1627.98s)]
*  Yeah, I felt like the public stuff about ownership [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1629.7800000000002s)]
*  being like, you know, weren't sure about this one. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1632.66s)]
*  You're like, too. Ridiculous. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1635.26s)]
*  I mean- It's ridiculous. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1636.8600000000001s)]
*  These owners run these teams. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1637.8600000000001s)]
*  They make every decision [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1640.5s)]
*  that's even 10% as important as this. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1642.1799999999998s)]
*  They're making the decision. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1644.34s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1645.3799999999999s)]
*  The number of trades they wanna do, don't we? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1646.34s)]
*  Like, just over the years, you're like, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1648.02s)]
*  what happened with that? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1650.74s)]
*  And it's like, oh, the owner. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1651.78s)]
*  Like, what are you? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1653.86s)]
*  Like, I remember how long it took me [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1654.6999999999998s)]
*  to finally just accept that the owners are, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1656.2199999999998s)]
*  they don't let somebody just go, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1659.62s)]
*  yeah, what'd you guys do today? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1661.54s)]
*  Good news. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1664.86s)]
*  No, it's so true. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1666.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, and the owner can become the boogeyman sometimes [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1667.6599999999999s)]
*  when you talk to teams. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1670.4199999999998s)]
*  Where if it was a draft pick that, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1672.94s)]
*  and you're like, wow. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1674.74s)]
*  And the owner really pushed for that. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1676.98s)]
*  So that's kind of, we shouldn't have listened to them on that. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1678.46s)]
*  So you never know what's real and not real. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1681.1399999999999s)]
*  You know those. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1682.86s)]
*  There's some of that stuff, too. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1683.7s)]
*  We know the teams. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1684.54s)]
*  I don't wanna list them [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1685.66s)]
*  because I don't wanna betray anybody. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1686.5s)]
*  But there's some teams where they use owners [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1687.98s)]
*  as the boogeyman. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1689.74s)]
*  Because like, when Gaston, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1690.94s)]
*  before Wick and the guys had bought Celtics, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1692.34s)]
*  which is honestly one of the greatest things [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1694.9s)]
*  that could have happened, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1696.66s)]
*  but Gaston would apparently just say, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1697.74s)]
*  and if it's a dollar over, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1700.98s)]
*  it's coming out of your pocket. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1702.62s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1703.78s)]
*  Like as hands off as you could possibly be as an owner. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1704.62s)]
*  But is that awesome? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1708.82s)]
*  Or does that actually suck [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1711.02s)]
*  that you can't go to your owner and say, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1713.02s)]
*  hey, we have this on the table. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1714.3s)]
*  And here's, we can work with this. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1716.1s)]
*  If you allow us this, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1719.6599999999999s)]
*  and then maybe next year we cut it back down to here. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1720.78s)]
*  I don't know if being that rigid, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1724.4199999999998s)]
*  at least you kind of know where you stand [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1725.86s)]
*  and what your parameters are for a team. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1727.5s)]
*  But I, specific to the Embiid thing, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1729.02s)]
*  and I like Josh Harris a lot, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1732.66s)]
*  but you're not, you can't tell me like, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1734.06s)]
*  you didn't wanna do it, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1737.1399999999999s)]
*  and Darryl and the staff convinced you to do it. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1738.9s)]
*  And Josh has been around sports, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1742.74s)]
*  like he's in the- [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1744.3799999999999s)]
*  Josh has run, he has run companies, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1745.22s)]
*  he owns two professional sports teams [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1746.82s)]
*  that are very expensive and have a lot of employees. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1748.7s)]
*  He's not just passing off that decision to somebody else. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1751.82s)]
*  This is not a defense of Darryl, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1755.1s)]
*  because I'm sure Darryl really wanted to do it too. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1756.62s)]
*  But to make it seem like you had to be talked into it, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1759.26s)]
*  but deep down you knew it was a bad idea, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1764.22s)]
*  like get the fuck outta here, stop. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1766.06s)]
*  Yeah, that one, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1767.5s)]
*  that one I'm gonna have a hard time believing, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1768.34s)]
*  cause then it spins it back into Darryl, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1769.8999999999999s)]
*  and the difference between your relationship [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1771.6999999999998s)]
*  with Darryl and mine is pretty wide, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1774.8999999999999s)]
*  but I think I'm always fair about it, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1777.58s)]
*  cause I think he's really good. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1779.22s)]
*  I try to be fair too. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1780.54s)]
*  Right. It's been a rough year. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1781.54s)]
*  It does seem like it's one of those dumb, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1782.78s)]
*  cultural, organizational, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1786.82s)]
*  like we pay Paul George 200 million, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1789.3s)]
*  we max Maxie out at his number, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1792.18s)]
*  and he was nice enough to wait, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1795.7s)]
*  so like let's get everybody on the same financial timeline, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1797.06s)]
*  and you're just thinking to yourself, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1800.3799999999999s)]
*  and clearly like the announcement of it [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1802.02s)]
*  being that close to the start of the season, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1803.58s)]
*  means that they probably had already come [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1806.1s)]
*  to some kind of general agreement, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1808.3799999999999s)]
*  maybe before the Olympics even happened. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1810.5s)]
*  But the way we're seeing it is like, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1813.18s)]
*  this many weeks after you saw him laboring [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1816.58s)]
*  during the Olympics, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1818.66s)]
*  and you don't even have to do this extension, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1819.62s)]
*  and you've got another player, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1821.38s)]
*  like why would you be in a hurry [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1822.98s)]
*  to hand this guy that kind of money, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1826.74s)]
*  but I think it comes back to a lot of stuff, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1828.38s)]
*  is like if you're gonna pay these other guys [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1830.1s)]
*  and what he means to the city and all that different stuff. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1831.42s)]
*  I think the unbeat part that's a little curious is that, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1833.22s)]
*  I don't know that he's actually a blast day to day, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1838.2600000000002s)]
*  and it doesn't really get talked about a ton, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1842.6200000000001s)]
*  which good for him, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1846.0600000000002s)]
*  and I know there was the part of it [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1847.14s)]
*  where it kind of leaked out last year, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1848.6200000000001s)]
*  and then he was upset. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1850.14s)]
*  That he was late to stuff, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1851.5400000000002s)]
*  and people were talking about it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1852.94s)]
*  That he was late to stuff, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1853.7800000000002s)]
*  and people were talking about it. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1854.6200000000001s)]
*  But I have a feeling like, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1855.46s)]
*  it's like a lot of organizations, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1858.3400000000001s)]
*  where if you have one of these guys, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1860.7s)]
*  when he's right, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1862.0600000000002s)]
*  it's a top five player in the world, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1862.9s)]
*  you do whatever he wants, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1864.3000000000002s)]
*  but you just hope that him doing whatever he wants, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1865.5s)]
*  is in line with you trying to win as many games [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1868.3s)]
*  as you possibly can. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1871.54s)]
*  And I'm not even really, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1872.38s)]
*  I'm trying to be fair about this whole thing, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1875.1s)]
*  because it's not like an embed only situation, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1876.66s)]
*  because we always hear about this kind of stuff, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1878.58s)]
*  but it felt like there was a lot of things [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1879.94s)]
*  that probably could have told everybody involved. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1882.74s)]
*  Do we wanna wait on this maybe just a year? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1885.74s)]
*  Take a year, yeah, take a year. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1887.54s)]
*  Here's another one I just don't have an answer for. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1890.06s)]
*  Oh, this is a good one. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1892.66s)]
*  Is Denver good? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1895.54s)]
*  Ooh, now you're cooking. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1897.58s)]
*  Are they good? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1901.7s)]
*  If they lost 4-1 in round one, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1903.06s)]
*  would you be like, I can't believe it? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1905.66s)]
*  There were no signs at all. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1908.02s)]
*  If they made the Western Finals, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1909.74s)]
*  would you be like, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1911.26s)]
*  I can't believe they made the Western Finals. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1912.1s)]
*  I don't know, to me, they are like, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1914.42s)]
*  I don't know what to expect. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1916.74s)]
*  They're like one of those boxers [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1918.18s)]
*  that they could knock somebody out, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1919.54s)]
*  they could get knocked out. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1921.02s)]
*  It could be, or they're almost like a UFC fighter. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1922.54s)]
*  I don't know what UFC fighter that would be like, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1925.9s)]
*  Gachey, Gachey might just get fucking cold cops. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1927.5s)]
*  Rock cold? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1930.34s)]
*  He might have an awesome fight today. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1931.18s)]
*  I watched a lot of the Laker game, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1934.3s)]
*  and I watched the fourth quarter [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1936.78s)]
*  of the Washington game last night. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1938.1s)]
*  Wow, and you're coming off the Wizards game last night. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1939.38s)]
*  No, but I watched almost that entire Laker game [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1941.62s)]
*  when they didn't have Luca and they didn't have LeBron, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1944.86s)]
*  and they're just hanging with Reeves and Connect. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1947.7s)]
*  That's what made me so mad about Reeves on Friday night. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1949.7s)]
*  Denver was trying, and they were home, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1952.7s)]
*  and they needed the game, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1955.5s)]
*  and they're barely hanging on against this G League Laker [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1956.62s)]
*  team with Reeves, and I was just like, what the fuck? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1960.22s)]
*  To me, we talked a week ago about the MVP of the OKids. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1964.54s)]
*  I don't know what scenario would happen for SGA [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1967.62s)]
*  not to win the MVP at this point after the week he had, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1970.94s)]
*  but is Denver good? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1973.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, let's see here. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1978.62s)]
*  I thought the Washington game was more alarming. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1981.02s)]
*  I think it's a good way, if we're gonna be critical [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1985.7800000000002s)]
*  of when he gets into games, let's be positive [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1988.5400000000002s)]
*  when he's a plus eight, Ronnie James plus eight [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1990.22s)]
*  in 16 minutes in that game. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1992.18s)]
*  Fair. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1994.6200000000001s)]
*  That's the Doc Rivers rule, all right? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1995.46s)]
*  The Doc Rivers rule, full effect against that Lakers version [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=1997.42s)]
*  of a team out there. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2000.94s)]
*  Did Dalton take 30 shots in that game, by the way? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2002.26s)]
*  Yeah, 13 to 27. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2004.7s)]
*  He's playing hard, too. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2006.66s)]
*  Okay, so that one. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2008.6200000000001s)]
*  Seemed like he got concussed at the end. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2009.46s)]
*  He was, Duncan's already hit his head. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2011.5s)]
*  I think that game was far more alarming [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2013.78s)]
*  than I think the Lakers won, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2016.38s)]
*  because I'm going with the Doc Rivers rule, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2017.5s)]
*  where I'd rather the other team have everybody [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2018.98s)]
*  so I know my guys are in, and I think that game, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2021.5s)]
*  they went into it being like, whatever. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2024.22s)]
*  To be up seven, I think with four minutes to go [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2026.14s)]
*  on the Wizards, where you were up, they get back into it, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2028.34s)]
*  it's stupid, Poole has the most Jordan Poole [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2031.9s)]
*  last few minutes of a basketball game [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2034.86s)]
*  you could ever imagine, hits the game winner on a shot [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2036.82s)]
*  where it was like just feeling himself. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2038.86s)]
*  A 34 footer. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2040.54s)]
*  Attending the take, coming out of the timeout. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2042.42s)]
*  I know Gordon played in, he played in the Lakers game [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2045.2600000000002s)]
*  31 minutes, but he didn't play in the Wizards game. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2049.1s)]
*  So I just have to have fully formed Aaron Gordon, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2051.02s)]
*  and if you run through it, are you gonna take, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2053.78s)]
*  like if the two through five right now is a game [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2056.46s)]
*  in the West, if it's Minnesota, Denver, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2059.7400000000002s)]
*  are you picking Minnesota right now? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2063.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I could change it in a week, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2066.3s)]
*  but from what I've been watching the last month, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2067.86s)]
*  I would take Minnesota against Denver. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2070.3s)]
*  And I also feel like Minnesota seems like they genuinely [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2072.62s)]
*  feel like they have Denver's number for whatever reason. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2075.26s)]
*  They'd be a really hard series for Denver. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2077.94s)]
*  Minnesota looked great against them the other night. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2080.34s)]
*  They really like playing Denver. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2082.54s)]
*  Yeah, the Denver, I think the biggest Denver issue [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2084.54s)]
*  is that when you saw them go up against OKC [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2087.34s)]
*  and then you saw them go up against Minnesota, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2090.14s)]
*  it was just back to back games where you're watching [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2092.34s)]
*  Christian Brown have to defend SGA and then Ant. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2094.78s)]
*  And I don't know if Aaron Gordon becomes the guy, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2098.94s)]
*  I don't know if he's playing either of those games, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2102.22s)]
*  is Aaron Gordon somebody that you go, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2104.06s)]
*  hey, in a playoff series or at least fourth quarter, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2105.38s)]
*  like we feel like we can throw this guy at him. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2107.22s)]
*  There's just a lot of perimeter size there [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2109.06s)]
*  with those two teams that would be a problem for Denver. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2110.86s)]
*  I have more issues than that. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2113.54s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2116.14s)]
*  There's a lot of Westbrook. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2117.98s)]
*  Like he's involved. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2119.7799999999997s)]
*  And I know Gordon's been out, and when Gordon's out, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2121.7799999999997s)]
*  there's more Westbrook. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2124.34s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2125.86s)]
*  And he's, I think Ben, that's been a winning signing. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2127.1s)]
*  He's great. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2129.94s)]
*  But he's in a lot, if this is a movie, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2130.86s)]
*  he's in a lot of scenes. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2133.58s)]
*  Like, oh, Westbrook's in this scene too? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2134.98s)]
*  Oh man, he's gonna be in the shootout scene? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2137.7000000000003s)]
*  Like he's just in it. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2140.3s)]
*  Do you have an example? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2141.7400000000002s)]
*  Christian Brown is like incredibly important now, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2142.98s)]
*  as you mentioned. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2147.46s)]
*  They have no bench whatsoever. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2149.02s)]
*  And the thing that alarms me the most, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2150.58s)]
*  Rossella, they have some of the worst defensive possessions [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2152.7000000000003s)]
*  short of the Suns. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2155.42s)]
*  There was a Washington play with like two minutes left. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2156.94s)]
*  Who was that rookie from the Swedish kid? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2160.02s)]
*  He made the three in the corner [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2162.54s)]
*  because everybody forgot he was in the corner. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2163.7400000000002s)]
*  Remember that, with like a minute left? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2165.98s)]
*  Are you talking about Bilal? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2167.9s)]
*  One of those kids, I forget who made it. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2169.7400000000002s)]
*  What, Miami, the Miami rookie, Keishon George? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2171.62s)]
*  It was George, I think, is who you're talking about. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2174.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2176.7000000000003s)]
*  They just forgot he was in the corner, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2178.62s)]
*  and Jordan Poole, they double teamed, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2180.42s)]
*  Yoko just double teamed Poole for no reason. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2181.98s)]
*  And then nobody swung over, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2185.2200000000003s)]
*  and there's just a wide open guy in the corner. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2187.5s)]
*  And it was like a huge play. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2188.62s)]
*  They just have some really bad sequences. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2191.62s)]
*  And sometimes, I think Yoko just so great, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2193.8999999999996s)]
*  he just makes up for a lot, or Murray Hill at a three. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2196.74s)]
*  But they seem really, after the All-Star break, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2199.02s)]
*  I was thinking, oh man, they could really do this. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2203.22s)]
*  And now I'm wavering. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2205.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't like what I'm seeing. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2207.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know where they are in FanDuel right now. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2208.98s)]
*  I was looking at it this morning, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2210.7799999999997s)]
*  but they're still with this Lakers dip [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2211.8999999999996s)]
*  and LeBron missing time, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2214.66s)]
*  which I don't know how fair it is to judge [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2216.74s)]
*  any of this Lakers stuff the last week or so. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2218.42s)]
*  With LeBron not playing, it's kind of pointless, right? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2221.3799999999997s)]
*  But Denver still kind of thought of as this fourth team. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2224.94s)]
*  I think they were fourth in odds. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2227.3399999999997s)]
*  Are they right now still? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2228.74s)]
*  FanDuel second in the West for odds now, plus 600. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2229.58s)]
*  If Golden State played Denver in a series [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2233.74s)]
*  with what you've seen right now, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2236.8199999999997s)]
*  put Gordon back into it, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2238.54s)]
*  and put in that Yoko Chaz really owned Golden State [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2240.5s)]
*  over the last couple years. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2243.82s)]
*  Would you feel great about taking Denver in that? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2247.46s)]
*  I think that series would be like a 50-50. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2249.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, is Draymond defending Yokochi, I guess, primarily? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2253.2200000000003s)]
*  Or are they gonna just try to- [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2256.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think that would be a loony Jackson Davis [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2257.7000000000003s)]
*  bringing that post to try to spread him. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2262.7000000000003s)]
*  Or you bring him out hoping he can stretch. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2264.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2267.82s)]
*  Yeah, you might have Post in there [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2268.6600000000003s)]
*  hoping to run Yokochi around. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2269.6600000000003s)]
*  I like that you brought up the Westbrook thing, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2270.9s)]
*  because everybody knows how I feel [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2272.42s)]
*  about the long form of Westbrook, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2275.34s)]
*  but he's been really important for them. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2277.46s)]
*  And considering the value on it, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2278.86s)]
*  and all the minutes, and all the shots available, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2280.66s)]
*  and all that stuff, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2282.46s)]
*  I also think it's the most accepting Westbrook [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2283.34s)]
*  has ever been of his role. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2285.02s)]
*  But I see the playoff limitation stuff, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2286.9s)]
*  where I'll go, if you're gonna run him out there. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2291.02s)]
*  I thought that Lakers, not this game, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2293.94s)]
*  the other one that we did the show after that game, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2295.5s)]
*  I thought the lack of spacing [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2299.38s)]
*  with the Westbrook-Brown lineup, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2301.02s)]
*  and then Gordon's also somebody, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2302.94s)]
*  even with his shooting numbers being really good this year, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2304.46s)]
*  teams are gonna cheat off of him. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2306.54s)]
*  And it's not that you'd wanna, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2309.2599999999998s)]
*  you don't wanna be doubling Yokochi in a predictable way, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2311.9s)]
*  where then he's burning you with guys cutting all the time. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2314.18s)]
*  But I feel like I've noticed, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2316.22s)]
*  and maybe it's because I look for it, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2318.3s)]
*  and so maybe I'm wrong with it. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2320.5s)]
*  But there's just moments where Westbrook [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2321.86s)]
*  gets a little jumpy with Yokochi late, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2323.7s)]
*  where he's actually trying to defer to him [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2326.1s)]
*  in a way that I've never really ever seen him defer [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2328.2599999999998s)]
*  to another player, that he can force the ball back to him. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2330.2599999999998s)]
*  If he misses a late three, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2333.5s)]
*  I don't think he'll wanna take the next one. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2335.38s)]
*  And if there's a Lakers series, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2338.62s)]
*  I'm convinced the Lakers are like, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2340.74s)]
*  he's gonna want revenge on us so bad in this series [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2342.18s)]
*  that we're not even worried about. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2344.46s)]
*  Oh, one of my favorite theories. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2345.3s)]
*  Any playoff series, he's just wide open. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2348.18s)]
*  Just know that going in. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2350.38s)]
*  In the last five minutes of any playoff game, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2351.66s)]
*  if he's out there, he's gonna be left open. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2353.42s)]
*  I'm worried about Denver. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2355.5s)]
*  I don't like that they can't get stops [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2357.5s)]
*  when they don't need it, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2359.1s)]
*  and I don't like how involved Westbrook is, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2359.94s)]
*  and I don't like that they don't have a bench at all. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2361.7400000000002s)]
*  Here's my next one for you. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2363.58s)]
*  They're playing Murray and Yokochi [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2365.42s)]
*  40 minutes a game in March, too. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2367.06s)]
*  Red flag. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2369.82s)]
*  Is Tibbs a coach that you could actually see [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2372.34s)]
*  winning four straight playoff rounds? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2374.54s)]
*  That's my next, I don't have an answer for this. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2378.7s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2381.02s)]
*  They're not going to, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2382.86s)]
*  but I think he's one of the smartest basketball people [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2383.98s)]
*  I've ever seen. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2386.34s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2387.5s)]
*  Is he one of the smartest defensive coaches [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2388.34s)]
*  you've ever seen, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2390.34s)]
*  or is he one of the smartest coaches you've seen? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2391.1800000000003s)]
*  I know where you're going with this, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2394.54s)]
*  with the minutes and everything, but. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2395.5s)]
*  No, I'm not going to the minutes, actually. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2397.46s)]
*  I'm going to the offense. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2398.78s)]
*  Because it's really been interesting, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2401.34s)]
*  and I had some Knicks fans in my life [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2403.98s)]
*  who predicted this when Brunson got hurt, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2405.5s)]
*  that they were like, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2408.58s)]
*  if he can just come back in time for the playoffs healthy, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2409.42s)]
*  this actually might be a good thing for us, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2411.58s)]
*  because we were too Brunson-centric, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2413.1400000000003s)]
*  we were too predictable, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2415.54s)]
*  Bridges was being wasted in some of these games, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2417.22s)]
*  we weren't going to Towns in some fourth quarters, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2419.74s)]
*  we were actually going to feel like more of a team [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2422.78s)]
*  and more of an offense, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2425.26s)]
*  because all these guys are chipping in. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2426.34s)]
*  Bridges has immediately been better. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2428.1s)]
*  And I think the frustrating thing I've had [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2430.3s)]
*  watching Knicks this year is just, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2432.74s)]
*  they're not using all the parts of Bridges. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2434.98s)]
*  You give up all those picks for him, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2437.26s)]
*  and you throw them in the fucking corner. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2438.94s)]
*  And I don't know, I think he's really good with the ball. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2441.22s)]
*  I think he's good at deciding, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2444.38s)]
*  if you set him a pick 25 feet from the basket, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2446.86s)]
*  I think he makes good decisions. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2449.1000000000004s)]
*  He can go to the basket, he can pull up, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2450.5s)]
*  he's a good passer. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2452.34s)]
*  And they didn't use them at all. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2453.7400000000002s)]
*  And they just kind of ran Brunson into the ground. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2454.82s)]
*  It's not why he got hurt. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2457.06s)]
*  But I think the more you use somebody, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2458.7400000000002s)]
*  the more the chances increase that they might get hurt. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2460.5s)]
*  I just feel like they, in a weird way, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2464.34s)]
*  have more balance without Brunson, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2466.34s)]
*  but they're obviously better with Brunson. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2468.02s)]
*  And maybe this was good for him. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2469.98s)]
*  I don't know what Tipz was doing [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2471.46s)]
*  for 60 games is my point. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2472.62s)]
*  I don't know what they were doing with Brunson, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2474.58s)]
*  without Bridges at all. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2476.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2477.62s)]
*  Bridges is an interesting case, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2479.8199999999997s)]
*  because we felt like he was [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2481.2599999999998s)]
*  just an unbelievable fourth option, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2483.86s)]
*  and we all still had hope for Ayton, right, and Phoenix. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2485.98s)]
*  I mean, his shot attempts per game, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2488.98s)]
*  seven, six and a half, nine, 10 and a half. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2491.38s)]
*  Then he peaked at 13 and a half, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2494.06s)]
*  and then he gets traded, right, in the Durant deal. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2495.9s)]
*  And that run with Brooklyn with him, 22, 23. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2498.7s)]
*  And I brought up with my pod, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2501.22s)]
*  because I went to a game and watched him in person. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2502.94s)]
*  And I was like, damn. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2505.3s)]
*  Like this is, this is. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2506.78s)]
*  Sophisticated, sophisticated offense. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2507.6200000000003s)]
*  And it was him getting wherever he wanted to, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2509.78s)]
*  initiating the possession where, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2512.94s)]
*  maybe he'd always had it, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2516.0600000000004s)]
*  but you just, there's never ever gonna be a time [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2517.0600000000004s)]
*  where you needed that from him and Phoenix, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2519.02s)]
*  or maybe you did, I don't know. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2520.6600000000003s)]
*  So like, yeah, I'm with you. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2521.7400000000002s)]
*  33 the other night against Portland, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2523.2200000000003s)]
*  seeing him remind me of the Nets version, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2525.2200000000003s)]
*  because the second year with the Nets, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2527.54s)]
*  the shot attempts go way down. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2529.42s)]
*  I think he was kind of miserable. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2530.9s)]
*  It was pretty clear, like he wasn't playing offense [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2532.7000000000003s)]
*  the way that he was playing it before. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2535.86s)]
*  And I've pointed out the Cam Thomas part of it. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2537.42s)]
*  Nets fans don't like hearing that from me. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2540.46s)]
*  I don't know, I thought it was kind of obvious, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2542.1800000000003s)]
*  but Cam ended up being really good at the start of this year. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2543.6200000000003s)]
*  So maybe it was deserving of him. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2545.82s)]
*  So here's my question. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2547.82s)]
*  Do you think Tibbs, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2549.86s)]
*  like do you think Tibbs just messed up [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2552.1s)]
*  the Mikhail Bridges thing this year? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2553.54s)]
*  Because that's what it sounds like you're saying. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2554.9s)]
*  And I don't really have the evidence [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2556.06s)]
*  to tell you it's different. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2557.2200000000003s)]
*  I guess, I don't know. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2558.06s)]
*  That Brunson, let me just say this though, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2559.1s)]
*  that Brunson cat thing is like the best points [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2561.66s)]
*  per possession thing in the league. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2563.74s)]
*  It's one of the best things in the league. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2564.86s)]
*  And their offense is awesome. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2566.86s)]
*  If there's anything that's been wrong with him this year, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2569.02s)]
*  it's their defense. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2570.7799999999997s)]
*  So my counter, well it's not a counter, we're not arguing. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2573.02s)]
*  But I feel like when you have an offense like that [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2577.02s)]
*  and you have these five guys who are all good [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2579.02s)]
*  in different ways, Heart does need the ball, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2580.86s)]
*  the other guys kind of do at least sometimes. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2582.38s)]
*  It's like you're at a concert [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2585.62s)]
*  and it's like, ah, you gotta play that Keith Richards song. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2587.7s)]
*  Yeah, let's just do it. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2593.22s)]
*  And then we'll do start me up after, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2595.62s)]
*  we'll get the crowd back into it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2597.02s)]
*  But you gotta give Keith like this five minutes. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2598.18s)]
*  You kind of have to do that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2600.2999999999997s)]
*  Like this is one of my criticisms with the Celtics. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2601.46s)]
*  Sometimes they forget that Derek White is really good, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2604.4199999999996s)]
*  especially against certain matchups with the ball. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2607.3799999999997s)]
*  Or like run him a pick, like he makes good decisions. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2609.66s)]
*  It breaks you out of the monotony [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2612.62s)]
*  of just Tatum and Brown launching threes. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2613.9399999999996s)]
*  I think coaches forget sometimes that you just, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2616.7s)]
*  when you sprinkle guys in and get them a little involved, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2621.02s)]
*  you get more out of it later. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2623.7799999999997s)]
*  Bridges was on autopilot in some of these Knicks games [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2625.3799999999997s)]
*  I was watching because he wasn't involved. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2627.66s)]
*  And I think he's a really good player. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2631.02s)]
*  And that's why they gave up five first round picks for him [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2633.1s)]
*  and all of us were like, okay, I get it. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2635.2599999999998s)]
*  Bridges is really good. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2637.22s)]
*  Whatever they were getting out of him this year, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2638.7s)]
*  I thought they were weeks and stretches that it just, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2640.4199999999996s)]
*  at least from what I was watching, I wasn't that impressed. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2643.1s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2646.2200000000003s)]
*  I like it, I like it by the way. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2647.06s)]
*  Why not? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2648.46s)]
*  I don't know how many times he was initiating [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2649.3s)]
*  his own offense. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2651.06s)]
*  Maybe this is a Kurt Goldsberry shot chart [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2651.9s)]
*  so we can see the difference between his peak net season [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2653.9s)]
*  two years ago and then where it is, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2657.2200000000003s)]
*  if it's all stuck in the corner with a few elbows in there. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2659.06s)]
*  But all I know is that when I saw it live two years ago, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2662.02s)]
*  I thought this guy can kind of like, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2665.7400000000002s)]
*  this is almost like Booker Durant type shit [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2667.86s)]
*  in this mid-range pull-up. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2670.54s)]
*  And then in the scoot reckoning game, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2671.7000000000003s)]
*  which unfortunately Scoot lost in that overtime, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2674.46s)]
*  Nick's winner, Bridges was doing a lot of the stuff [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2678.34s)]
*  that made me think like, oh, okay, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2682.98s)]
*  this is a hole in the love. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2685.34s)]
*  So yeah, I'm open to it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2686.1800000000003s)]
*  I guess I would have to, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2687.26s)]
*  I'd wanna see kind of the shot chart more of it. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2688.66s)]
*  But you're probably right, right? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2691.82s)]
*  I mean, Brunson's initiating [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2693.14s)]
*  every single thing they're doing, so I'm sure. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2694.2200000000003s)]
*  Plus you can put Brunson on the side [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2697.54s)]
*  for some of these plays and he's a 45% three-point shooter. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2699.5s)]
*  So I think you don't need to, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2703.4199999999996s)]
*  I just think when you're in a playoff series, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2704.62s)]
*  if you're running offense the way the Knicks run offense, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2706.2599999999998s)]
*  I think over the course of two weeks, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2709.06s)]
*  it gets easier and easier to at least get used to it. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2710.5s)]
*  And the more wrinkles they have, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2713.4199999999996s)]
*  I think they're a really interesting offensive team. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2714.9399999999996s)]
*  And I know some of the stats [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2716.8599999999997s)]
*  are already pretty good for them. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2717.8199999999997s)]
*  My last one, how hurt do you actually think Lebron is? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2722.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2727.22s)]
*  I mean, it was a weird part of the schedule. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2728.98s)]
*  It was gonna be really tough. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2733.58s)]
*  The time the injury happened at the end of the Celtic game [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2734.7400000000002s)]
*  and they had already lost. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2737.34s)]
*  I just thought the stuff in the state championship game, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2739.06s)]
*  like him jumping around on the sidelines, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2741.38s)]
*  by the way, smart for him to rest up [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2744.14s)]
*  and get his shit together for the playoff run. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2746.86s)]
*  But we were talking about this in these, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2749.66s)]
*  or at least the media was in these grave terms, Lebron. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2752.06s)]
*  This might be the rest of the year. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2756.26s)]
*  I think he's fine. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2757.5s)]
*  And I think the Lakers have to be taken seriously [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2759.1s)]
*  and I'm not gonna waver from that point. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2761.18s)]
*  Like they showed him shooting today, I think he's fine. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2763.2999999999997s)]
*  Would be my takeaway. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2765.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the video started going around him [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2768.8599999999997s)]
*  at the high school game and people were checking [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2771.2599999999998s)]
*  like the depth of the thigh separation. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2774.42s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2778.46s)]
*  Yeah, like that's a sturdy stance [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2779.2999999999997s)]
*  and his groin's probably in the middle. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2781.7799999999997s)]
*  But then if he goes to the workout this morning, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2783.2999999999997s)]
*  then it all kind of makes sense. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2785.22s)]
*  It's like, well, yeah, I felt good last night to celebrate. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2786.42s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't realize until the state championship. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2788.2999999999997s)]
*  I think he's fine. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2791.78s)]
*  I'm not worried about it. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2792.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2794.98s)]
*  One thing I was thinking about with the Cavs, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2797.42s)]
*  and then we'll take a break. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2801.1s)]
*  I can't believe Orlando won. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2802.3s)]
*  You wanna talk about like a game where I'm like, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2803.46s)]
*  when's this gonna be over? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2805.14s)]
*  I watched the entire game. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2805.98s)]
*  I'm sure you watched a bunch of it too. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2807.18s)]
*  I thought it was a bad loss for Cleveland [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2811.7400000000002s)]
*  because I was excited for their streak [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2813.98s)]
*  and I really wanted them to win [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2815.82s)]
*  because I was like, I love streaks. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2818.3s)]
*  Once we get over 16, I'm in. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2819.9s)]
*  You've always been a huge streak guy. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2821.42s)]
*  I didn't bet on them. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2823.06s)]
*  I just love streaks. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2823.9s)]
*  And there was some stuff in there [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2825.98s)]
*  that I just am filing away in the back of my head [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2828.1800000000003s)]
*  because I think they're really good. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2830.3s)]
*  I still think they're the favorite in the East, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2831.58s)]
*  but there's a Hunter shot at the end of the game [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2833.26s)]
*  in the corner, right? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2835.54s)]
*  Not a lot of huge, I'm gonna say the Andre Hunter [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2837.78s)]
*  hasn't been in a lot of huge games. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2840.5s)]
*  The game started to feel a little big, right? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2842.62s)]
*  The streaks on the line, they go to him. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2844.46s)]
*  He's wide open the corner, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2846.06s)]
*  it hits the side of the backboard. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2847.3s)]
*  And I was like, oh, okay. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2848.62s)]
*  Are you saying Hunter lacks seasoning? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2851.66s)]
*  Just saying, you can go into these playoffs [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2854.06s)]
*  and be 68 and 14, but they have a bunch of guys [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2857.2599999999998s)]
*  who have never really been in these massive games. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2861.2599999999998s)]
*  Like Mitchell has. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2865.54s)]
*  That Mitchell dunked today. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2867.62s)]
*  Streus has been in a couple of big games, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2869.3399999999997s)]
*  but there's some guys that haven't. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2871.74s)]
*  And sometimes when the series or the game [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2873.46s)]
*  isn't working out the way you think it is [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2876.22s)]
*  and all of a sudden you're in the corner [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2877.8999999999996s)]
*  and you're like, oh shit, I gotta make this. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2879.02s)]
*  You haven't been in that spot. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2881.06s)]
*  I don't know, I just filed it away. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2882.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you file anything away from that game? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2883.54s)]
*  Well, then I was just expecting Orlando to lose [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2886.3399999999997s)]
*  because they have become unwatchable on offense. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2888.4199999999996s)]
*  And I think it's turned into bad habit Palo [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2891.14s)]
*  where I give them a pass, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2894.74s)]
*  but I think he knows how screwed they are most nights. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2896.18s)]
*  So he goes six and 22 tonight. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2898.1s)]
*  I thought his decision's based on some [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2900.06s)]
*  of the switching matchups that he had. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2901.8199999999997s)]
*  I was like, why are you going to that? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2903.14s)]
*  But ultimately Anthony Black hits two corner threes late [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2905.22s)]
*  and you get a ball game, Orlando. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2908.2999999999997s)]
*  So this team is 32 and 37. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2909.94s)]
*  The offense, when they're bad, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2914.62s)]
*  I know we've covered it before, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2918.2999999999997s)]
*  but they shot 42% from three today. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2919.66s)]
*  Cleveland shot 25 and it still came down [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2924.06s)]
*  in the last few seconds of the game. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2926.4199999999996s)]
*  So good for Orlando. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2928.3799999999997s)]
*  So if you're Cleveland and you're just like, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2929.22s)]
*  hey, we didn't hit threes, that's why we lost. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2930.06s)]
*  Let's move on. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2932.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it's amazing to think of these two teams [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2933.22s)]
*  going to a game seven first round series last year, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2935.9399999999996s)]
*  and then just the rocket ship distance [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2938.66s)]
*  that Cleveland has gone from them. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2941.66s)]
*  We can get to the injury stuff with the record [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2942.9399999999996s)]
*  and the time Palo's missed and the time Franz has missed [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2945.4199999999996s)]
*  and that Suggs looking at the on off stuff [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2947.98s)]
*  and how important he's been, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2951.1s)]
*  but they still shouldn't, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2951.98s)]
*  since they've had everybody back during this stretch, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2954.02s)]
*  they still shouldn't be this bad offensively. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2956.14s)]
*  So this is a team I'm frustrated with that's different. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2958.62s)]
*  Phoenix, I resent the time I've spent with them. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2962.02s)]
*  You want it back. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2965.5s)]
*  Where Orlando, I still enjoy Palo and Franz [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2966.7400000000002s)]
*  when it's right so much, but yeah, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2971.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm not telling any Magic fan that's watched this. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2974.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you've watched your team go for stretches [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2976.94s)]
*  or you're worried if they're ever gonna score again [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2979.2200000000003s)]
*  in the game, that's how bad it can get. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2980.7400000000002s)]
*  It's definitely one of the higher percentages [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2982.62s)]
*  of two seconds left on the shot clock, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2985.1400000000003s)]
*  fall away 20 footer with the hand in your face. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2987.46s)]
*  They've gotta be in the top three, right? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2990.34s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2992.9s)]
*  Yeah, it was tough having this game up [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2993.7400000000002s)]
*  with Michigan and Wisconsin too. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2995.34s)]
*  The frat game, I just, you were like, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2997.58s)]
*  when is there going to be a good shot? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=2999.82s)]
*  They interviewed the guard from Michigan [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3001.78s)]
*  and he's out there just strutting. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3003.94s)]
*  It was like, I think it was two for seven. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3005.3s)]
*  The game. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3007.38s)]
*  Hey, can I ask though a quick clarification? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3008.98s)]
*  Did you take something from this Cleveland loss [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3012.9s)]
*  that infected your playoff brain? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3015.58s)]
*  Well, I did a lot of Cleveland work this morning [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3019.2200000000003s)]
*  thinking that they were gonna win this game [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3021.9s)]
*  and we would lead with the streak. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3023.46s)]
*  Here's the one thing I can't figure out. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3027.5400000000004s)]
*  Well, Mobley didn't play, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3029.9s)]
*  which we should have already mentioned. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3030.7400000000002s)]
*  I get it. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3031.86s)]
*  Guys, teams miss stuff all the time. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3033.9s)]
*  The question for me is what's your thing [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3040.1400000000003s)]
*  if you're gonna win the title, right? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3042.1000000000004s)]
*  I went back, I went through the last 10 years, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3045.38s)]
*  last year with the Celtics, what was their thing? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3048.06s)]
*  Ultimately, if you just strip it down, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3050.1s)]
*  you could describe it in five words. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3051.94s)]
*  It was like, Tatum and Brown are really good together. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3053.54s)]
*  They're durable, they play well. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3055.46s)]
*  Usually one of them is having a good game. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3057.34s)]
*  It's a really special combo. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3059.66s)]
*  And if we had to, and there's a bunch of other reasons, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3061.46s)]
*  but let's start there, that's why they won the title. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3063.9s)]
*  23, Yoke Ejimuri. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3067.22s)]
*  Really special combo. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3069.46s)]
*  Just that they hit a level, they were the best [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3070.7799999999997s)]
*  and that's why they won. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3072.98s)]
*  22, Curry, our guy. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3073.94s)]
*  21, Giannis. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3076.46s)]
*  20, LeBron and AD. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3077.5s)]
*  19. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3078.9s)]
*  And Poole. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3079.7400000000002s)]
*  And Poole. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3080.5800000000004s)]
*  19, Kawhi, just went to a great level [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3081.5s)]
*  and they had a really fun team [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3084.1000000000004s)]
*  and he was the center force. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3085.54s)]
*  Did this take a lot of time to research this? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3086.38s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3088.3s)]
*  Did not, did not take a lot of time at all. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3089.1400000000003s)]
*  Curry, Katie and Clay for two years. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3090.1000000000004s)]
*  LeBron and Kyrie, Curry and Clay, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3091.86s)]
*  that's the last 10 years. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3093.1400000000003s)]
*  The question for me was I think about [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3094.78s)]
*  could Cleveland win the title? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3096.6200000000003s)]
*  How would we talk about it after? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3098.5s)]
*  Be like, what was their thing? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3100.02s)]
*  And I think it would have to be the guards. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3102.02s)]
*  I think we would have to say, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3104.62s)]
*  you could mention all the other things, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3105.9s)]
*  but you say, man, their guards were fucking awesome. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3106.94s)]
*  That's why they won the title. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3108.94s)]
*  I don't really know what else it would be [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3112.14s)]
*  other than them shooting 50% from three [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3114.18s)]
*  for the last two rounds, something like that. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3116.66s)]
*  So I'm just trying to compare them. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3118.8199999999997s)]
*  The last team that you really left the season going, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3120.02s)]
*  man, I can't believe they got to that level [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3123.74s)]
*  was the 14 Spurs, right? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3126.5s)]
*  And they had, you're going back, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3129.54s)]
*  they had really good players, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3130.94s)]
*  but they just like, they meshed and they were awesome. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3132.02s)]
*  And it made sense. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3134.58s)]
*  And they were so mad about the year before. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3135.42s)]
*  Yeah, and they were driven, they had the hunger. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3137.54s)]
*  So with Cleveland, I think it would be the guards, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3139.78s)]
*  unless, what do you think? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3143.18s)]
*  Would it be something different? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3144.3s)]
*  If we're talking about them in July, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3145.7s)]
*  oh yeah, Cleveland, of course they won. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3147.14s)]
*  They had this, this, this. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3148.7400000000002s)]
*  What would be the first thing? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3150.14s)]
*  Well, I have to come up with something else. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3152.38s)]
*  I don't think Mobley's gonna be somebody [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3155.38s)]
*  that you're running late possessions for [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3156.82s)]
*  and having everybody space off of him. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3159.22s)]
*  His passing is really good, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3162.7400000000002s)]
*  but it might just be an adaptability, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3164.6600000000003s)]
*  which is the same thing with OKC. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3166.46s)]
*  Like you're pretty sure you know [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3168.1000000000004s)]
*  what boss is gonna run out there based on every matchup. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3169.38s)]
*  They're probably gonna run the same thing. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3173.02s)]
*  With OKC and Cleveland, I think the fun part [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3175.38s)]
*  is knowing that they can mix and match a little bit. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3177.82s)]
*  And when he closed with that Cleveland lineup, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3180.5s)]
*  he went Hunter, Mobley, and the two guards. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3183.1400000000003s)]
*  Which was, I liked it. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3186.5400000000004s)]
*  I love it. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3189.5800000000004s)]
*  I know it's kind of funny. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3190.5s)]
*  I'll never forget when Golden State beat Dirk [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3192.1s)]
*  and that Dallas team in the first round, right? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3195.06s)]
*  Who we believe. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3197.86s)]
*  And everybody on TV was killing the Mavs for adjusting. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3199.38s)]
*  It's like, you're the one seed. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3204.22s)]
*  You're supposed to make them adjust to you. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3205.22s)]
*  And I always thought it was like the dumbest thing. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3206.66s)]
*  I thought it was like so stubborn. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3208.62s)]
*  So what are you supposed to do? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3210.38s)]
*  Like just never adjust? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3211.22s)]
*  Just get annihilated every quarter? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3212.46s)]
*  We're the one seed. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3214.74s)]
*  We're not subbing bad matchups out. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3215.58s)]
*  We built this record through six months of hard work [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3218.38s)]
*  and stubbornness. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3220.6200000000003s)]
*  So I know what you're saying. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3221.5s)]
*  Could you see this all time, do they compliment each other [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3224.1800000000003s)]
*  enough through four rounds? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3228.46s)]
*  I just love that team. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3229.58s)]
*  And I don't like the default, well, the Celtics [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3230.7400000000002s)]
*  have been through the wars and Cleveland hasn't. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3234.46s)]
*  So that's why Cleveland can't beat them. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3236.78s)]
*  I don't see it that way. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3239.26s)]
*  We'll see how I feel when they're playing each other. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3241.3s)]
*  I certainly could change my mind on this, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3243.54s)]
*  but I just feel like league wide, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3245.22s)]
*  it's the most open mindedness I've had [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3247.2599999999998s)]
*  about those three teams. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3249.66s)]
*  Yeah, I would say I'm still shaded toward Cleveland [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3251.4199999999996s)]
*  in that matchup. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3253.8599999999997s)]
*  Cause the hunger piece. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3255.2999999999997s)]
*  So you have Boston third out of the hierarchy. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3256.62s)]
*  Yeah, my life depended on it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3260.06s)]
*  I would pick Cleveland, but I don't feel great about it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3261.2599999999998s)]
*  But I think they're a safer bet. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3263.8999999999996s)]
*  Like I was going through some of the stats with them [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3265.98s)]
*  and you know, first of all, they're 56 and 11, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3268.06s)]
*  which is nuts. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3273.8999999999996s)]
*  Like they still have a chance to get to 69, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3274.74s)]
*  but they're first in offense. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3277.8599999999997s)]
*  They're shooting 39% from three. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3279.54s)]
*  They have nobody over 31.3 minutes a game, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3282.3799999999997s)]
*  which is incredible. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3285.02s)]
*  They've been really fanatical about keeping everybody fresh [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3286.06s)]
*  for the playoffs, which I think is really gonna help them. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3288.9399999999996s)]
*  Hunter's at 51% from three for them, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3291.66s)]
*  but heading into today's, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3294.06s)]
*  Struz is 42 and Jerome was 44. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3295.02s)]
*  So their roll guys are showing up. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3297.1s)]
*  They have nine guys, man, that I really like. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3298.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3301.02s)]
*  That I understand what all nine guys are supposed to do. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3302.3s)]
*  And then two 15 game winning streaks in the same season, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3305.5800000000004s)]
*  fifth time it ever happened. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3308.82s)]
*  It doesn't mean you're gonna win the title, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3312.0600000000004s)]
*  but the 71 bucks and the 2000 Lakers did it. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3313.6200000000003s)]
*  97 Jazz did it, they made the finals. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3316.78s)]
*  07 Suns did it, that was the Robert Hoare year. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3319.6200000000003s)]
*  They were the second best team in the league that year. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3321.94s)]
*  And then you look at some of the historical stuff [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3324.5400000000004s)]
*  with like teams that won 68 games, four titles, two failures. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3327.34s)]
*  67 wins, nine titles, four failures. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3333.26s)]
*  66 wins, 12 titles, five failures. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3335.34s)]
*  The odds are like, if they win 66, 67, 68 games, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3338.1800000000003s)]
*  the odds are they're gonna make finals. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3342.0600000000004s)]
*  We talked about this last year with the Celtics. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3343.98s)]
*  Like you can pick them apart, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3345.78s)]
*  say they shoot too many threes. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3347.26s)]
*  The math is saying they're going to make the finals [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3348.98s)]
*  and they're gonna beat Dallas. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3351.34s)]
*  And you can either trust the math or not. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3352.38s)]
*  With Cleveland, there's a lot of math in their favor [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3354.5400000000004s)]
*  if they can finish the season strong. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3356.6600000000003s)]
*  But they have a tough schedule. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3358.26s)]
*  They still have like eight road games left. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3359.82s)]
*  So they might drop, they might end up in the mid-60s. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3361.38s)]
*  I personally think, Rosillo, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3364.1s)]
*  like OKC to me makes much more sense [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3366.54s)]
*  of us talking about them in July and be like, holy shit. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3369.82s)]
*  SGA, nobody could guard them all year. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3373.6600000000003s)]
*  That team could go big, they could go small. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3375.82s)]
*  They were deep, they were incredible defensively. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3378.1800000000003s)]
*  The coach is great, they had home court the whole time. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3380.5s)]
*  It makes sense to me why they won the title. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3383.7000000000003s)]
*  Cleveland, I'm having a tougher time envisioning it. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3385.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because there's no Boston in the West, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3389.2200000000003s)]
*  which is why the fan dual odds. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3390.7400000000002s)]
*  I think it's still plus 185, plus 185, Boston OKC. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3391.9s)]
*  And then since we talked about Cleveland the first time [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3395.42s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago, it's gone from plus 700 to plus 500. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3397.5s)]
*  That's simply because there's just another team. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3399.94s)]
*  And as we keep talking about this West, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3402.7000000000003s)]
*  like good luck figuring out how those standards are gonna go. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3404.26s)]
*  And I think it was great to bring up some of the Denver thing [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3406.6600000000003s)]
*  because I would imagine like people are gonna start getting [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3409.0600000000004s)]
*  on that a little bit more where there's just default of Jokic, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3411.3s)]
*  he'll figure it out. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3414.1400000000003s)]
*  And it's like, man, but you know, again, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3415.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know that it's ever fair to really judge them [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3417.5s)]
*  unless you get like a nice runway of Aaron Gordon games [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3419.1800000000003s)]
*  because I think he's just incredibly important. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3421.3s)]
*  He might be, well, I can't say he's the second most important [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3423.0200000000004s)]
*  guy because of Jamal, but he's definitely the third most [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3425.0600000000004s)]
*  important player on a team here that you still have [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3426.7000000000003s)]
*  expectations for. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3428.86s)]
*  But couldn't you look at the history too on some of the point [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3429.78s)]
*  differential stuff, the defensive differential stuff, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3433.1800000000003s)]
*  like OKC and actually Cleveland have these similar profiles [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3435.34s)]
*  where, because I did the Cleveland thing a couple of weeks ago [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3440.78s)]
*  when I did that disastrous 15 teams in 45 minutes [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3444.0200000000004s)]
*  with the East, and this was 15. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3446.62s)]
*  But I just kept trying to find something on offense [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3449.06s)]
*  that Cleveland was bad at statistically. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3452.46s)]
*  Like, hey, catch and shoot this, pick and roll ball [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3455.5s)]
*  hander this, pick and roll, roll man this. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3458.2599999999998s)]
*  Those things, all these, every single number, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3460.3399999999997s)]
*  like the only one I found was like 15th in the NBA. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3463.06s)]
*  Out of all the different things you could sort and try to [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3465.7s)]
*  figure out what it was, because everything else was like [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3468.02s)]
*  first or second, they're just that good. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3470.38s)]
*  But it's also happening on the point differential thing. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3473.02s)]
*  When you look at that, it comes up, speaking to the Boston [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3475.42s)]
*  number that you talked about last year, it's like, hey, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3478.1s)]
*  these teams, when they have this, they'll win a title [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3480.1800000000003s)]
*  and we have two kind of at the same time, right? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3483.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3485.46s)]
*  And then you have a Celtics team that I think has been [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3486.3s)]
*  really careful about the regular season [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3488.94s)]
*  because the last season. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3490.62s)]
*  And one of the things I think that's been so great, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3493.02s)]
*  I love the Tatum season, like just A+, positive reviews, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3495.3s)]
*  five stars, I'll do the tit, like whatever. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3500.38s)]
*  This would be a wine bottle season potentially. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3503.66s)]
*  Might be, could be. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3506.06s)]
*  Could be breaking out the Cabernet for him, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3507.14s)]
*  the Tatum, 25 Tatum Cabernet. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3509.18s)]
*  They've done five times this year where they're just like, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3513.74s)]
*  Jason, we're just gonna play a bunch of those, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3516.94s)]
*  like Bailey Shireman's gonna play today. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3520.8199999999997s)]
*  Is that cool? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3523.62s)]
*  They can give us like 35 minutes. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3524.46s)]
*  Just the two of your teammates at all times are gonna be guys [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3526.98s)]
*  who are usually in the G League, but we're gonna try to be [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3530.66s)]
*  Brooklyn anyway, are you cool? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3533.94s)]
*  We'll just run, just don't get hurt, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3534.78s)]
*  but also play really hard. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3535.9s)]
*  And he just, he does everything. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3537.1800000000003s)]
*  I think his defense has been great. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3539.1800000000003s)]
*  And Giannis has really come on too, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3541.46s)]
*  and I think that's a good argument, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3543.26s)]
*  Giannis or Tatum for the number three for MVP. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3544.5800000000004s)]
*  But the top four that we have this year, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3547.3s)]
*  I think has been pretty awesome. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3549.7000000000003s)]
*  And then Mitchell, I think is a good fifth choice too. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3552.54s)]
*  Yeah, they had to play, what, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3555.3s)]
*  Perzingis 32 minutes last night as they held off that [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3556.54s)]
*  late Brooklyn rally. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3559.86s)]
*  And I wanna watch that game. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3561.5800000000004s)]
*  Because I was really into the schedule last night, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3562.74s)]
*  just because the, not just because of the Sunday pod, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3564.7s)]
*  there was just a lot of different stuff. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3566.8999999999996s)]
*  I wanna see what Perzingis look like coming back. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3567.8999999999996s)]
*  And then they ended up having to leave them out there [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3569.98s)]
*  for a good chunk of it. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3571.62s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I can totally see a version of this too, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3572.8199999999997s)]
*  as much as I love Cleveland. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3576.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think it's kind of surprising that both of us [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3577.58s)]
*  kind of leaning towards, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3579.18s)]
*  we feel like we pick them right now against Boston. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3580.02s)]
*  That the funny like, and I still don't know [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3582.4199999999996s)]
*  what I'm actually gonna think [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3586.58s)]
*  when they're facing each other, right? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3587.5s)]
*  How they're gonna look to the first couple rounds [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3589.3799999999997s)]
*  of playoffs. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3590.7s)]
*  I can totally see myself change my mind on it. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3592.02s)]
*  I just don't know how you watch Cleveland [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3595.62s)]
*  these last couple of months and be like, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3596.86s)]
*  no, I'm picking somebody else. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3597.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3599.9s)]
*  But I think I know what'll happen. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3600.74s)]
*  It'll be, hey, the guard still got stuck between, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3602.3s)]
*  whatever version of Drew you're gonna see, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3607.02s)]
*  you hope that's a bit ramped up in the playoffs, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3608.98s)]
*  or it would be by then. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3611.02s)]
*  He'd just be better. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3612.02s)]
*  Because I think it's kind of hit or miss right now. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3613.18s)]
*  But it's, hey, look, those four perimeter guys out there [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3615.14s)]
*  with a spacing big that took away whatever big [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3618.54s)]
*  they wanted to keep out there. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3620.9s)]
*  Or the times where Tatum gets on Allen, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3622.1400000000003s)]
*  and he's actually beating Allen off the dribble. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3624.5s)]
*  It's like, hey, cool De'Andre Hunter trade, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3626.26s)]
*  but they still got caught up in way too many mismatches [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3629.98s)]
*  on the perimeter. Right. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3632.9s)]
*  And those guys were just too small. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3634.02s)]
*  It was, there were too many times where it was Garland [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3635.6600000000003s)]
*  and Mitchell having to go up against these other dudes [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3638.6200000000003s)]
*  with the ball in their hands, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3641.58s)]
*  which is why I would have never ever picked him. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3642.42s)]
*  And I think that maybe I'm overrating the Hunter part of it, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3644.1s)]
*  but that would be what it is. You're not. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3646.58s)]
*  You're properly rating it. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3648.3s)]
*  So there's another piece that I can't shake [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3649.9s)]
*  is the hunger piece of it. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3651.94s)]
*  The Celtics having already won and Cleveland never winning. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3653.54s)]
*  There was John Krasinski who writes for the athletic. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3655.94s)]
*  Who's in the office. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3659.58s)]
*  Covers Timberwolves, different one. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3660.42s)]
*  But he led a thing, he wrote about Minnesota [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3663.42s)]
*  and Denver this week. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3665.94s)]
*  John's awesome by the way, so I should have made that. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3666.78s)]
*  He's one of my favorites. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3668.54s)]
*  No, no, we both like him. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3669.82s)]
*  This was his first two paragraphs. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3671.42s)]
*  He said, long after the Timberwolves had vanquished [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3674.54s)]
*  the defending champion Denver Nuggets on their home floor [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3676.58s)]
*  in game seven of the Western Conference semifinals [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3678.58s)]
*  last season, a Nuggets official emerged from the locker room [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3680.54s)]
*  and started walking down the hallway of the parking lot. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3683.74s)]
*  They remind me a lot of us last year. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3686.34s)]
*  He said, shaking his head. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3688.2599999999998s)]
*  They just wanted it so damn bad. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3689.58s)]
*  We couldn't match it. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3691.42s)]
*  I think that's like the number one thing to think about [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3693.18s)]
*  when we go into playoffs. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3695.3s)]
*  I think OKC and Cleveland are gonna be maniacs [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3697.22s)]
*  because they've never won. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3701.66s)]
*  You know, and if you're the Celtics, you won last year. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3702.9s)]
*  There's this extra gear you have to have [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3705.46s)]
*  when you're going back to back. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3707.06s)]
*  You have to be able to match [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3708.98s)]
*  whatever that other team is bringing. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3711.02s)]
*  That's like all I want. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3712.66s)]
*  Like it's like the Eagles Chiefs Super Bowl. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3713.74s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3716.14s)]
*  The Eagles just wanted it more than the Chiefs. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3717.34s)]
*  Now they were better. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3719.14s)]
*  There are all these other reasons, but ultimately [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3719.98s)]
*  that was a way bigger game for them [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3721.78s)]
*  because the Chiefs had already won. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3723.14s)]
*  And I just keep thinking about that with these playoffs. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3724.82s)]
*  I was thinking about it Wednesday night [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3726.74s)]
*  watching OKC play the Celtics. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3727.94s)]
*  The Celtics kept trying to match the intensity of the game [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3730.46s)]
*  and OKC just was like hungrier. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3732.98s)]
*  I think SGA is like a fuck. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3735.46s)]
*  He's fucking on a mission. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3737.06s)]
*  Have you seen that guy play a bad game? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3739.06s)]
*  Does that guy ever suck anymore? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3741.5s)]
*  He's unbelievable. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3746.14s)]
*  I know that you can go back to the Knicks series stuff [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3748.02s)]
*  or some times where, you know, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3751.18s)]
*  I think it's being a little too critical. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3754.66s)]
*  You're trying to have me come up with an answer. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3756.82s)]
*  I can point to a series a couple of years ago, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3759.18s)]
*  but I mean, this dude's played, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3760.98s)]
*  he's played in 54 playoff games. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3762.62s)]
*  He's never played in more than 11. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3765.58s)]
*  And that was actually that first year when they beat, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3767.66s)]
*  I think that first year they beat the Oklahoma City Thunder [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3771.54s)]
*  in the first round. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3774.7s)]
*  They lost to the Rockets the second round. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3775.54s)]
*  Who are you talking about? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3776.38s)]
*  Mitchell, he's played 54 playoff games. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3777.7799999999997s)]
*  The guy averaged 28 a game in the playoffs. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3779.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, he averaged 36 a game. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3782.54s)]
*  The third year he was with Utah in the playoffs [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3784.58s)]
*  when they had that awesome Phoenix series. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3787.06s)]
*  We both think he could be the best guy on a title team. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3788.9s)]
*  Denver, I always say Phoenix. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3790.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was the Denver series. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3791.42s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3792.86s)]
*  I don't have anything negative to say. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3796.1s)]
*  I don't have anything negative to say about any of those teams. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3797.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know how, I have no idea of sitting here, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3799.02s)]
*  not being around either teams day to day [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3802.1800000000003s)]
*  of understanding the pride of the champ [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3804.26s)]
*  versus the hunger of the challenger. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3808.86s)]
*  I don't know how anybody could come up with it. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3811.26s)]
*  I think it's really hard to win back to back. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3814.06s)]
*  That's my biggest favorite with the Celts. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3815.78s)]

*  So I'll just give you by record in descending order. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3870.54s)]
*  Best third guys, Darius Garland, Chet Holmgren, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3873.98s)]
*  Derek White, Van Vliet, Desmond Bain, Austin Reeves, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3878.26s)]
*  Aaron Gordon, Draymond, Pickenick, Brooke Lopez, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3882.1s)]
*  Nasrid, Zubach, Miles Turner. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3885.66s)]
*  Who is the best third guy in the league? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3889.06s)]
*  Because I think you could make a real case that Holmgren. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3892.58s)]
*  I can't believe how good Holmgren is. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3896.14s)]
*  If he's healthy, I can't believe how good he is. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3898.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think I'd have to see. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3901.86s)]
*  I'm with you, but I think you'd have to see just maybe [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3905.3399999999997s)]
*  two straight months of it. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3907.58s)]
*  Fair. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3909.58s)]
*  Fair. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3911.2599999999998s)]
*  Ron Holland is not on this. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3911.8599999999997s)]
*  Let me add him. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3914.46s)]
*  Did he did he get in a fight in the last four days? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3919.4199999999996s)]
*  Did he have to be separated from anybody? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3921.8599999999997s)]
*  No, but that whole Pistons thing last night, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3923.54s)]
*  it kind of started with him. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3925.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3928.22s)]
*  Which I know no one's going to believe me on. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3928.54s)]
*  Do you want to do two minutes on the Pistons and Vickers Staple? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3930.94s)]
*  Nothing would make me happier. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3933.5800000000004s)]
*  I was so excited to watch that game last night. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3934.94s)]
*  OKC in Detroit and. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3936.78s)]
*  Cade was struggling a bit. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3940.2200000000003s)]
*  Cade had a rough game until he got kicked out. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3944.6200000000003s)]
*  Wasn't great for him. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3946.94s)]
*  And so there was a play where Dort was going to set a screen [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3948.0200000000004s)]
*  and Holland embellished it and. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3952.1000000000004s)]
*  Holland got the call. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3956.46s)]
*  He got the foul on Dort. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3957.38s)]
*  So now you're like, Dort's going to be looking for it. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3959.1400000000003s)]
*  So not that far after. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3961.82s)]
*  There was also a play earlier where it looked like Jayden Williams [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3963.1400000000003s)]
*  and Isaiah Stewart went to kill each other in the paint [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3965.98s)]
*  with just elbow box out shit. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3969.02s)]
*  So like whenever I see an Isaiah Stewart altercation, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3972.1800000000003s)]
*  I rewind four possessions to try to find what's happened. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3975.5s)]
*  He's like lamb beer. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3979.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3980.46s)]
*  But it's like the seeds to the altercation. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3980.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3983.06s)]
*  Anybody that's ever watched Hoops, like you just know, like, OK, wait a minute. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3983.26s)]
*  Like if I'm late on a game, I'm like something else already happened. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3986.42s)]
*  Let me go back and check this. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3989.98s)]
*  Although Plumlee and Adams had a good one the other night [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3991.7400000000002s)]
*  when the funny thing is, is Adams is in the middle of an assault [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3993.94s)]
*  with a seven footer and he's smiling the whole time. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3996.6200000000003s)]
*  So I can't tell what's scarier that Plumlee like wanted to go [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=3999.9s)]
*  and his forehead was bleeding or that Adams was completely unfazed [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4003.2200000000003s)]
*  is laughing about it two seconds later. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4007.86s)]
*  That might be more horrifying. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4010.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't think he gets enough credit in these scariest guys [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4012.06s)]
*  of the century ranking, Steven Adams, because when he had like 17 brothers [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4015.2200000000003s)]
*  and sisters, he was clearly in seven million fights. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4018.82s)]
*  He's from New Zealand. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4021.82s)]
*  I don't feel like there's any NBA altercation on a basketball court [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4023.1400000000003s)]
*  that he would even like break a drop of sweat to be involved in. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4026.1800000000003s)]
*  Like he could have been in the air test melee smiling as people were [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4030.38s)]
*  from climbing over the ropes. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4033.26s)]
*  But remember how mad I got at him during that OKC Houston [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4034.78s)]
*  playoff series, and that had a lot to do with Chris Paul going up against Harden. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4038.82s)]
*  And I was so upset that P.J. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4043.0600000000004s)]
*  Tucker's playing center. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4044.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm like, how can Steven Adams not? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4045.86s)]
*  And I was like, I'm questioning his toughness. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4047.98s)]
*  And it was like the lead on the six o'clock news in Auckland. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4049.5s)]
*  So I remember that the New Zealand people, because they're mostly with us. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4052.18s)]
*  But they it'll be a new story right now in New Zealand that we're even talking about. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4055.98s)]
*  They love all Steven Adams conversations. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4060.42s)]
*  Right. I was like, how can he be the scariest guy? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4062.38s)]
*  And then when he gets an offensive rebound, he can't just turn around [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4064.46s)]
*  from two feet out with a six foot seven center behind him. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4067.3s)]
*  So is there part of that going to the equation? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4069.86s)]
*  Probably not on the like he might be so good at altercations, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4071.7400000000002s)]
*  the physical part of it that it bores him. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4074.78s)]
*  And that's why he was laughing. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4076.34s)]
*  Although, again, it's still another seven footer in an athletic guy in Plumlee. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4077.9s)]
*  But anyway, back to the so Stuart and Jalen Williams to have a thing. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4080.78s)]
*  Holland sells the call door, then gets him right back where he embellishes it. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4086.42s)]
*  Then he gets the call. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4092.38s)]
*  Then you have the door groin thing where he actually stepped on SGA's ankle. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4093.82s)]
*  So at this point, Bickerstaff is really mad about the Holland thing, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4097.860000000001s)]
*  whereas any coach or any competitor, he's completely ignoring that his guy got one [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4101.06s)]
*  just a couple of possessions ago. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4105.5s)]
*  All right. Then they review it because Stewart actually threw Jalen Williams [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4106.86s)]
*  to out of the way on a box out, but then they didn't care about it. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4111.42s)]
*  That it wasn't a hostile act. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4115.98s)]
*  And then obviously, the door part wasn't a hostile act. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4117.18s)]
*  And Bickerstaff was upset about the Holland part of that call. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4119.34s)]
*  He was also upset because he said all this in the presser. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4123.86s)]
*  He was you. I could watch it. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4126.42s)]
*  I could see like him just he was getting to a point. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4127.66s)]
*  But you know what? He was really he was also getting to a point [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4130.02s)]
*  where he was only seeing the shit that was happening, his team, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4132.820000000001s)]
*  which is the most human nature thing ever. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4135.780000000001s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4138.58s)]
*  Or excuse me, I don't know why Chad got thrown out. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4139.58s)]
*  I was watching Cade. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4142.26s)]
*  Chad is Chad or Chad. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4144.06s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why any of those three guys got thrown out. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4146.1s)]
*  I don't know why Cade got thrown out. I watched it. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4148.860000000001s)]
*  It seemed like he got his technical and then kind of wouldn't let it go. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4151.58s)]
*  But I don't know what he was like. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4154.900000000001s)]
*  Clearly, it was enough that the rest were over it. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4155.780000000001s)]
*  And at that point, I think another thing I've spent too long on this [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4158.1s)]
*  SGA is so incredibly frustrating. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4161.42s)]
*  And yes, there's that layer of bullshit with him that's not as bad as the other guys. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4164.820000000001s)]
*  All bullshit, all NBA for he's not he may be second team. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4168.9800000000005s)]
*  But it just gets so frustrating that it's this boiling point. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4172.900000000001s)]
*  And then bigger staff just like basically, I'm going to stick up for my guys here tonight. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4176.1s)]
*  But I thought he was also ignoring some of the stuff that was going their way to. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4179.06s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4184.5s)]
*  I have a couple of thoughts. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4186.5s)]
*  I don't think I think when you're throwing out somebody out of a game, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4190.02s)]
*  you have to factor in with the reputation is day to day, week to week as a player. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4193.700000000001s)]
*  And Cade's not a guy who gets technicals, gets thrown out of games. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4198.740000000001s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're right. You can't you can't throw them out. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4201.860000000001s)]
*  Just like I don't think they would throw LeBron out in that situation. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4204.900000000001s)]
*  Like, there's just certain guys you got to whereas like if it was Draymond, I get it. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4207.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but Draymond actually doesn't get thrown out. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4213.14s)]
*  Like if Draymond was doing what Cade was doing last night. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4215.14s)]
*  I don't know why the hell I called him Chad is going to bug me for the rest of the night. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4217.94s)]
*  Draymond doesn't get thrown out. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4222.339999999999s)]
*  Like he's he's allowed to do whatever he wants. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4224.259999999999s)]
*  Just like Cade, I thought that was an awesome game. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4226.66s)]
*  You're in Detroit. You've got a great crowd. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4228.98s)]
*  It was a good battle. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4232.82s)]
*  Like I just I'm not throwing guys out of that game if I don't have to. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4234.179999999999s)]
*  It was a bad job by the refs. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4237.219999999999s)]
*  I thought Vicar Staff should have been mad, but I think you're right. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4238.419999999999s)]
*  I think you hit on something with the SGA thing. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4241.139999999999s)]
*  He is like trying to wrestle a fucking shark in a boat. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4243.700000000001s)]
*  Like it was like he did a couple moves last night. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4248.580000000001s)]
*  There was there. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4253.54s)]
*  Well, first of all, it seemed like he might have shoved off, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4254.42s)]
*  but the guy went like 10 feet backwards. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4256.580000000001s)]
*  But he had another move where he dusted somebody on that yo-yo move he does. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4258.34s)]
*  And then just went right in the lane and there was a center waiting for him. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4262.580000000001s)]
*  And he went into the guy, held it, whipped it left handed. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4265.9400000000005s)]
*  It went in. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4269.3s)]
*  He's doing shit night to night now. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4270.18s)]
*  That's at the highest possible offensive level that I've seen from a guard. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4271.860000000001s)]
*  And it's night after night after night now. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4276.1s)]
*  He had two moves last night where I was surprised that he did them [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4278.900000000001s)]
*  because I had he had this spindribble back into the paint [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4282.42s)]
*  where he was still totally in control. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4286.900000000001s)]
*  And that was always the first thing with him. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4288.740000000001s)]
*  Just watching it wasn't that he was Westbrook like bounce. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4290.34s)]
*  It wasn't that it was the D Rose change of direction with him. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4293.9400000000005s)]
*  It's just that he's this figure skater out in the court. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4296.58s)]
*  Perky jerky shit. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4299.22s)]
*  Full speed stop. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4300.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4301.860000000001s)]
*  Stop. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4302.02s)]
*  Come backwards. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4302.42s)]
*  He had two moves that I don't remember seeing him have before. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4303.38s)]
*  Is he the number one guy that when they talk about breaking ankles, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4308.740000000001s)]
*  if somebody actually broke their ankles defending somebody, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4313.22s)]
*  he would be like a minus 800 favorite on fan build. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4315.9400000000005s)]
*  He'd be the ankle breaker guy. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4318.740000000001s)]
*  Guys fly backwards. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4320.58s)]
*  Guys try to stop. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4322.66s)]
*  He just like completely embarrasses. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4324.18s)]
*  And he's embarrassing good defenders. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4326.02s)]
*  Like pick a guard in the league. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4328.660000000001s)]
*  He does that yo-yo thing and it just works. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4330.740000000001s)]
*  I think he's peak of his powers right now. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4332.900000000001s)]
*  I know bigger staff also pointed to how mad he was that they didn't review. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4335.38s)]
*  And it was like a respect thing. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4339.46s)]
*  Like, hey, they're disrespecting us. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4340.740000000001s)]
*  And I get where he's coming from. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4342.5s)]
*  But I mean, Detroit also fouls, I think, the fifth highest rate of any team in the league this year. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4344.580000000001s)]
*  And there were possessions at the end. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4348.660000000001s)]
*  Super physical. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4349.860000000001s)]
*  With Thompson getting in the mix and Schroeder getting in the mix. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4350.660000000001s)]
*  I couldn't believe they actually weren't calling fouls. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4355.22s)]
*  I'll watch some guys with SGA 30 feet away from the hoop. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4357.3s)]
*  And Thompson comes in and you're like, why are you sticking your arms inside of his arm? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4360.18s)]
*  He's just going to get you. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4367.62s)]
*  I mean, shit, if he was doing that to Dame, Dame would have just pulled up and then got pissed at the ref being like, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4369.62s)]
*  you didn't think I was really trying to shoot from 38 feet? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4373.54s)]
*  I think you would have. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4376.5s)]
*  I think if you were a head coach, I think you would have been a great every once in a while press conference [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4377.54s)]
*  killing the ref, sticking up for your guys guy. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4384.34s)]
*  Wouldn't happen often, maybe twice a year. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4387.54s)]
*  But I think I could have totally seen you doing the press conference last night like JB did. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4389.78s)]
*  Bang the table at the end, storm out. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4394.58s)]
*  I feel like you could have done it. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4396.66s)]
*  I would have been more like the quiet sarcastic. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4398.02s)]
*  I can't believe you threw me out for that just because I made 14 barbs in a row under my breath. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4401.22s)]
*  You would have done like a Stan Van Gundy routine. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4406.1s)]
*  I'm getting thrown out for that just because I called you a dumb motherfucker under my breath 10 times as you ran by. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4409.3s)]
*  And then you finally got mad and threw me out. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4414.18s)]
*  What? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4415.860000000001s)]
*  What did I do? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4416.66s)]
*  That would have been my move. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4417.94s)]
*  When we had tied Jerome on, I was talking about him getting calls, right? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4419.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4422.82s)]
*  And we started talking about like the working of the officials and everything. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4423.139999999999s)]
*  And he just basically said what you would expect of anybody when they're out there is they kind of lose their minds. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4426.34s)]
*  It's like being a high school kid in the woods and the cops show up and they're like, what are you doing? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4430.66s)]
*  And you go nothing. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4434.18s)]
*  You know, like as if the cops like, oh, okay, we'll leave then, you know, and your first thing when you watch these guys spaz out about the calls. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4436.74s)]
*  And, you know, look, I don't really love it, but I also kind of just have to accept what is in tie was just going, dude, I can't help myself sometimes. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4446.82s)]
*  He's like, I can't help myself. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4453.54s)]
*  Like he's like, I'll pitch and I'll complain because then I'll see it. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4455.3s)]
*  I'll feel bad. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4458.34s)]
*  But like in that moment, I don't even realize what I'm doing. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4459.139999999999s)]
*  And I just don't know. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4462.9s)]
*  Like if I were a coach, it was kind of funny, too, because we had Will Hardy on. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4464.74s)]
*  I was like, did you have a moment where you're like, hey, I'm a head coach. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4468.18s)]
*  Like I get to I should argue one of these calls soon because some of these guys can't. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4470.18s)]
*  Stop. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4476.98s)]
*  They can't. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4477.54s)]
*  There's nothing that's not their possession. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4478.18s)]
*  There's never a moment. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4480.66s)]
*  Like they cannot like whatever it is that competitive moment when you're in there. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4481.86s)]
*  So I would think it'd be such a waste of energy to just keep working the officials the entire time, but I don't think they can do it. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4486.0199999999995s)]
*  Like I'll give you one other example. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4492.34s)]
*  The second time you can play St. John's this year, Danny Hurley, who's, you know, just a maniac the entire game. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4493.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4500.82s)]
*  There was some kind of tie up, and I think it was a possession, but it was possession, Yukon. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4501.46s)]
*  And they were going to inbound it from the side. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4507.06s)]
*  And he argued that they were inbounding it from the wrong spot. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4509.54s)]
*  But that would have meant his team was inbounding on their own end at the baseline, which is a way harder inbounds. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4512.5s)]
*  Like you would never prefer to be inbounding it from the baseline corner. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4517.54s)]
*  It's just a harder place to inbound it. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4521.7s)]
*  And yet Danny was he couldn't pass up the argument. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4523.22s)]
*  He was right. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4526.66s)]
*  So I don't have I don't know if I have this right. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4528.02s)]
*  But like, I want to ask him, were you so incensed in that moment that they were wrong that you actually argued something that was like a negative for you guys on the inbounds? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4529.94s)]
*  And that's what I think we watch. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4539.379999999999s)]
*  We watch these guys and they only see when it's happening to them. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4540.58s)]
*  They think they're getting screwed for two and a half hours. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4543.7s)]
*  And I like to try to accept the human nature part of it. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4546.099999999999s)]
*  But sometimes you're just like, dude, you're not paying any attention to the stuff that's actually going your way. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4548.66s)]
*  But against SGA, no one ever gets done with one of those games because he is pushing off. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4553.54s)]
*  He is grabbing with the arms. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4558.66s)]
*  Again, I don't think it's as bad as like the first round draft picks, the guys that bullshit their way through a game who, you know, like there's certain players. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4560.0199999999995s)]
*  If everybody played that way, the ratings would be zero. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4566.42s)]
*  But I don't know that anybody I don't think a coach can actually watch a game and go, you know, we've gotten a few calls here tonight. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4569.46s)]
*  I don't think they can do it. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4576.58s)]
*  I was trying to think of as you were talking, I was trying to think of like that coach referee relationship or player referee relationship. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4579.62s)]
*  And it's the thing I think as both you and I got to know people in the league better and just get under the hood a little bit. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4586.66s)]
*  And it's so fascinating which guys hate other guys. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4592.66s)]
*  And just certain coaches have certain refs that they just detest. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4595.38s)]
*  And the ref knows they're detested. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4601.0599999999995s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, Tuesday night, we got this guy. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4603.7s)]
*  Fucking, fucking hate this guy. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4606.26s)]
*  You know, and this is a huge part of the league. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4607.94s)]
*  Or, you know, it came out a little bit with the Chris Paul Scott Foster stuff. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4610.0199999999995s)]
*  But every player has one or two people that they just see and like, ah, this fucking guy. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4613.06s)]
*  And I wonder like, OKC, part of their magic. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4619.14s)]
*  SGA doesn't talk any shit at all. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4621.620000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4624.34s)]
*  He just does his job, keeps his head down. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4624.660000000001s)]
*  Dagnaut, I think, argues with the refs, probably the least of any coach. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4626.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if I'd say the least. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4632.740000000001s)]
*  When he gets hot, though, he can get really hot. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4634.900000000001s)]
*  But it's only a handful of times. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4637.38s)]
*  Mazula will get after it every once in a while. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4640.98s)]
*  And especially if you've sat close to the Celtic game, he's doing a lot of stealth. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4644.66s)]
*  Like he's he's riding refs left and right. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4648.179999999999s)]
*  You can't. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4650.5s)]
*  Some of the better coaches are really good at not having it seem like on TV, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4651.299999999999s)]
*  like they're riding the guys, because that's what the refs hate. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4655.299999999999s)]
*  They don't want to be they don't want to be embarrassed. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4658.5s)]
*  They don't want to look like they're taking shit. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4660.5s)]
*  So sometimes you'll see like, Kerr is really good at it. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4662.339999999999s)]
*  He'll walk over to a ref and it'll seem like he's talking to the guy and really considerate. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4665.379999999999s)]
*  But he learned this from Popovich. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4670.26s)]
*  He'll come over and be like, hey, you realize you fucking suck, right? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4672.26s)]
*  That was the worst fucking call ever. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4676.34s)]
*  It's a smile on your face. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4677.9400000000005s)]
*  And it does. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4679.780000000001s)]
*  It seems like they're just talking, but he's like laying into the guy. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4680.42s)]
*  But he also can become unhinged. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4683.46s)]
*  Like Kerr will have an unhinged moment. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4685.62s)]
*  Because he's a former player. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4687.54s)]
*  The former players. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4688.58s)]
*  Redick does this now, too. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4689.860000000001s)]
*  Redick will just lose it every once in a while. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4691.06s)]
*  Redick. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4693.22s)]
*  And with him, you're like, are you going to cross? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4693.860000000001s)]
*  Because he gets so incredibly intense. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4695.9400000000005s)]
*  Which is surprising. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4698.34s)]
*  Because Redick was the kind of guy in first take when it started going in a direction [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4699.54s)]
*  he didn't want. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4704.26s)]
*  He wasn't going to be like, hey, let's just all have fun. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4704.98s)]
*  We're on TV. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4708.42s)]
*  He's like, you're a fucking moron and you shouldn't be on TV. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4709.22s)]
*  You're like, fuck this shit. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4712.5s)]
*  Let's go to commercial. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4713.7s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4714.74s)]
*  No, that's a good question. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4717.3s)]
*  Because like, Doc, I remember you can ask him about this next time you have him on. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4718.18s)]
*  Well, Bill Kennedy was the guy that he... [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4723.22s)]
*  Him and Bill Kennedy, like they literally hated each other. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4725.3s)]
*  OK, but the thing was with Doc, and he would admit it. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4728.34s)]
*  Like I asked him once, I was like, do you ever think about how much you work the refs? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4731.14s)]
*  He's like, I complain too much. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4735.3s)]
*  He's like, I complain way too much. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4736.82s)]
*  And it's from the initial tip. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4738.34s)]
*  It's just on. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4741.06s)]
*  And when those Clippers teams had Chris Paul, Blake, Deandre Jordan, and then Austin Rivers [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4742.18s)]
*  was like, fuck it. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4747.14s)]
*  I'm in the mix. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4747.9400000000005s)]
*  Those guys just hammered refs the entire time. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4748.74s)]
*  And that's where I think... [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4752.66s)]
*  But if you're the ref, you're refing the Clippers and you're like, fuck. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4753.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4756.26s)]
*  I hate these guys. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4756.82s)]
*  That's where I'm like, I understand the working the refs. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4758.42s)]
*  Like you can't just be quiet the whole time. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4762.5s)]
*  But I think there's this element of like you've expended so much energy into this. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4764.58s)]
*  And now every one of your players is thinking about the refs because our guy, our head coach, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4768.58s)]
*  all he's doing is thinking about the refs. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4772.98s)]
*  And there's a point of absolute diminishing returns where it just may come back to like [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4775.139999999999s)]
*  the guy cannot help himself. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4780.5s)]
*  There's too many guys that can't help themselves. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4781.94s)]
*  I would think the best way to go about it is to like lay out, to be really picture [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4783.38s)]
*  spots. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4788.26s)]
*  Like Steven, Steven used to do that. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4788.42s)]
*  Steven's was always the most mellow and just had that kind of calm demeanor. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4789.46s)]
*  But you know another thing they... [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4794.900000000001s)]
*  So Tatum, I think Tatum's one of the... [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4796.34s)]
*  Like Tatum is just a great guy. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4799.14s)]
*  He's a good role model. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4802.74s)]
*  Tatum's approval rating right now has never been... [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4803.06s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4805.3s)]
*  He's just a good guy. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4805.78s)]
*  But Tatum does like three, four terrible, stupid things with refs that he can't stop [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4807.54s)]
*  doing. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4812.98s)]
*  He does the wave. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4813.7s)]
*  You do that, you don't get the call on your way back and you do the fuck you wave. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4815.379999999999s)]
*  That's a technical. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4819.219999999999s)]
*  You're just getting a technical for that. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4820.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4821.78s)]
*  It's not even like... [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4822.339999999999s)]
*  You might as well go toward them and like shake your fist or something. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4823.459999999999s)]
*  But he does this passive aggressive stuff, which I think they hate even more. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4826.58s)]
*  Like fuck you. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4830.82s)]
*  I'm teeing you up for that. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4831.78s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4832.98s)]
*  How dare you wave at me? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4833.7s)]
*  But the best one I ever saw going to games over the years was dealing with the refs. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4836.259999999999s)]
*  It was Jordan. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4840.339999999999s)]
*  But I think there was so much star power with Jordan. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4840.98s)]
*  I almost feel like this helps the goat case if you're talking goats. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4844.099999999999s)]
*  The way the refs were just in his pocket. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4847.94s)]
*  And I'm not talking about him getting calls. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4852.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm talking about like during the dead spots when people are shooting free throws before [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4853.78s)]
*  the game. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4857.7s)]
*  These guys treated him like, you know, it was like Beyonce walking on stage and they [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4858.58s)]
*  were like in the Bayhive. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4863.459999999999s)]
*  You know, they just... [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4865.62s)]
*  It was especially the last three years after he came back. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4866.98s)]
*  He just had a command of the fans, the refs, the room. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4870.74s)]
*  He got every call he wanted. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4874.82s)]
*  If he was upset at a call, he could say whatever he wanted. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4876.259999999999s)]
*  If he was yelling at a ref, the ref was like kind of bummed out. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4879.219999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, Michael Jordan doesn't like how I'm refing today. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4882.9s)]
*  You could actually see them. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4888.179999999999s)]
*  Like they would just kind of lose it. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4889.46s)]
*  He was the best. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4891.94s)]
*  Kobe had a little of that in the second part of the Kobe too. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4893.0599999999995s)]
*  That was another one who had it. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4895.94s)]
*  Richard Jefferson had that story that he had on the broadcast. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4897.22s)]
*  By the way, shout out to Richard. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4900.02s)]
*  I think he's been really fun on the ESPN call, but he had this story where Kobe was [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4901.54s)]
*  going up and then everybody was complaining and they were like, he was passing. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4908.740000000001s)]
*  He wasn't shooting. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4912.34s)]
*  It should be side out. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4913.14s)]
*  It shouldn't be free throws. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4914.1s)]
*  And Kobe was like, I haven't passed all night. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4915.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4919.860000000001s)]
*  It was like it was over. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4920.5s)]
*  That's it. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4921.9400000000005s)]
*  That's done. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4922.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4923.3s)]
*  He's a good one. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4923.46s)]
*  Second best, third banana. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4925.14s)]
*  That was a good tangent for us. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4926.9s)]
*  Chet Holmgren one. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4928.42s)]
*  Would you have Derek White too? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4929.3s)]
*  Garland, Bain, Reeves. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4930.74s)]
*  Who's your third banana? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4933.7s)]
*  How crazy is this? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4935.86s)]
*  I mean, you want to just, you know what? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4936.74s)]
*  The other part of this is this. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4938.5s)]
*  These are the names that we have when you talk about the, uh, the, the league and the [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4939.86s)]
*  lack of the big three stuff that we were always so used to there for a while. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4945.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4948.98s)]
*  Bridges is in there. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4949.62s)]
*  Draymond, Nas Reid has been playing great. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4950.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4955.22s)]
*  Paul George still in the mix. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4955.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4959.219999999999s)]
*  The league is deep, but I'm just saying like, I think for this to be the group [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4960.339999999999s)]
*  is Mobley. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4964.9s)]
*  So Mobley's two to Mitchell. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4965.62s)]
*  So that means Garland's three. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4967.219999999999s)]
*  Then I think it's Garland's three. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4968.58s)]
*  So Garland number two. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4970.419999999999s)]
*  So you go Holmgren one, Garland two, or Garland one? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4971.62s)]
*  I'd say Garland. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4973.46s)]
*  I'd say Garland ahead of Chet just because he's done it all season long. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4974.66s)]
*  Garland one, Holmgren two, Derek White three. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4978.0199999999995s)]
*  Would you rather have Mikhail Bridges or Derek White? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4982.179999999999s)]
*  I'd rather have Derek White. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4986.5s)]
*  Sugs doesn't count. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4993.219999999999s)]
*  Nope. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4995.0599999999995s)]
*  He's out for the year. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4995.299999999999s)]
*  Bane. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4996.82s)]
*  Grady Dick. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4997.139999999999s)]
*  Reeves is in the mix. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=4998.9s)]
*  Like when you're talking like the four to six range, that's the whole point of this exercise. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5000.179999999999s)]
*  Had him right there too. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5005.139999999999s)]
*  Had him seven. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5006.0199999999995s)]
*  And then Nas, the way Nas is playing was the other one. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5009.86s)]
*  Dude, I don't know. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5012.66s)]
*  I might put Chayden over him now. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5013.299999999999s)]
*  I'm loving what I'm seeing from Chayden lately. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5016.82s)]
*  All NBA watch. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5021.94s)]
*  I think Jokic, Tatum, Janis, SGA, Mitchell at the top is in pen at this point. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5025.0599999999995s)]
*  Second team. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5031.7s)]
*  So there's four guards for second team and third team. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5034.98s)]
*  Edwards, Curry, Brunson, Cade. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5038.099999999999s)]
*  Brunson looks like he's going to be out for at least a couple more weeks. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5039.7s)]
*  He's at 61 games right now. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5042.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5044.02s)]
*  The news today was one to two more weeks to see where we're at. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5044.18s)]
*  So that doesn't seem to be good. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5047.22s)]
*  I think there's a real Curry case if they can move into, if they can become a top four seed. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5048.18s)]
*  I think there's a Curry case. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5055.06s)]
*  I would have had Brunson and Edwards or Brunson and Cade if it was just two cards, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5056.5s)]
*  but I think Curry is now in the mix. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5060.580000000001s)]
*  I don't know how it plays out. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5062.02s)]
*  I'm not willing to commit. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5062.9800000000005s)]
*  And then I think Shangoone with the fact that Houston hasn't gone away. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5065.860000000001s)]
*  If you look at his stats, if you look at the on-off stuff with him, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5069.700000000001s)]
*  if you watch the games and see how important he is in the fourth quarters for them. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5074.02s)]
*  I think there's a Shangoone case now. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5079.620000000001s)]
*  If you want to pick a center for third team, if you want to put [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5081.38s)]
*  Jaren Jackson and town second team together and save a spot for Shangoone, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5084.42s)]
*  I just think he's in the mix now. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5089.780000000001s)]
*  So is Dame the way Dame's playing hard and obviously I think Jaylen Brown, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5091.620000000001s)]
*  just because of the Celtics, Garland. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5096.580000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5100.18s)]
*  Third team is still in progress, I will say. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5101.06s)]
*  Yeah, not that much has changed me from last week to this week, but I mean, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5106.580000000001s)]
*  are you going to end up going Shangoone if Houston's a two seed, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5110.42s)]
*  but it's only separated by like a couple games? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5114.34s)]
*  That's where I think you guys lose your mind on the seeding stuff. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5116.18s)]
*  Because at any point, if you thought Shangoone's one of the 15 best players [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5118.580000000001s)]
*  in the NBA this year, I guess your answer is no, because it's no for me. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5121.860000000001s)]
*  And he's been nice and they're putting together a winning streak and all that kind of stuff. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5125.14s)]
*  He had probably one of the best passes, maybe the single best pass of the season, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5128.74s)]
*  but again, that's not enough to make all NBA. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5131.54s)]
*  But I think sometimes you guys, when you really, really start emphasizing the seeding stuff. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5133.38s)]
*  Are you guysing me? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5135.94s)]
*  Yeah, I am. I'm you guysing you. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5137.3s)]
*  Because I hear it all the time with the SGA Jokic stuff, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5138.66s)]
*  which I would imagine Thunder fans weren't arguing for Harden to win MVP [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5141.3s)]
*  when they were a three seed and OKC was a six seed when Westbrook won it in 17. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5145.86s)]
*  So the Thunder fans that are arguing strictly the standings being the tiebreaker between SGA [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5151.46s)]
*  and Jokic. Like, I don't know, man. I think a lot of times. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5155.62s)]
*  You're going to put Shangoone on an all NBA, even if they're two games ahead of the fifth seed. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5160.74s)]
*  First of all, I don't appreciate being you guys. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5168.42s)]
*  I did. I don't do it to you. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5170.66s)]
*  Second of all, as you know, I'm a traditionalist and I want to center on my third team. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5171.62s)]
*  And there's if Jaren Jackson and Towns make second team, I have a center spot for the third team. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5178.98s)]
*  So at that point, I don't know who the other options are for center. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5185.78s)]
*  I mean, it's Wemby's spot. Wemby went out. It's not my fault. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5189.54s)]
*  It's not you guys. That is. That's not your fault. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5193.3s)]
*  You're right. That part I'll concede. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5195.78s)]
*  The thing for me is I think ultimately, when we finally get to game 82, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5197.7s)]
*  I might have trouble putting Towns second team on NBA with some of the defense stuff I've watched. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5204.18s)]
*  I've been watching it more carefully. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5209.3s)]
*  I might not be able to get there with him as a second team on NBA guy. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5211.78s)]
*  There's some just I mean, Yoko has him to Yoko has a bad defensive possessions, too. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5214.74s)]
*  There's some just godawful Towns defensive possessions. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5219.94s)]
*  So I'm factoring that in as well. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5224.0199999999995s)]
*  He's either second or third team. He's going to make one of my three teams. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5226.58s)]
*  Yeah. But are you going to have Shingoon if you're a traditionalist, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5229.7s)]
*  you can wish Shingoon second team all NBA? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5231.94s)]
*  No, I'm saying moving Towns from. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5234.34s)]
*  I think Jaren Jackson is looking like he's going to be second team. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5236.98s)]
*  He'd be a lot of ways out. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5239.94s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5241.46s)]
*  So the question is whether Towns can sneak in there or not. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5242.34s)]
*  Ideally, Towns goes to third team. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5246.26s)]
*  I might do three guards for second team, too. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5248.18s)]
*  I don't know. We could talk about that. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5250.58s)]
*  Yeah. But the Jaren Jackson part of it, like he's a forward. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5251.62s)]
*  Yeah. But he I mean, you can sneak him as a pseudo center. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5258.34s)]
*  You're a revolutionary. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5264.18s)]
*  He's a pseudo center. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5264.9800000000005s)]
*  Who else do they have at center other than Edie? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5266.9800000000005s)]
*  Jay Huff. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5270.26s)]
*  Brandon Clark. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5271.46s)]
*  He's basically a center. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5272.42s)]
*  He's a he's no less of a center than my BAM out of Iowa's. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5273.86s)]
*  Yeah. But BAM was legitimately stuck playing center the whole time until [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5279.14s)]
*  this where thing came along this year. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5282.9s)]
*  A couple other things I care about before we go. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5288.58s)]
*  And I do want to give you the floor for college hoops so you can give us five minutes to tell us [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5291.3s)]
*  what to look for if you don't really care. The Philly Brooklyn, Toronto comedy of [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5295.38s)]
*  five, six, seven spots in the draft are just all time hilarious. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5301.46s)]
*  Quentin Green, Quentin Grimes goes on a heater. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5306.42s)]
*  I didn't watch one minute of it. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5309.06s)]
*  And Philly beats Dallas. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5311.94s)]
*  And now it's just somebody's going to get fucked and somebody's going to get bounced [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5314.74s)]
*  backwards and wonder why they had the season they had to not even get a top seven pick. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5320.42s)]
*  So Brooklyn is 22 wins. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5325.06s)]
*  Philly is 23. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5326.82s)]
*  Toronto is 24. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5327.78s)]
*  I have no idea why Toronto is trying to compete in these games. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5329.22s)]
*  Philly doesn't want to compete, but one anyway. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5334.58s)]
*  And then Brooklyn's whole season has been designed for them not to be good. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5336.820000000001s)]
*  And they just keep foiling themselves. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5339.860000000001s)]
*  Who who's going to get the five spot out of these teams? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5342.1s)]
*  Priscilla Brooklyn, Philly or Toronto? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5344.66s)]
*  Toronto, I believe maybe they're second again, but the last time I sent it to you [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5347.3s)]
*  because you and I are invested in the under because they're insanely irrational fan base, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5351.9400000000005s)]
*  lost their minds because we all took the under. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5357.54s)]
*  And at one point there, it was a complete lock because I looked at it was like, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5359.54s)]
*  they're going to have to go 500 over their last 20 to go over. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5362.9800000000005s)]
*  And so I mean, at one point, I think they were eight and 31. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5367.54s)]
*  Yeah, you know, there was no point that I go like, hey, this and granted, they've been hurt. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5370.9800000000005s)]
*  But like, even if they were healthy, the problem is they play like, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5374.9800000000005s)]
*  I think when you have these guys, they're on NBA life support. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5379.14s)]
*  They're playing their asses off. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5382.02s)]
*  I watched that Philly game the other night where Rodin had 20 something. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5383.54s)]
*  And you're going to go back through and be like, where the hell did this guy come from or whatever? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5387.14s)]
*  And so it's a JT Thor and game 82, just going nuts. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5391.22s)]
*  I think they have the third best record against the spread in the NBA this year. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5396.74s)]
*  So Toronto's Toronto's been on Phoenix's last. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5400.82s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that's I think Phoenix is 20 games under 500 with the spread this year, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5405.46s)]
*  which is almost impossible. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5409.38s)]
*  Well, Philly Philly's win today really hurt them because being at six, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5411.46s)]
*  all they have to do is get jumped by one team and they lose their pick and just OK, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5416.34s)]
*  see winning the title and then getting the seventh pick in the draft would be nuts. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5421.3s)]
*  Couple other things. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5426.0199999999995s)]
*  We're in a Houston, Memphis, Denver, two, three, four, basically a tie right now. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5426.9s)]
*  By the way, can we, has anyone ever discussed why Dallas took on 30 million [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5431.0599999999995s)]
*  and guaranteed money with Caleb Martin and moved out crimes? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5434.58s)]
*  Well, now I guess it's because they couldn't come up with a contract extension, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5441.54s)]
*  but he was still restricted. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5444.58s)]
*  So you could have just matched it. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5445.62s)]
*  But that one doesn't make a ton of sense. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5447.38s)]
*  At that point. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5450.5s)]
*  Well, Kyrie hadn't gotten hurt yet, right? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5451.7s)]
*  Davis hadn't gotten hurt yet either. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5453.38s)]
*  And they had traded for Christie. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5455.86s)]
*  That trade looks awful now. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5459.94s)]
*  I always like Grimes Houston, Memphis, Denver all together. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5461.14s)]
*  So that's the two, three, four, and then Lakers Golden State, Minnesota, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5464.74s)]
*  all separated by one win basically. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5468.18s)]
*  Or two, I guess the Lakers had the upper hand on that. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5470.9s)]
*  And then in the East, the East is pretty boring. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5475.86s)]
*  It's basically Milwaukee, Indy Detroit, just kind of fighting it out for four, five, six. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5478.9s)]
*  And I'm not sure it really matters. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5483.3s)]
*  I went through and did the last 15, you know, I always like to look at offense and defense [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5485.54s)]
*  and do it every few days. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5489.86s)]
*  And I did it this morning again. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5491.0599999999995s)]
*  And when you go through the offenses and what's happening here in the East, the last month, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5493.86s)]
*  the West has 13 of the top 19 offenses in the NBA in the last month. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5498.34s)]
*  So then you just start going through all these other teams. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5503.7s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, these times are falling apart, except for Toronto, who's just doing it [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5505.62s)]
*  with defense. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5510.42s)]
*  This team's been playing like really good defense and pulling out all these games. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5511.06s)]
*  And would you see the Celtic schedule the last month? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5515.3s)]
*  It's like a cake walk. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5519.3s)]
*  No, I just looked at it to see what good games are left. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5520.58s)]
*  And it's like, it's just a bunch of shit games. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5524.26s)]
*  Even like their West coast, they have one more like road trip. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5526.98s)]
*  And even that one, there's only two tough ones left. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5530.5s)]
*  So, and they know that they're locked in the number two seed. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5533.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's going to be, you know, it's usually be night. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5535.7s)]
*  Get ready to see more Bailey Shireman. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5539.219999999999s)]
*  All those fucking people. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5542.58s)]
*  So just to update everybody. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5543.78s)]
*  So again, Toronto and January 11th, eight and 31. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5546.0199999999995s)]
*  So that means they're 16 and 13 for two months. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5549.62s)]
*  How is that possible? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5553.379999999999s)]
*  With that team, with all of the guys, you know, basically not playing now for a while. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5554.58s)]
*  If I look it up here, post all star break, let me see how many games these dudes have played in. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5559.86s)]
*  Well, RJ. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5564.74s)]
*  Well, I guess they played in more than I thought. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5567.46s)]
*  Hey, can I welcome you to a special part of the show, which is brought to you today by Audi [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5571.78s)]
*  with their all new fully electric Audi Q6 e-tron? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5575.38s)]
*  Yeah, we have the Celtic city documentary that's going on. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5578.66s)]
*  The Celtic city documentary that's going on HBO and a max and it runs on Monday's nine o'clock. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5582.0199999999995s)]
*  And we did a episode two is about bill Russell. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5586.74s)]
*  Did you ever do the exercise? [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5590.9s)]
*  I know it's hard to cross eras, but did you ever do the exercise of. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5592.419999999999s)]
*  If you put Russell now, I don't think he can be the same height and weight. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5598.099999999999s)]
*  I think you almost have to make him 2025 Russell. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5602.259999999999s)]
*  So maybe make them like six 11, but that skill set that he had, what that, what would that look [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5605.299999999999s)]
*  like now? Because I actually think he there's a thought that it'd be like, I'd be being out of [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5610.82s)]
*  bio. And it's, um, I think you have to add the better shoes, the better conditioning, all the [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5614.9s)]
*  diets, all the advantages they have now. I actually think he would be as impactful as he was 60 years [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5620.34s)]
*  ago is my hot take. But what do you think? Cause there's more athletes now. The game's different. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5627.38s)]
*  You need shooting. Obviously he wouldn't be able to space the floor. There would be some stuff that [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5633.299999999999s)]
*  would be a little weird, but how do you see like when you, when you try to translate the guys from [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5637.78s)]
*  the sixties to now, is it just impossible or are there things you think you could take? [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5643.7s)]
*  It always felt incredibly disrespectful to just go, okay, well he's six, eight and two 25. And, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5650.099999999999s)]
*  you know, he'd be a role guy and it's bill Russell. So I never wanted to do that. Um, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5656.099999999999s)]
*  maybe if I were really young, I'd be that way, but then every single person would tell you that saw [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5661.139999999999s)]
*  him play. Like he would, he would figure it out. It's like, what would he grow? You know? So like, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5665.54s)]
*  what are we talking about here? It's almost like Michael Kidd Gilchrist size. He was six, nine and [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5671.14s)]
*  five eights. So that's basically Tatum site. I think tech, cause I think Tatum's legitimately six, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5677.22s)]
*  nine. Yeah. Gilchrist is shorter than that. So, uh, I shouldn't say that, but, um, you know, look, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5684.42s)]
*  I got to interview him once. It was probably one of the biggest thrills of my career and everybody [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5691.86s)]
*  asked him the same thing. And he's just like, I was going to run these guys. So is it, is it a [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5696.099999999999s)]
*  Mowgli without the three in the corner a couple of times a game? Is it Mowgli like Mowgli 2.0, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5699.54s)]
*  a crazy, crazy version of him where he's just all over the place, like having the greatest game of [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5708.0199999999995s)]
*  his life. But that's just him like game. I, the part that would be interesting to me is just how [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5712.58s)]
*  everything, cause I read up on him. Um, after we had episode two, I just went on a Russell deep [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5717.38s)]
*  dive bench and it's the competitiveness thing that is just the over and over thing. Right. He was [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5723.3s)]
*  just like psychotically competitive, which is what Jordan had too. So I think it'd be interesting to [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5728.18s)]
*  take that and just put that into the current basketball season and league pass and like even [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5733.14s)]
*  put him in an all star game and all these different, um, you know, things that we are always mad that [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5738.34s)]
*  the guys aren't trying harder, why are they going through the motions? And he just couldn't really [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5743.94s)]
*  do that until the tail end of his career and started running out of gas. So what was it? He's, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5747.86s)]
*  he's seven and O in game sevens. I mean, some of the, I had some of the stats I had for you. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5753.62s)]
*  Right. And then I think there's some other ridiculous one where, no, he's 16 and two [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5762.179999999999s)]
*  in elimination games. Okay. He was 10 and O in game sevens against will he was 84 and 58. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5768.1s)]
*  Though the interesting thing is like there's, and I wrote a thing in my book about it, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5777.14s)]
*  like just the miss that come out of the Russell will thing. And one of the misses I go, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5781.14s)]
*  waltz numbers were so much better than Russell's. And then you go to the playoffs. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5785.54s)]
*  They average the same amount of rebounds. Will had 24.5 rebounds in 160 games. Russell had 24.9. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5790.5s)]
*  So we had more rebounds. Russell had 4.7 assists. Wilt had 4.2. And then wilt scored 22.5 points. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5797.7s)]
*  And Russell had 16.2. So in the playoffs, which is that's 160 games, not a small sample size, [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5807.54s)]
*  you got six more points a game from wilt and Russell was better. Everything else. But Russell [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5815.139999999999s)]
*  was also like the greatest teammate of all time and the best defensive player of all time. I [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5819.7s)]
*  don't know what we're arguing. And then the other thing was the supporting cast, which [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5824.5s)]
*  I debunked pretty quickly. Like, yeah, Russell first five years of waltz career, Russell had [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5829.54s)]
*  better teammates than the next, the rest of waltz career. He always had the best teammates, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5834.02s)]
*  you know, so that you can't say that one either. Yeah. He's, he's weirdly become underrated [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5839.14s)]
*  partially because there's no stats that capture some of the stuff he did. Like we didn't keep [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5845.86s)]
*  track of blocks until 1973. So he was just like, yeah, Russell had a lot of blocks that game. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5850.26s)]
*  And that's how we talked about him in like game seven of a conference finals, whereas like [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5855.14s)]
*  kept track of points and rebounds. So, um, yeah, I think he's underrated. He's fallen out of the go [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5859.14s)]
*  conversation, even though he won the most, everyone in his era has talked about how incredible he was [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5865.780000000001s)]
*  and there was no greater winner, all that stuff. So obviously there's some hybrid, but he's, he's [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5870.820000000001s)]
*  to me, he's still in the top four all time. Yeah. The year they got them, um, 66, 67 season [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5875.86s)]
*  for loaded sixers. Yeah. Yeah. They, they had 68 wins. So I remember growing up and again, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5885.38s)]
*  it was all just kind of legend, right? Before you had access, maybe somebody would buy you a book [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5891.299999999999s)]
*  and you go back and read some of this stuff, but it was always a will didn't have, didn't have the [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5895.86s)]
*  same guys and have the same guys. And then you're like, well, they won 68 games one year, and then [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5900.98s)]
*  they won 62 the next year when everybody thought Boston was done. And then Boston beats them in the [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5905.3s)]
*  playoffs again. So I don't never know what to do with will cause all the numbers look, make belief, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5910.1s)]
*  but it would feel incredibly dismissive to look at Russell size and go, he would just be this [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5915.9400000000005s)]
*  rotational guy that would match up in a, he'd be your small ball five center. You know, it just, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5923.78s)]
*  it seems wrong. And maybe there's just no point in even doing that. Cause it's, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5932.58s)]
*  that's probably the answer. It would be, it would basically be what Jonathan Isaac was doing last [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5937.7s)]
*  year in the magic and those 20 minutes stretches multiplied by five, but he would have been doing [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5941.7s)]
*  it for eight straight months every year. Wow. We were like, Holy shit, Russell had 17 blocks. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5945.86s)]
*  I think what I liked the most is the last title that they got against the Lakers. Yeah. Like that [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5952.099999999999s)]
*  one where people think it's kind of over. And I also loved in the doc where it was just very [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5957.7s)]
*  classic. And this is another example of things never change is that post red stepping down, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5964.179999999999s)]
*  they make Bill Russell player coach. And so if you do something different and it doesn't work, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5969.46s)]
*  it's way worse than just doing it the same and not having it work. So then it's a Russell thing. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5975.46s)]
*  And then it totally works out. And then as Russell wins a title, there's a press conference two days [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5980.82s)]
*  after and someone asks red like, Hey, what did you actually think about the coaching? And the tone [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5986.98s)]
*  of it is they won and bread just like sitting there. And I think the access, you know, all the [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5991.379999999999s)]
*  different historical stuff that you guys have put into this. And I know there's so many people [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=5997.299999999999s)]
*  involved in this project, but of all of the projects, I think it's just good to remind people [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6000.98s)]
*  of what that run was. And for it to be partnered, you know, with your platform and with HBO, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6007.459999999999s)]
*  people are going to think I'm kissing your ass here, but I just think it's the truth. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6013.459999999999s)]
*  The same way the last dance, it was just nice little reminders. And when we didn't have games [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6016.5s)]
*  during COVID and we were watching those bulls series and you and I were going through them, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6020.26s)]
*  like I'm really glad that I did it because it helped me have like a completely different [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6025.14s)]
*  level of appreciation. And it was the first time I was watching the bulls as somebody that just [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6029.54s)]
*  talks about basketball, not just a guy in college. It was pissed that Jordan was winning all the time. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6033.06s)]
*  Like I didn't really appreciate Jordan enough because I certainly wasn't a bulls fan. And, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6036.82s)]
*  you know, again, I wanted Barkley to beat him so bad in 93. So to watch this, and I've seen a lot [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6040.9s)]
*  of the stuff, but to see it and then the added depth and how long this is going to go on, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6046.26s)]
*  I do think that if you think of the worthy things of the 20th century that are worth [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6053.06s)]
*  reminding people of, 11 titles in 13 fucking years is a pretty good start. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6058.9800000000005s)]
*  RG Yeah. I mean, that's certainly how we felt working on it. Because I just think people [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6064.02s)]
*  forget and it's like, ah, there's only eight teams back then. I remember during the last dance, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6069.38s)]
*  you and I were doing those pods and we were so stunned how little everybody knew about [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6077.22s)]
*  the Jordan bulls. It was one of the first times I really felt old. Remember there was that Rodman [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6082.9800000000005s)]
*  episode and everybody was like, Rodman, what was up with that guy? And we were like, what? [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6088.1s)]
*  He's just assuming everybody knew Rodman was this crazy up and down roller coaster ride that they [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6093.22s)]
*  were able to just kind of corral in time for these three straight post seasons. And basically people [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6098.18s)]
*  like my son just had no idea, which of course they wouldn't, but you just kind of forget because [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6103.94s)]
*  we know all the beats. So that was one of the things we were trying to do with the Celtic [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6108.66s)]
*  series. Anyway, it's a lot of meat there. RG What is it like for you personally to be able to [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6112.0199999999995s)]
*  produce something like this? That's basically your favorite thing in your life. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6118.0199999999995s)]
*  RG For me, I didn't want to fuck it up. I mean, we had so many good people behind it, but I felt [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6123.46s)]
*  I would have been so mad if somebody else did it and didn't get stuff right. So for me, it's like, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6130.1s)]
*  just let's not fuck this up. We got one chance. Let's try to make the best version of this. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6135.22s)]
*  Last Dance, I think, did a great job of here's this piece of... [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6144.26s)]
*  RG Unless you were his teammate, right? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6149.06s)]
*  RG Well, that's true. But I mean, the stuff that people got mad about was pretty honest. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6150.42s)]
*  And that was all that stuff that was in the books too. It was just a lot of people to know about it. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6157.62s)]
*  And Isaiah was mad about how he was portrayed in it, which I get, I understand. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6163.14s)]
*  RG What did you think was going to happen? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6170.0199999999995s)]
*  RG Yeah, that was Isaiah's reputation. That's why he got left off the dream team. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6170.98s)]
*  He was a pretty polarizing guy when he played. So I think when you're doing these things, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6176.0199999999995s)]
*  you have a responsibility to tell the history, be as fair as possible, weigh the agendas of [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6180.58s)]
*  the different people who are doing interviews for it. Because as the years pass, it becomes super [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6186.66s)]
*  easy to tweak stuff however way you want to make yourself look better. And these are documents. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6191.54s)]
*  If you're doing them correctly, they're documents. RG I loved Cousy admitting he'd never sniffed or [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6197.46s)]
*  snorted or shot up. He's like, Bob Cousy sitting there, North of 90 going, I never considered [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6202.18s)]
*  myself hot. They show some campaign of him and Frank Gifford. Right. Where they were like, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6210.0199999999995s)]
*  some guy, Frank Gifford. Yeah, Gifford, a looker. And then he's like, I did drink beers. We did [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6216.42s)]
*  drink a lot of beers because in season, you didn't want to be drinking the hard stuff and have [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6223.620000000001s)]
*  somebody go, why are you drinking that? You're an athlete. He's like, but I never sniffed and I never [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6229.38s)]
*  injected or I never shot. And it was just the thing. It's always like the couple of chances I [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6233.540000000001s)]
*  ever had any access to stuff when I was still living in Boston. There's just like, it's not even [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6238.900000000001s)]
*  my generation. I don't even know if it's your generation. I think it's our father's generation [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6244.58s)]
*  of like the reverence and the holy fuck. And, you know, it meant a lot to me. And I certainly [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6248.58s)]
*  appreciate it more now having the Celtics Comcast station just invite me to be a part of that studio [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6254.34s)]
*  stuff. And I remember how much it meant to my father when he's like, you're sitting on a desk [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6261.22s)]
*  with Tommy Hineson. Like you're sitting next to Tommy Hineson kind of arguing about what just [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6266.1s)]
*  happened in a playoff game. And I'm kind of like, you know, Tommy was a little tough to me at first [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6272.5s)]
*  because he was like, who's this guy? And then he was a big teddy bear and we were great. And he was [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6278.42s)]
*  so awesome to me. And, you know, maybe this doesn't resonate with anyone outside of the New England [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6282.82s)]
*  area or whatever, but like these dudes were gods to our fathers and, um, at least the accomplishment, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6288.1s)]
*  you know, it matches it. Like how else would you have ever thought? Like think about these guys as [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6296.02s)]
*  you have so many of the people in the doc going, you just went into every summer, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6300.74s)]
*  assuming the Celtics are going to win the world championship. It was expected. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6304.58s)]
*  I remember it came out that, or maybe I'd mentioned that I was writing my basketball book in the late [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6310.5s)]
*  2000s. I think I probably told you this story, but I'll say it again. Um, and I went to a Celtic game [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6315.54s)]
*  during the KG season and some guy came up to me, he was an older guy. It was like my dad's age. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6321.86s)]
*  And he was like, Hey, it was like at halftime games. Like, Hey, you're writing that basketball [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6327.54s)]
*  book. I saw, I saw you writing a basketball book. I'm like, yeah. And he's like, you better get [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6332.0199999999995s)]
*  Russell right. Russell was the best. You don't understand. Russell was the best. I was going to [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6337.46s)]
*  those games. Russell was the best. Just make sure your book covers that. He walked away. I was like, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6344.42s)]
*  all right, like little stuff like that matters. Like this guy was like, just went out of his way [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6349.78s)]
*  to tell me that for 12 seconds. When got a beer. I mean, honestly, it sounds like my dad might've [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6354.58s)]
*  grabbed it. Cause that's, and look, my father played and you know, he was, he was a big guy [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6359.62s)]
*  and he used to, for these high school all-star teams he was on, they used to have those barn [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6366.02s)]
*  storming things for the athletes in the off season. So Will actually told my father, he was like, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6371.3s)]
*  Hey, cause he was, my father was always the tallest. And he was like, Hey, do you, uh, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6377.06s)]
*  how many points you score? You know, he'd be like, I had 16 or whatever. He's like, he goes, [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6381.78s)]
*  when the guards, when the guards go down to court, do you run after him? And he was like, well, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6386.099999999999s)]
*  you know, he's like, never stop running. He goes, it's extra eight points a night. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6391.62s)]
*  He goes, wow. He's like the guards, they always miss the layups. He's like, so when a guy gets [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6398.0199999999995s)]
*  out on the fast break, but it's one-on-one or it's two-on-two, you always run. He goes, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6402.5s)]
*  extra points. Like, and Will wasn't even thinking of like, it's winning. It was, it's extra points. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6407.38s)]
*  I don't know if it's a thing where, you know, our influences are so Celtics heavy based on [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6415.38s)]
*  what our families grew up rooting for, but the Will Russell thing to them is like embarrassing. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6421.46s)]
*  And yet you pull a basketball reference and it would seem embarrassing to think that Russell [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6427.9400000000005s)]
*  was better than Will. So, you know, I can only defer to kind of like, and look, I'm not even [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6431.78s)]
*  going to say I can defer to it. I can read everything. Montville's most recent book that [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6437.38s)]
*  really got into that finals and the part where the comeback happens with a Will. Like there's just a [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6441.0599999999995s)]
*  generation of people that would look at Will as this guy that you actually wouldn't trust despite [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6444.98s)]
*  the resume. And it's just hard when you're not living it every day to day and you're only going [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6452.5s)]
*  by other accounts. The crazy thing with Will was how many people, players and coaches, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6456.5s)]
*  who either played with them or against them or coached with them or against them, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6461.62s)]
*  just murdered him. And I don't know whether that was the era or if he was that frustrating, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6465.54s)]
*  but people just had no problems talking about how he didn't want the ball in the clutch. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6472.98s)]
*  It was a pain in the ass. I mean, he did get traded twice during the prime of his career, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6477.46s)]
*  which is usually a red flag. Anyway, Celtic City, third episode, the all new fully electric Audi Q6 [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6481.0599999999995s)]
*  e-tron, a huge leap forward featuring effortless power, serious acceleration, the most advanced [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6488.5s)]
*  tech of any Audi ever, experienced technology that puts you center stage with a panoramic digital [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6492.82s)]
*  stage plus an optional screen for front seat passengers. Perfect for watching the latest [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6497.46s)]
*  sports documentary. The Q6 e-tron, not just the new EV, it's a new way to experience driving. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6502.66s)]
*  Learn more at AudiUSA.com. Always pay careful attention to the road. Do not drive while [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6507.3s)]
*  distracted. Speaking of books, John Feinstein passed away and he wrote one of the great sports [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6512.1s)]
*  books of all time, Season on the Brink, which I think breaks the game as the best sports book [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6518.660000000001s)]
*  ever. I'll fight that one probably to the death because I don't think anyone's going to top it. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6524.18s)]
*  Then there's four or five, six books after that that have to be mentioned. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6529.14s)]
*  And Season on the Brink would be one of the first ones for me. I remember reading it on an airplane [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6533.700000000001s)]
*  and the airplane could have crashed and I would have been like, hold on, hold on, I'm on page 68. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6538.9s)]
*  I just, I don't think you can overstate how little information we had in the 80s. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6544.66s)]
*  And to have some reporter just go behind the scenes with Bobby Knight, it was this mythical [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6551.7s)]
*  figure and just capture everything, how insane the guy was, how he dealt with the players and [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6556.339999999999s)]
*  the story of that season. It was such a memorable experience. I probably read that book five, six [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6562.58s)]
*  times over the course of my life. So after you read a book like that, the rest is gravy, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6571.3s)]
*  legacy-wise, and during a week like this. He wrote a bunch of books, but that book was an all-timer. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6577.62s)]
*  I feel like it changed the way people approach sports books after that. And it's a hall of [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6583.38s)]
*  fame for me, Rosilla. Yeah. I love the dynamic of that book because you have Bobby Knight, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6590.5s)]
*  who thinks like fine scenes in on it with him. Right? He's like, yeah, this guy's just like, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6599.7s)]
*  a big fan. But he's young and he's ready to kind of make a name for himself. And then Bobby Knight [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6607.86s)]
*  looks at it as a complete betrayal, but it was like, well, however that was accepted or what the [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6616.02s)]
*  understanding was, it was two personalities where it actually made sense that after that book came [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6623.860000000001s)]
*  out, everybody was pissed, but it put John on the map. And I definitely enjoyed, he had a, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6631.14s)]
*  I'm trying to remember, I think the open inside the ropes at Bethpage Black on the 02 US Open. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6638.58s)]
*  I loved that one. The punch is awesome. Good walk spoiled was a good one. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6647.54s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I kind of kept going back to him. He was one of those guys that just [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6653.14s)]
*  was benefited the doubt for a really long time because of a season on the brink. And [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6658.26s)]
*  it's, it predates Friday Night Lights. Right? So it, yes. It was one of those things where you [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6664.18s)]
*  couldn't believe like you were getting this kind of information because we just never got any of [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6670.34s)]
*  it. We never got any of that kind of stuff. And Knight was really the number one guy as far as [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6674.34s)]
*  if you could ever spend a season with the coach and getting to know him, he'd be the first choice. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6681.22s)]
*  And I think because John was so much younger, I believe is the way the story goes that the night [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6685.62s)]
*  just was like, oh, whatever. Yeah. Like he can hang around cause he's not established. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6689.22s)]
*  Sports books were in a weird spot because they used to be like those autobiographies that were [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6693.860000000001s)]
*  written by the player, but they obviously weren't written by them. And when they made a splash, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6698.900000000001s)]
*  it was usually like when Sparkle Isle did the Bronx Zoo and was shitting on Reggie Jackson in it. And [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6702.58s)]
*  they excerpted it in sport magazine. It was like, Oh my God, he said that about Reggie. And you know, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6708.26s)]
*  that's kind of where we were. There was some good biography or autobiographies like Kareem. Kareem [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6714.9800000000005s)]
*  had a decent one. Wilt had a really good one. Bill Russell had two good ones, but for the most [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6720.9s)]
*  part, there wasn't books like this. Halberstam breaks to the game when he spent like a year [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6725.78s)]
*  just immersed in the NBA. It didn't hit like this season on the brink did because of the night stuff. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6730.98s)]
*  Cause Knight got mad was the difference. The way Knight reacted to the book became part of the story. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6738.099999999999s)]
*  And Knight was, I don't know, the first in the seventies, eighties, nineties, one of the three [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6743.860000000001s)]
*  or four biggest coaches period. I don't even know how to describe them now. We don't have coaches [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6750.820000000001s)]
*  like that anymore. Like you told you talked about Dan Hurley before. Knight was like a hundred times [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6755.38s)]
*  bigger than Dan Hurley. Totally. I mean, you know, Bobby Knight was, was this guy that again, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6759.7s)]
*  at the beginning of the generational stuff that we were talking about with the Celtics is like [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6766.42s)]
*  everybody's dad would have wanted their son to play for Bobby Knight, which probably surprises [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6769.46s)]
*  a lot of the younger people who are listening right now. Yeah. Like Bobby Knight's where you [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6773.86s)]
*  would want your son to go play because he would turn you into a man. And I would argue the more [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6777.7s)]
*  it continued like Knight was, he was a great coach, but he was also a fucking bully and I hate bullies [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6784.42s)]
*  and it started across the line there. But you know, it's, it's just absurd to think of like how he, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6790.9800000000005s)]
*  how he, it was just so strained that Indiana was basically trying to figure out any way [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6796.900000000001s)]
*  that they could, they could move on from the guy. But it's pretty clear, even though John was with [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6803.46s)]
*  the Washington Post, I think the story goes, I'm looking it up as we're kind of on the fly [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6808.1s)]
*  because the book came out in 86, right? So, and I remember my father never being able to put it down [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6812.5s)]
*  and, uh, I think Feinstein was doing like a story on him and it was the week that he threw the chair. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6818.34s)]
*  And Feinstein didn't kill him. So it makes me think that maybe Knight was like, oh, I'll give [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6828.099999999999s)]
*  this guy access and he's like an ally. And John was hoping to become like an author and get bigger [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6832.82s)]
*  book deals and everything. And, uh, I think knowing John, not that I had a lot to deal with him [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6838.42s)]
*  because there wasn't, I don't know how much you dealt with him with your overlap at ESPN, [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6844.02s)]
*  because it wasn't like he was coming up to Bristol doing a ton of stuff. He would come on to promote [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6847.46s)]
*  a book. I helped him promote a book with Red, actually the Red Arbac book that he did, which [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6850.660000000001s)]
*  was the worst time promotion of any book ever because Red came up to the Kowloon and Saugus [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6856.26s)]
*  and John. The Kowloon? Yeah. But it was the day after the Red Sox that won the world series in [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6860.820000000001s)]
*  2004. So we had planned this all out. Actually Eddie Anelman planned it out and then he went to [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6865.860000000001s)]
*  Hawaii. So then Eddie wasn't on the air at the local station when the Red Sox broke the curse [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6872.02s)]
*  of eight decades. And then they were like, Hey, we got to put you guys on. And we were like, okay, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6876.740000000001s)]
*  no problem. They're like, if it's a sweep, it's going to be the day after. And then people were [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6882.18s)]
*  calling in going like, are you guys the dumbest radio station? And it was like, we, yes. The [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6886.02s)]
*  answer is yes. But it sucked because Red's there in person and you know, it's Red. I mean, are you [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6892.26s)]
*  kidding me? Like two years before he died. Right. And so John is really thankful at the time [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6897.38s)]
*  because we're promoting the book and the book was fun. It was, you know, it was a little different. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6902.26s)]
*  It was kind of like this lunch thing that he would tell these different stories, but whatever. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6905.06s)]
*  Yeah. That book, that Red book was written, I think three different times by three different [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6909.14s)]
*  authors. It was like stories about Red. I read all of them. I enjoyed them. That book came out in 86. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6912.9800000000005s)]
*  Another really interesting thing happened with it. Then they had the Steve Alford, Keith Smartyear [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6919.06s)]
*  after the book. And I didn't have like a favorite college basketball team after the BC gambling [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6924.34s)]
*  scandal. I was kind of a free agent and that book made me like the Indiana. Just kind of like, oh, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6929.62s)]
*  I know those guys. And when that run happened and then they beat DC and Syracuse, you know, and [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6936.66s)]
*  one of the worst no time outs of all time. Another one that's forgotten. Go watch that [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6944.42s)]
*  game on YouTube. Young people listening to this, uh, key smart hits a shot with like three seconds [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6949.62s)]
*  left and Syracuse just completely botches. I don't know what they're trying to do. Anyway, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6955.14s)]
*  um, it was so interesting watching that run with the background of this book and how vivid it was [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6961.0599999999995s)]
*  and all the characters and offered and everybody else. Um, it's a really great one. It's worth, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6966.74s)]
*  it's worth three. It's not that long. I think it's totally worth rereading. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6971.78s)]
*  And, uh, and I'm going to read it at some point over the next six weeks, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6976.5s)]
*  cause I just, everybody talking about it got me fired up. And we talked about what Russell [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6979.7s)]
*  would be like now. Can you imagine taking 1986 Bobby Knight and just dropping him into college [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6984.9s)]
*  sports in 2025 in the NIL era and social media and people getting triggered? I think he would [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6990.26s)]
*  get fired within five minutes. Um, it's like Bobby has been hired. Oh, Bobby Knight has now been [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=6997.14s)]
*  fired. I wouldn't say he was the easiest ESPN employee they've ever had either. No, I don't [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7006.1s)]
*  think it was, but you know, there was sort of some grandfather status there. Uh, and, and they kept [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7011.46s)]
*  putting them on TV and look, I mean, you know, Bobby was, he was like the best for his era, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7018.34s)]
*  but you're right. Like it was, he couldn't fathom seeing the sport evolve the way that it would, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7025.3s)]
*  you know? And I think there's, there's something to be said of being like, Hey, when, when [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7032.820000000001s)]
*  everything's even, I'm going to be better than anybody else. I'm going up against as a coach. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7037.06s)]
*  And for a really long time, um, you could definitely make that claim with Knight. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7040.9800000000005s)]
*  There, he's a good character and breaks of the game too. There's some good Bobby Knight stuff [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7046.58s)]
*  in there. Uh, before we go, give us three minutes. What, what do we need to know about March Madness? [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7050.74s)]
*  Uh, the Johnny's baby we're back. Um, it's pretty funny. I was thinking about St. John's, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7056.1s)]
*  the group of big St. John's fan as a lot of people know. Um, so two seed going up against [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7064.02s)]
*  your big guy. I remember. Yeah, that's, that's the bigger reason. Um, the last time I cared this much, [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7069.46s)]
*  they were the two seed against Gonzaga and they lost in the second round. I think it was [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7078.1s)]
*  San Tangello went crazy. And at the time I was not in the business. I was just a 24 year old kid, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7084.82s)]
*  super fired up, you know, just so I was, I cared about this more than I care about the NBA. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7093.299999999999s)]
*  And my buddy and his girlfriend and my girlfriend were like the Gatsby's and they were like, Hey, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7098.66s)]
*  we're going to come over and watch the game. And I was like, this is a terrible idea. And I had [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7106.259999999999s)]
*  like a studio and I, you know, you know, when you're, you move into a studio apartment with no [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7112.42s)]
*  actual bedroom and the mattress is still there and you're like, when that's kind of the place [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7117.78s)]
*  I was at in my life. And so my buddy kind of knew, and then his girlfriend was foreign. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7122.34s)]
*  And I think the reason I said yes is because the girl I was dating was a teacher. So it would have [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7129.9400000000005s)]
*  made sense that next game would have been like maybe the Saturday or whatever. Um, so I was like, [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7134.1s)]
*  okay, I guess like I have to do this because you can't see each other during the week all that [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7140.0199999999995s)]
*  much, which I actually, you know, it was great for me. So I was so fucking mad about that game [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7143.0599999999995s)]
*  because I love that team so much in 99, the run that they made the, the regional final against [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7150.58s)]
*  Ohio state, which by the way, I watched that in Jamaica and I was at a table. I told everybody [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7156.419999999999s)]
*  just to leave me alone for a little bit. And then a busload of Ohio state fans showed up to the grill [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7162.58s)]
*  and cheering on Ohio state as St. John's lost the regional final. So I had a terrible time that time. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7167.62s)]
*  So then I was like, I was going to watch it alone. Anyway, Gonzaga beats him St. John's loses. And I [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7171.54s)]
*  was so mad, Bill, I was so mad. I left my own apartment and had to walk down the street. I had [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7176.179999999999s)]
*  to go for a walk down church street by myself. And then the German girl was like, I think in her accent [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7182.82s)]
*  was like, I think you take sports too seriously. And I was like, yeah, but now is not the time. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7187.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I'm surprised that's all he said. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7192.82s)]
*  Well, my buddy thought I was kind of being a loser, but he understood. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7199.62s)]
*  You should have come back with something from like some sort of German history thing just to [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7203.86s)]
*  fuck with her. Yeah, right. Just like you guys decided to defend a peninsula in the ocean. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7208.179999999999s)]
*  Dumbasses. I remember my friend Ben, who I could talk about this story now because he's not with [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7215.38s)]
*  the person anymore, but the Patriots game when they lost to the Ravens in the playoffs and like [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7221.94s)]
*  2011 ranch when Ray Rice just first play. Yeah. No, it might've been the Jets game. What was the [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7226.82s)]
*  one where Ridley got knocked out? It was the Jets. The rematch after they killed them. Yeah. It's the [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7233.54s)]
*  Jets game. He came over halftime with his girlfriend. I don't even think he'd been dating that long, [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7239.86s)]
*  but I was like, you should come over and watch the game with me and my dad. And it was like [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7245.54s)]
*  Pats fans. And then he showed up with the girlfriend. The moment I saw her, I knew the [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7249.46s)]
*  Pats were going to lose. I was just like, the vibe's off in the room. I feel like we're controlling [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7252.5s)]
*  this. But the Jets just went on a run right after they showed up. So I make fun of them about it [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7256.42s)]
*  now, but I thought it was a bad sign. Yeah. It wasn't in no form at like 24 years old. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7261.94s)]
*  It's not rational in any way. Right. There's no way that I'd be like, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7268.1s)]
*  one, my apartment was disgusting. Yeah. But again, we're all young, right? So we're young [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7272.1s)]
*  enough to think it would still be normal. And meanwhile, his girlfriend, my girlfriend knew, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7276.82s)]
*  but she didn't really love that version of me. But again, she was actually a sweetheart and she [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7282.5s)]
*  gave me a lot of rope. And looking back, it was like, man, I was such a dick. But his girlfriend [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7288.0199999999995s)]
*  was annoying the shit out of me because she would be like, do you have any more Chardonnay? [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7295.7s)]
*  You're just trying to focus on the game. You're not there to be a host. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7301.78s)]
*  Is this guy going to miss a three? Yeah. Right. And there's like one couch. There's not a lot [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7303.62s)]
*  of room. Again, it's a studio. So I don't even know if it was 200 square feet. And I'm sitting [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7309.0599999999995s)]
*  there and I cared about the outcome of that game probably as much as like maybe the Suns, Bulls, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7312.66s)]
*  and 93. Some of those A's series with the Sox, you kind of knew they weren't going to get it done. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7318.74s)]
*  So it wasn't like this massive let down. The Dave Stewart era? [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7326.18s)]
*  Dave Stewart. Yeah. But maybe the comeback against the Angels in 86. I'm just trying to think of [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7328.74s)]
*  the outcomes of games that I cared about that much because it was like the very end of my run of not [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7335.3s)]
*  being in the business and being desensitized to it a little bit. But it was the worst possible setup. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7339.7s)]
*  And then I was convinced the only reason why St. John's was losing is because I allowed this to [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7345.38s)]
*  happen. So that's on me, really. So now the Johnnys are back. Nephew Kyle is all into it. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7349.38s)]
*  I don't think you guys are going to be closer than right now. Can I say one St. Johnnys thing? [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7357.94s)]
*  Because I've been, and we've probably even talked about this, I've never understood why [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7363.3s)]
*  NBA teams don't add presses if they have depth. I feel like on the side of OKC was just like, [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7368.18s)]
*  hey, with our seven through 12 guys, let's just have a press that we can do for three minutes. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7375.3s)]
*  And the team will never know when it's coming. It would be one of the great weapons we could [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7379.7s)]
*  have in basketball, especially against certain teams that don't necessarily have a- [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7383.38s)]
*  Did Patino try that though? [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7386.74s)]
*  Patino tried it as like an actual regular season. We're going to do this for long stretches. I'm [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7388.42s)]
*  just saying a little three minute thing like, oh, that Austin Reeves is going to be the point guard [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7393.3s)]
*  right now. Let's press this guy for three minutes with the press that we've been working on. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7398.74s)]
*  I just think there's something there that would work if you had the athletes. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7402.74s)]
*  But I like that when they do it in college because it just seems so terrifying. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7406.34s)]
*  Everybody loves Florida. They're on it now. That Clayton Jr. kid, the kid that was at Iona, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7411.22s)]
*  that apparently Patino was trying to get to go to St. John's, he was damn near perfect in the [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7418.34s)]
*  Alabama win. He was really good again today. He's a real point guard. I don't even know if he's on [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7424.740000000001s)]
*  the draft list or whatever. And then they've got two huge guys that they can go to. They can play [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7430.34s)]
*  defense. They can throw a lot of size at you. And they kind of ran away from Tennessee. Tennessee [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7434.58s)]
*  had a lot of foul trouble today. Look, I think St. John's has seven to eight guys where you all [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7439.94s)]
*  feel like they bring something to the table to knock on them is they're not going to be able [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7449.0599999999995s)]
*  to shoot it enough to win six games. 29 to one on Fandl. Florida's plus 390. No, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7451.86s)]
*  they're second. Duke's the favorite plus three to me. Duke's the favorite because apparently [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7459.46s)]
*  Flag is coming back. Yeah. Yeah. I don't really look, I started watching the last, [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7463.22s)]
*  I've been watching St. John's now pretty regularly, but I watched all the conference [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7470.02s)]
*  tournament stuff, but I could barely get through that. I don't even try. I don't even try to fake [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7474.900000000001s)]
*  it during the championship weekend anymore. I'm just like, oh, I'll jump in. Then the tournament [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7479.06s)]
*  starts. I've lost. That's another thing I've just given up as I've gotten older because I'd [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7484.58s)]
*  chosen to watch OKC in Detroit for some reason. Game 68. OKC's already locked up a one seed. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7488.98s)]
*  For some reason, I'm picking that over like a college hoops game. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7497.86s)]
*  Yeah. I don't really have anything. Anybody that's been watching all season long, I'm not [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7502.179999999999s)]
*  going to offer them anything, but I did enjoy watching this week. I enjoyed watching Florida. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7506.259999999999s)]
*  You ran on Flag though. What's that? You ran on Flag. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7510.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. No, it just sucks you got hurt, but watching, I think it was the last regular season [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7513.78s)]
*  North Carolina game. I watched the BC game where it looked like everybody on BC wanted to punch [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7518.9s)]
*  him in the face, which was a good sign because Flag responded well to it. Yeah, but it's not like [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7522.179999999999s)]
*  I'm not your guy to ask anything of. I know what the Johnnys look like. It's about it. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7528.42s)]
*  Rossello, you're doing two pods this week. We'll be back on this pod next week. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7533.219999999999s)]
*  We were going to do a gimmick for today, but then we farted around with all this other stuff, [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7540.099999999999s)]
*  which is my fault. We'll do the gimmick next week that I was really excited about, [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7544.5s)]
*  but I thought would have been really good. Somehow we still killed two hours without doing [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7548.1s)]
*  the giant gimmick that I thought we were going to do. We'll pack that next week. Then thanks to [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7552.42s)]
*  Gahau and Kyle and Cerruti as well for producing new rewatchables coming Monday night. We did [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7558.660000000001s)]
*  Days of Thunder, Rossello. Cruz, Kidman? Oh, no kidding. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7565.14s)]
*  Maybe, sort of, yes. Oh no, no. I mean, who wasn't in on that? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7570.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, good. How could you even call yourself an American back then and not be excited about it? [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7575.46s)]
*  It's really good. We're a little critical of Cruz. Not going to say he's on autopilot in it, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7578.58s)]
*  but he's done better. It's still great. I mean, he still puts up 25, seven, and eight, but [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7585.3s)]
*  you know, it's not like you want to be telling your grandkids about cold trickle. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7592.34s)]
*  Does the wheelchair race scene not hit as hard? No, it's harder. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7596.74s)]
*  It's harder. Yeah, it's great. We broke it down. Anyway, that's tomorrow. Then on Prestige TV, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7601.38s)]
*  The White Lotus, episode five, which is a capital B banger, which you got to watch tonight. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7608.26s)]
*  Capital B, pulsating in bullet banger. I'm watching it. I am on it. I needed something [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7615.14s)]
*  after the Ruby Franke documentary, which I would suggest maybe not watching. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7621.46s)]
*  Adolescence on Netflix is good too. Check that out. Anyway, Bricello, good to see you. See you. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8L17mSD_A&t=7627.14s)]
