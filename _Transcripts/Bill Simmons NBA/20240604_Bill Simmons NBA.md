# NBA Media Narratives, Studio Shows, and More! | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5fotU62nV8)
*  Hey Curtis, we were talking in part one about media narratives and glass half
*  full glass half empty type of stuff that's going on.
*  So Dallas is in the glass half full zone with media takes, right?
*  Cause everybody's so excited for the Luca piece of it and the Kyrie
*  rehabilitation slash resurgence and the Celtics are in the glass half empty
*  zone of, eh, I know these guys records, but, and there's like a, yeah, but, um,
*  do you feel like this whole cycle happens faster than it used to happen?
*  Is this like instantaneously in 12 hours, all of a sudden the glass half full
*  glass half empty happens.
*  It's probably generally true though.
*  I think the Celtics part of it has lasted basically throughout the
*  playoffs, cause there's just not that much to say.
*  Yeah, that's a good point.
*  I mean, what, what's your, you know, what was your storyline, you know, after
*  they law, after the Pacers lost game one and the series looked like it was going
*  to be really fun for about five minutes.
*  Well, what else was there to say?
*  And then, you know, Halliburton gets hurt and like all the only take right
*  there is to start to just poke at the Celtics.
*  Oh, these guys aren't that good.
*  They haven't played anybody.
*  Stars keep getting hurt.
*  So I think it's almost at a boredom if anything else.
*  Yeah.
*  We're still a little Chris Ryan mentioned to me, he was like, it seems
*  like you haven't had as much fun talking basketball during the playoffs as you
*  did during the football season.
*  And I was like, well, I was ready to have fun, but I don't, I mean, the
*  East was pretty awful, right?
*  Even like the Nick series, which seemed like it was super fun.
*  And then by the time we got to game seven, the Knicks are running on fumes
*  and ESPN is doing that.
*  The Stephen A show basically for the final game.
*  And it was like, this isn't fun at all.
*  Uh, West was a little more fun and then it kind of flamed out, but I would say
*  if we're going to rank the playoffs, would you rank this on the lower end
*  for Silla since we started doing this?
*  Oh yeah.
*  I mean, no question.
*  My favorite series other than Minnesota, Denver is New York, Philly.
*  I mean, I loved that round one loved it.
*  And okay.
*  See Dallas is there, uh, as far as entertainment, we had close games
*  with Dallas and Minnesota, but it just, I think it was like, Oh, Minnesota's
*  just not ready for this whole entire time.
*  So yeah, the bot, but it's also speaks to the Boston part of it.
*  When the season started, Hey, who has the most on the line now?
*  And it's Boston, which team, if they don't win a title, it feels like
*  it's a disappointing season.
*  Now I think there's an absurd version of that where, because I was back in
*  Boston listening to a lot of the local coverage, it's like, if they don't win,
*  well, what if they lose game seven at home and Donch its finds a way to get six
*  points in the last minute and a half.
*  You start sitting there going up.
*  This team's super disappointing again.
*  Of course there's a losing scenario where you'd feel like Boston doesn't
*  have to start questioning itself.
*  Their identity as an organization, but there's so much at stake for them
*  because they've been lingering here now for such a long time that there was no
*  way to enjoy it, especially once Butler Mitchell and Halliburton were gone.
*  So I'm not surprised at all.
*  And they've spent a crazy amount of money on it.
*  And a lot of things have broken their way.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, if that like Curtis, we should mention you're from a, the
*  great state of Texas, you followed this Mavs team.
*  If Dallas doesn't win the finals, I don't feel like it, you know, I don't
*  feel like the ramifications would be the same as the Celtics blowing this and
*  Dallas becoming the third biggest underdog in, since the merger in the NBA finals
*  to win a title and to come down from having lost 30 games in the regular, all
*  these beats, it would be a really bad loss for the Celtics and for the Mavs.
*  They'd be like, Hey man, Luca, it's coming.
*  It's going to happen.
*  And you know, I think you'd quickly move forward, right?
*  But how's, how's the, how's the city of Dallas treated in this team?
*  It's been so funny because and the last year, and I still consider myself culturally
*  a citizen of Dallas, Fort Worth and same way you guys do Boston.
*  I listen to sports radio down there all the time into last year.
*  Everybody's pissed off about the tanking end of last season.
*  Everybody wants Jason kid fired.
*  I was listening to the Dallas radio coverage of the draft this year.
*  Everybody pissed off when they took Derek Lively five points a game at Duke,
*  five rebounds, that's what we want.
*  I mean, it was, that was not a happy day of radio at all.
*  So, you know, and even till March, right?
*  When they, when they, when they put lively on the bench, put Gaffer in the starting
*  lineup, put Jones in the starting lab, the Mavericks go 16 to two.
*  Everybody just really perked up.
*  So it's not only a happy to be there finals.
*  It's a, there was just, again, this, this does not stretch back at all.
*  This is the opposite of what Ryan's talking about with Boston really just since
*  March hasn't been like, Hmm, maybe there's something there in this team.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like the happy surprise NBA finals team, which we don't get that often
*  because all we do is talk basketball every day.
*  I don't want to hear about anybody on coaches until they can once tell me they
*  like this coach who they think is really good on the 31 team, like this guy's a
*  really good coach or they won 30 games.
*  But now it's gone the other way where no one thought kid was any good.
*  And it's strictly about the fact, the story keeps being told over and over
*  again on all the playoff games.
*  He talks to the players, not as a coach, but as a player, he tells them what he
*  would do if he played, not what they should do and his timeouts before the
*  timeout that you lose automatically.
*  People are acting like he's second sitting there saying, I
*  think this world there there's more going on than just a flat line in the
*  horizon.
*  It may be spinning.
*  We could be on some, something that's shaped different.
*  He, I love.
*  Announcers love a couple of things and I'm well versed in this.
*  Well, they love a good time out the most.
*  A good time out is just right.
*  Right.
*  But not losing the timeout.
*  Everybody knows you're going to lose.
*  If you call that before you lose it, fucking brilliant.
*  Yeah.
*  Unbelievable.
*  And then the other thing they love from players is when there's say 14 left in
*  the shot clock is off and a guy got a really good look at the hoop and he goes,
*  ah, let me peel out here and waste time.
*  Run the clock and get a way worse.
*  Look, announcers fucking love that.
*  They're like smart.
*  There were still, he didn't want to give the other team a possession and he took
*  an awful shot as opposed to the wide open one.
*  Brilliant.
*  Well, the cousin of that is the two for one where somebody will jack up a 29 foot
*  over the hand in this space with 29 seconds left on the clock, like two for one.
*  It's fine.
*  It's good.
*  It's good.
*  It's like a hot court shot with 24 seconds from now.
*  Do you took one of the worst shots of the game at 29 seconds?
*  The reality is if they take a shot with three or four left in the shot clock, by
*  the time you corral the rebound, you have like four seconds to two for one.
*  There needs to be now Brian's like, am I supposed to be on this podcast?
*  Uh, there needs to be an understanding that it has to be over a certain
*  number left in the quarter and guys are like two seconds north of the shot clock.
*  Going,
*  but there's 40 seconds left.
*  It makes sense.
*  29 seconds left.
*  Maybe not as much.
*  I think 35 is maybe 35 sounds great.
*  Um, Curtis, I mean, we knew this would go in a bunch of different directions, but
*  the, the announcing during the playoffs, the studio stuff in the playoffs.
*  The discourse we get on TV now versus the discourse we get on podcasts that are so
*  much more hardcore and day to day can TV keep up anymore and where are we going
*  with this going forward?
*  I thought you were setting me up for JJ on Felgarn mass question.
*  I didn't hear that.
*  I, so that got, that got, uh, gnarly, right?
*  You traveled around a tad and it's what you're talking about.
*  These two different worlds colliding, which is a fascinating thing to me
*  about where we are right now.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, the NFL, it's really pronounced cause NFL studio shows still feel like
*  the 1994 studio show that I flipped on at home and when I had to go turn on the
*  TV, like, you know, Phil Sims, God bless Phil Sims, you know, Sayonara.
*  It's been a great run, but he was still doing Phil Sims on television.
*  And you know, the NBA shows you could argue, maybe that's a little, there's a
*  little more there and inside the NBA, which I'm sure we're going to talk about
*  as its own weather system, but we're just in this funny moment where you just
*  have a completely different conversation about basketball in one form versus the
*  other.
*  Well, and then the game, the game, telecasts feel different in some ways too,
*  because it just feels like we're between these two worlds where you can hear it
*  with the JJ Doris, uh, Breen telecasts where they're trying to be really
*  sophisticated at certain times, right?
*  And they're trying to throw numbers at us and strategy and stuff.
*  That's a little closer to the JJ side.
*  But then there'll be a, you know, somebody goes up by 20 and then it's like,
*  you know, and it kind of needed here was being Gundy just babbling about some
*  story in the 98, 99 Knicks and, and some guys having a good time and it feeling
*  like they're hanging out and having a podcast and it's that balance.
*  Like it feels like on TV, the balance, they're really having a trouble trying
*  to figure out what that balance is.
*  Cause on the one hand, what's your, what's your servant when you're doing
*  these daily TV shows.
*  It's like the video clip.
*  Was there a good headline?
*  Did you grab people with that two minutes?
*  Right.
*  It's Mike Greenberg showing, um, the shot of Jason Tatum.
*  Was he happy for Jalen Brown when he got the finals MVP?
*  I don't know.
*  What did you think?
*  And now we start going around the circle.
*  So they're doing that stuff, but then they're also trying
*  to educate you about basketball.
*  Are you happy with this stuff at this point?
*  Rosilla, where are you?
*  Uh, I know it's not for me.
*  And I've, I've learned this lesson over the last few years that I think the
*  drama, like, look, I'll actually defend first take here, the clip that made the
*  rounds was during the playoffs and then everybody's screen grabbed it.
*  Could Steven A score a point against LeBron James one-on-one?
*  All right.
*  Uh, how long is first take?
*  Is it two hours?
*  Is it three hours?
*  They're having fun with that.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Right.
*  So the point is it's like a really easy target to go, Oh, look at these guys.
*  And there's all these other amazing stories and it makes the rounds.
*  There's also a lot of just, I know I used to have it too, where I'd watch
*  certain shows and being like, it's amazing to think like, I'm not allowed
*  to be on that show because I don't fit into a perfect like cookie cutter deal.
*  And it was something I had an issue with for a long time, probably too long.
*  I remember Dan Patrick saying to me, like, what's wrong with you?
*  Why do you think you would be on that?
*  If you don't angle to be an anchor and host these shows, you're never
*  going to be on those shows.
*  Like you're basically an idiot for thinking that you can be on it.
*  Even though I think the rules of that have been stretched quite a bit with
*  people in non-traditional backgrounds being on opinion shows, covering some
*  of the major sports, right?
*  I no longer care about it now.
*  I've gotten over that part of it.
*  But so when I watch those shows, I know that they're not necessarily for me, but
*  I, I really think that we get the media coverage and we get the shows that we
*  actually want and no one wants to admit that we click on the dumb shit.
*  Okay.
*  If I were being totally transparent of like, I can't believe I clicked on this
*  story, but it was a well-crafted headline.
*  It was a little vague.
*  I had to know the fucking answer.
*  I had to know if Maury had the results and that guy was the dad, but inherently,
*  I think we all as educated as you may find yourself as, as you age and try to
*  angle your, your interest in a more refined things, sometimes we still want to
*  know if that guy's the fucking dad.
*  And that's a lot of the sports coverage.
*  And I think it's okay.
*  And the reason this is programmed that way is because that's what we want,
*  whether it's the broadcast teams, whether it's the big names of the guy that just
*  retired, because if you don't know who that person is, you're like, who's that
*  guy and that's how they program these things.
*  And it's also the way they still structure.
*  We could go over all these different topics and questions and be like that show
*  stupid, or this is a dumb question, whatever.
*  I think the audience actually always wants this stuff.
*  And I've, I've come to that epiphany years ago and I repeat it probably too often.
*  To me, what's, what's even more interesting is the way they've gone the opposite
*  direction.
*  So when you're watching ESPN's number one team and JJ Reddick is really trying to
*  get some X's and it was basketball into a telecast, which by the way, is a really
*  hard in a basketball game because you don't have much time to talk and really,
*  really hard when you have a three person booth and there's not enough time really
*  for either analyst to get their stuff in there.
*  You know, he's like, that's a peel screen.
*  I'm sitting there, somebody who loves basketball, but doesn't engage with like
*  you guys do going so peel screen, whoop Google.
*  Let me figure out what that is real quick.
*  And you know, again, that's about, and he's a newish announcer.
*  So Greg Olson do a little bit of this when he first started and then he started
*  going like, you know what, I'm going to give you the X's and O's, but I'm just
*  actually going to throw away all the terminology and explain to you what happened
*  on a play.
*  Like we don't need that.
*  We don't need terms.
*  That doesn't really help anybody here.
*  People that know what a peel screen is are going to recognize it anyway.
*  Let's just do terminology here, but they've tried to go the other way.
*  It feels like a little bit on that main ESPN Teleguise.
*  You know, the Greg Olson thing is an interesting comparison because I remember
*  that first year you wrote about it.
*  After the fact, you wrote a really good piece about Olson, how he figured out.
*  He almost had too much information.
*  Yes.
*  And he had to figure out every play.
*  I have five things to say.
*  Let me just figure out.
*  This is the whole conceded your piece.
*  Let me just figure out the best of these five things.
*  And that's what I'll say.
*  And I do feel a little about that with JJ, because obviously he's an incredibly
*  smart basketball guy and you can hear in the pod, but when you're doing the TV
*  and the games and you're trying to also appeal to people who are casual fans or
*  kind of fair weather fans and how do you shove the basketball down their throat
*  without shoving it down their throat?
*  You know, I guess my question with basketball is when that, when it's flying
*  back and forth like that, how much, how much do we need, you know, is it's almost
*  like the summer all style.
*  Is it better to have a little less?
*  That sometimes the, I don't, I don't really know what I want.
*  I know I haven't been completely happy with a broadcast in a while and I don't
*  really know what I want from it for solo, I guess, cause I'm watching the game.
*  Like they have all these all casts.
*  I can just tell you, I've never watched an all cast for basketball ever.
*  So it's not interested.
*  I want to hear the announcers and I want to hear the crowd and I don't really
*  want to be entertained by these people.
*  Like I actually want to watch the game, but I'm sure there's an audience for that
*  stuff too.
*  What do you want from it?
*  Oh man.
*  That's a, that's a tough answer because like, I think JJ is at his best when
*  he's pointing out what he feels.
*  Like there were certain moments I'd say in some of the Celtics games against the
*  Pacers, he was like, okay, it is noticeable that the defensive energy is cranked up
*  here and he's right there and he's watching it and it's such a simple thing.
*  But I don't know that that many color people are that good at, at pointing
*  that out immediately.
*  They may see a block and play the results of, oh, I'm going to be able to
*  play the results of, oh, the defensive intensity, but it was just the activity,
*  the movement fighting over screens, contesting more.
*  And he was a hundred percent right.
*  It wasn't like he was seeing it and it wasn't happening.
*  But then I think it's really tough because it's their first group, first year
*  together with this group and whatever you thought of the previous regime with
*  Van Gundy and Jackson and Breen, they'd been around for so long that they knew
*  each other's beats really well.
*  And I actually liked it when it got a little topical.
*  I like when there's a slow moment in a game where it can be.
*  They start just talking, talking about shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, Hey, what's going on?
*  I actually, maybe it's because of the podcasting thing with me.
*  I liked it.
*  So when people say, Oh great, you know, Saturday night's game turns into a podcast
*  again, well, if the game sucks, great.
*  I was, I was into it.
*  I was watching the UFC last night.
*  So Annick Rogan, DC, they are so good.
*  But allows you to have these moments where Strickland is kind of feeling
*  himself out, feeling out the opponent.
*  So there's not constant action.
*  And yet they're talking about, um, Costa and just kind of where he's at in his
*  career and you're getting all this awesome backstory and then making that
*  part of the observation and the actual call to fight and then these peak energy
*  moments when the action is being matched by how the announcers are.
*  And I was thinking to myself, I'm like, this is a brilliant broadcast of these
*  fights and these three guys are so good.
*  But I also think the sport allows her a little bit more weird Brian's
*  point on the basketball.
*  There's probably no perfect formula, but you can always tell Brian when somebody
*  shows up with way too much prep.
*  And when that happens, it's usually newer people that want to prove their worth.
*  And the most important thing you can ever learn in the broadcasting as somebody who
*  had to do play by play 20 something years ago, way too much prep talked way too
*  much, wasn't secure trying to prove myself.
*  And even somebody who has a 10 year career in the NBA, the first time they get that
*  position, you can tell when it's like, okay, it's just not comfortable.
*  And they're trying to prove that they belong here.
*  Or then you have the other side of the guy that's like, you wanted me to do prep.
*  I just played, like I don't need to.
*  The way you said about the UFC thing.
*  I think that's such a good point.
*  I think those guys are great together.
*  And in the Strickland cost of fight last night, Rogan Rogan was on it early.
*  He was like, I don't like this pace for him.
*  He's moving backwards.
*  Strickland's just, he's moving forward.
*  He's making them expend a lot of energy.
*  And I don't think cost is ready for this.
*  I think by, I think by the fourth, fifth rounds, then they start talking about,
*  did he make a mistake making this fight five rounds instead of three?
*  They were having all these conversations and Strickland hadn't even really taken
*  hold of the fight yet.
*  And then when it started happening in the third and fourth round, cause I was
*  watching with my son and my son was like, this is the right conversation.
*  Like this is like, I don't think cost that I don't know why he didn't do three
*  rounds and they were just tapping in a shit.
*  I don't, the point is with basketball, Brian, I don't, it's, it's so back and
*  forth and so fast, it would be really hard to explore the studio space like that.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, it's, it's funny.
*  And I know I'm preaching the choir here, Bill, Bill, but it's really weird that
*  we've decided that every major basketball game in the United States needs three
*  announcers.
*  These are all good announcers.
*  So I'm not, I'm not, I'm not killing anybody here, but Turner, three
*  announcers for the conference finals, ESPN, three announcers for all the big
*  games, the final four, three announcers.
*  There's just not that much time.
*  And it's, and again, it's not, it's not a shot at anybody so much.
*  It's just like, you have this tiny window where you can talk about something.
*  It's a play by play announcer sports.
*  So when you have two analysts and they're both trying to get their stuff in there
*  and then inevitably they start talking to each other.
*  One of them makes the point.
*  The other person says, I agree.
*  And I'm like, okay, thanks.
*  You know, wanted to know what you, what the other person thought of that point as
*  we, you know, swing down the court the other way.
*  It's just, it's too crowded to me.
*  It just is absolutely too crowded.
*  There's also something else I've noticed with Doris is that she's so wants to be
*  so respectful of JJ because of his career and that he just finished up playing and
*  he's still very connected to so many players that it's almost like she doesn't
*  want JJ to feel that she's getting in her way, but then in a way it's almost
*  fucking her up a little bit.
*  And I don't know if it's not even about her ability because we know how great she
*  can be, but I think it's tough to be like, Hey, new group finals, figure it out.
*  And she's doing something that's actually, yeah, it's commendable.
*  Cause I think she's being incredibly gracious to JJ, but she's not getting to
*  be the best version of herself because I think she wants him to flourish.
*  And that's what I've noticed.
*  So I remember writing about this with the first one.
*  I had my digital city, Boston column, one of those finals, Doug Collins was doing
*  the games and then they added Isaiah.
*  I think it was Isaiah or magic.
*  It was one of them.
*  It started with Isaiah.
*  Then they hired Doug Collins, I think because of,
*  Oh, that, yeah, that's right.
*  It was the three of them.
*  And one of the tips, I love that he knew that immediately.
*  One of the tips you can look at when you know, the threesome hasn't
*  clicked is they'll come out of timeouts or even when they're talking and they'll
*  say each other's names to try to make it seem like they're balls moving around.
*  It'd be like, right.
*  And, and, and Brian, that's what has to happen when you're protecting the rim.
*  That's right, Bill.
*  That is what has to happen.
*  And then they go and it's like, Oh, this isn't working.
*  And I look, I, I thought being good to me and Jackson and Breen, um, I, you know,
*  they kind of went sideways a little bit for me the last couple of years, but
*  mainly because Jackson was out of the league too long and I like hearing at
*  least one person on the broadcast.
*  Who's either coached or played against the guys that I'm watching within the
*  last couple of years, cause I think that's the biggest asset, but one of the
*  things that was good about them was they had, it really sounded like those guys
*  went to dinner together.
*  They hung out together.
*  They might vacation together.
*  And then when they were doing the game, you felt that
*  camaraderie and that chemistry.
*  And I do think that's important.
*  It's a really hard thing to build.
*  Then it's a really hard thing to build in four or five months, especially like
*  I've announced a couple of NBA games and it goes so much faster than you realize.
*  Like I say, Oh my God, we're at the seven minute timeout.
*  Like I've made two points.
*  And so when you have a third person there, it's just flying by and then
*  they're talking in your ear and it's really choppy and weird.
*  So you got to rely on that chemistry.
*  But Brian, your original point, I don't know why it's not just two people.
*  I don't know how we got to three.
*  I don't know who made the decision.
*  I don't know when people looked at each other, like even TNT in the,
*  what, in the conference finals, they're like, Stan VanGaun and Reggie Miller.
*  They've never worked together all year.
*  These are our guys and they're with Kevin Harland.
*  It's like, just pick one.
*  Why not?
*  They did it last year too.
*  It was the same thing.
*  And by the way, as people have looked at the new crews, they've, I've seen some
*  strange new respect for Mark Jackson coming up in a few places.
*  Come back.
*  Hey, you know, Mark, we had some issues with Mark Jackson, but I'm like, I'm sorry.
*  I'm out.
*  Right.
*  Hey, we're all good.
*  Thank you very much for, for, for going to that one.
*  We're, we're, we're fine.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know that we've ever had this depth of play by play guys.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  How many play by play guys across all sports and all networks where I go, this
*  is, this is a loaded era better than the nineties.
*  No, it's well, it's a little like what happened with the NBA where the older
*  guys are still really good, but then this new crop of dudes came in.
*  Like they said, NBC for the Olympics is going to have Noah Eagle and Dwayne
*  Wade, just the two of them.
*  I'm like, that sounds great.
*  No, no Eagle Dwayne Wade, no third person that were awkwardly like pushing
*  in in some way and just, they'll just call the game, the games will have.
*  Certain flows, but this goes back to a topic that we've talked about over and
*  over again, it's like, I don't know why TV producers and the people oversee this
*  stuff can't stay out of their own way.
*  Sometimes.
*  And we saw this with inside the NBA and Russell and I talked about it last week
*  where it's just like, we just were doing this victory lap of what an awesome show
*  this has been for us for 20 plus years.
*  And then over and over again, they have to put a fifth guy in when the stakes get
*  bigger, this happened with the ESPN's women's basketball team.
*  During the, during the college tournament, everyone was like these, this
*  three person team to have is great.
*  Like it was really jumped out.
*  It was like, this is awesome.
*  And then when we got to the final four, what happens all of a sudden, it's a
*  five person thing, it's like these guys, they can't help themselves.
*  The people that oversee it.
*  It's like, they almost want to feel like they did something.
*  So their boss is like, what are we doing for the final four?
*  Uh, we're going to add Dawn Staley.
*  Great.
*  That sounds good.
*  And it's like, you know what?
*  You had a really good team already.
*  Why did they do this?
*  Curtis?
*  It's really strange.
*  And the thing I hate about it, I think I saw this, it had definitely happened
*  with Draymond, heard you guys talking about this, but also with CP3 on ESPN,
*  which is everything then has to be about the new guy.
*  Yeah.
*  So they're going to like, Hey Chris, when you were playing in the playoffs and
*  you were in a high leverage situation, when you were feeling pressure, that
*  that was like, first of all, it's like, who wrote this question?
*  Thank you very much.
*  But everything is then about his playoff career.
*  And I'm like, you're an interesting guy.
*  I want to hear you talk.
*  That's cool.
*  But this is not about you right now.
*  We've actually got really, really big basketball in front of us.
*  And the conversation should be about that.
*  And I hate when that happens.
*  In addition to, as you see a producer get in the way and just needing to add
*  something for the most important basketball games of the year that we didn't need.
*  Then it always becomes about the new guy because they start asking about his
*  career and I'm just like, I don't want this.
*  When the five person, the five person studio show, we just have 50 plus
*  years of evidence that it fails.
*  It fails for the same reason.
*  Uh, I just did a podcast.
*  I don't want to step on for rewatchables where we talked about the power of
*  four sums and four and four people.
*  When you go to dinner, four people is always the best number.
*  Four people is always the best number for a studio show.
*  There's just certain things where four golf foursum is much better than
*  playing with three people.
*  Then one person's by themselves in a cart.
*  Um, the, the four just works and I don't know why they would mess with that.
*  As the stakes get bigger and the audience gets bigger, that's when they add the fifth
*  person.
*  I actually wanted to hear from Chris Paul's interesting, but at that point, you
*  just have to bump one of the people on the show.
*  They just pick one.
*  Somebody's got to go.
*  Were we going to say, Rossello?
*  Well, I have like specific Curtis questions on just understanding some of
*  this stuff in that we keep like seeing these old bits for inside the NBA and
*  it's, it's coming back next year.
*  We drew, we think, why don't you two guys talk this out?
*  Cause I don't know.
*  So it is cut.
*  We have another year left on the NBA rights deal.
*  So we're inside the NBA.
*  Yeah.
*  So NBA will, the plan is that that will be on tour next year.
*  But.
*  Okay.
*  What was the time?
*  What was it?
*  College football?
*  What was the one where they lost it?
*  And then the, the people just said with a year left to go fuck it, just take it now.
*  The SEC CBS thing.
*  No, but, but CBS held onto it for that extra year.
*  They wanted that last year.
*  Yeah.
*  Didn't ESPN try to buy the last year or something?
*  I thought that was one where they just said, screw it.
*  Just take it now.
*  Thursday night football went from Fox to Amazon a year early.
*  That might be what you're talking about.
*  Yes, that's what it is.
*  I'm just, I'm prepared for anything because it's to me so crazy that.
*  Warner didn't keep the NBA to begin with and watching them for the last month, pretend
*  that they're still in this and, oh, well we have the right to match.
*  It's like, this was done a month ago.
*  This is where I went on the town and we did the whole thing.
*  This was done.
*  They lost it.
*  And now the reporting that's come out since about, uh, I think Lucas Shaw was the first
*  one to report the NBA was like, give us two, three, and you have it during the exclusive
*  period.
*  And Warner's like, Nope, two, one, you're taking games away from us.
*  And they're like, okay, cool.
*  And they left and immediately got two, five per year from NBC and that's it.
*  And they're going to lose it.
*  And so when I think like how badly that was botched, I just like, would it surprise me
*  if they're like, fuck it, take this off our hands a year early and we'll redistribute
*  the money somewhere else and go after like UFC or whatever they like.
*  I just, I'm prepared for anything.
*  You never, the lame duck season for coaching, for TV properties, it always gets a little
*  weird.
*  I'm just, I'm, I'm not ruling it out is my point.
*  I hear you.
*  It is cheaper this year than the money we're talking about.
*  I mean, it's significantly cheaper.
*  So they have a cheap year, just like CBS just did with the SEC.
*  Also, if your existential fear at Turner is that cable operator is going to be like,
*  Hey, we don't need you anymore because there's nothing on your network.
*  Why would you want to speed up that process?
*  Surely you'd want to give yourself an extra year of cover while you figure out what are
*  we going to put on TNT to make sure this is still a viable cable network, at least as
*  any viable as any cable network.
*  What if you could get twice as much money than what you're paying to get rid of it a
*  year early?
*  Maybe in your, your company has a lot of debt like Warner Brothers does.
*  Is this is wait, is this media reporter bill?
*  The one that broke the news about Turner being out?
*  Cause I want to know who I'm talking to here.
*  No, it's not media reporter.
*  But this is just, I'm prepared for anything.
*  Great question by a reporter though.
*  Great job by Brian.
*  Right.
*  No, I, I, this is I'm prepared for anything bill because when it came out that for two,
*  three, they could have locked down the NBA and they just decided not to.
*  That makes me think you are making decisions solely for money at this point.
*  If you're making decisions solely for money, would you pedal off the last year of your
*  deal for twice as much 10 BC and just say, take this year early, give us money.
*  Okay.
*  It's not out of the realm for me.
*  Okay.
*  So when skipper did the decade long deal for the rights in the mid teens, it was
*  immediately met with like, are you out of your mind?
*  Right.
*  You tripled it.
*  And it turned out that he was totally right.
*  Deserves all the credit nailed it because he was, I'll never forget
*  my first meeting ever with him.
*  It was, Hey, you've been on the air a bunch of years, finally, probably worth
*  getting to know you for 60 minutes.
*  And then he kind of like laid out his philosophy of live rights and all of these
*  things.
*  And I just remember going, okay, I'll never look at this the same way because this
*  guy spent this much time explaining this shit to me.
*  And now I get, and you never knew what skipper it's like, does he want me as, as
*  one of the people that's on the air at the time, all like the ESPN, does he want
*  me hearing his side of it?
*  So that then I leave that meeting going, you know, who's a genius is this John
*  skipper.
*  Have you met him?
*  So really never knew.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  So I always thought there was a little bit of that in there, but clearly his call
*  was the right call long-term on the rights part of it.
*  But there's also all of the ESPN programming that needs to be filled to be
*  in the relationships with it.
*  Then there's also like different weird stuff with sports center that I never knew
*  about that when you have the rights, then that means you can also show the replays
*  in a way where the NFL had some real restrictions.
*  It's like, if you don't, if you're not in business with them, then it limits all
*  these other things you can do with repurposing any of the broadcast stuff.
*  So the reason I'm even setting this up and I'm going to need another second here.
*  I remember the nets were being purchased.
*  Bruce Ratner was doing the big real estate deal and it may even been a
*  Grantland piece.
*  Okay.
*  It was one of those awesome long form pieces.
*  I think that's where I'm ready.
*  Yeah, they were awesome.
*  And it was Ratner said something I'm sure other owners hated because he was
*  basically putting this undetermined number of value on what a franchise was.
*  Like we can come up with what it's worth money in money out, but this is a
*  painting.
*  This is something I can say that I own.
*  And I'm one of the few people in the world that has one of these things.
*  And it's like the worst argument ever for ownership.
*  Uh, when it comes to like CBA stuff with players.
*  And the reason I try to set these two things up here, which I'm taking too
*  long doing is that I don't know where the numbers can keep going, but clearly
*  there's something where it's, it's worth beyond what it is for just the money in
*  money out of what you're selling the commercials for on these broadcasts.
*  That if you're not in business with one of them, then you're not really serious.
*  That you're not a real station.
*  They don't have Pat summer all giving you a promo, a house of bugging as you're
*  coming back from commercial right before a kickoff, after a touchdown that there
*  have to be all these other baked in values that the TV people understand as
*  the numbers continue to go up in a way that no one can ever shoot too high of a
*  projection for.
*  You really agree.
*  Thank you for the house of bugging all new.
*  Fox and then Malcolm in the middle.
*  No, but I think you're right.
*  And look, David's as love the guy running Warner Brothers discovery was sitting
*  court side with the Knicks right for all those games.
*  So surely he, of all people should realize that there is something about
*  being in business with the NBA.
*  I think the question that's interesting there is, and it goes back to that, what
*  you said about Skipper, did we think the NBA was necessarily on this tier, right?
*  Like that is something I feel that's happened.
*  You all three of us probably heard rumors throughout this process with the NBA
*  media rights at this number was going to come in much lower than it's actually
*  going to come in at that.
*  Maybe the entry built.
*  Okay.
*  Bill was out, but maybe this number wouldn't be three times over 7 billion a
*  year.
*  It wouldn't quite get to that moment.
*  I don't know.
*  So there's a look just to jump in though.
*  When guys started selling their teams, I was like, wait, what's happening here?
*  The Cuban.
*  That was the right.
*  So it just, it was sorta odd that like the TV rumors that were coming out, like,
*  and I don't know if it was a Boris thing where they throw out such an absurd
*  number that when you pay a few billion, you feel like you're actually getting a
*  deal based on the earliest projections of what the rights were going to cost.
*  But then when you had multiple teams going through turnover and then rumors of
*  like a couple other ones that we keep hearing about being like local younger or
*  older owners, local, like they're going to have to sell out like the money's too
*  much.
*  Now I was starting to believe that the number was going to come in at a number
*  that was really disappointing and that obviously didn't happen.
*  So keep going, Brian.
*  No, no.
*  And I just, I just think the NFL was always in that we want to be in, this is
*  our painting.
*  We want to be in business with this guys.
*  It always has value.
*  The NBA was another tier lower, right?
*  But now you look at these numbers and it's, you know, Amazon wants to be in
*  that business.
*  So who doesn't want to be in that business?
*  Yeah.
*  The biggest thing you brought up Skipper 10 years ago, there were less suitors 10
*  years ago, right?
*  The who, like it was always going to be ESPN and TNT.
*  There was no like renegade third person that was going to come in over the top
*  rope.
*  So there were some thoughts, maybe FS one, maybe Fox.
*  Yeah.
*  Fox.
*  NBC wasn't in there because they had just spent a shitload on football.
*  And it, you kind of always knew where it was going with the two this time around
*  was different because you had way more suitors and Apple never even got involved,
*  which I think was a surprise even to a lot of people that were at Apple.
*  I think Apple thought that the MLS and some of the other stuff they were on the
*  sports side was a gateway to them getting in hard in the NBA.
*  But I think, um, the, the big thing that I think Warner missed on, because I'm
*  not positive they wanted to lose the NBA.
*  I think, I think they're struggling for money big time.
*  I don't think they saw the NBC thing coming.
*  I think John Arand has a theory in this that I think, I think he's right.
*  The Brian Roberts, the guy who runs Comcast.
*  There was always a feeling with him that he's the guy in your fantasy draft.
*  Matt Bell and I talked about this on his part, but he's the guy in your fantasy
*  draft who drives up the prices on like the receivers and he's like 51 for
*  Jamar chase and like, fuck 52.
*  And then he backs out and saw all of a sudden you have Jamar chase at 52.
*  And like, fuck, he did it to me again.
*  I should have known.
*  And I think they felt like NBC, but wasn't a serious suitor for it.
*  And it turns out they were, and they just missed it.
*  And NBC was willing to go.
*  Everyone knew Amazon was coming in and everyone knew ESPN wanted to keep it.
*  See if three partners, not two, they were able to split the games and the packages
*  and all this shit up so that they end up getting to that 7 billion figure.
*  To me, this is why they waited on expansion.
*  Cause I think deep down, they knew this was sitting there.
*  And I think the owners were like, if we're going to expand, you got to wait
*  till after the media deal, cause then we'll actually know what we're splitting up.
*  Um, but to me, it's just a miscalculation by Zaslav.
*  I don't think he saw the NBC thing coming.
*  I think he saw Amazon.
*  I don't think he saw NBC.
*  There's a flip side though, Brian, where maybe he wanted to lose it all along.
*  Maybe, I mean, it is a lot of money and what we're still is laying out about.
*  It's a little bit of a vanity purchase.
*  Like basically you're hoping to break even, but it lifts up all these other
*  parts of what you're doing.
*  And if you're trying to cut costs left and right, maybe you don't need a vanity
*  purchase, right?
*  By the way, it's a ton of money and I don't pretend to be an expert, you know,
*  in every part of corporate finance, but you're paying 2.5 billion or more.
*  For the old Turner package, which is not as good as Turner's old package.
*  It's a worst package.
*  Plus it's all that money.
*  Plus all the production stuff.
*  Plus the salary is very, very, that works for you.
*  And the ratings, which is hilarious.
*  Cause like I've thought about this where, okay, ratings are down.
*  Ratings can change.
*  Like it's kind of hard to package the ratings in a way where you
*  don't see some kind of decline.
*  It's just a matter of how extreme you want to believe the decline is there or
*  how much you would say, well, with new technology and all this stuff that you
*  can't look at these numbers anymore.
*  Okay.
*  Well, it appears that the buyers weren't as concerned about those numbers, or
*  maybe it just gets back to the live audience argument where it's like the
*  traditional number can be down, but if the percentage applied at the audience
*  continues to go up based on other options, then it's still just as valuable.
*  Like this isn't a great analogy, but like the worst town still
*  has to have the best house.
*  And with this, you can say, well, where were your ratings five, 10 years ago?
*  It's like, okay, but that's actually irrelevant because there isn't something
*  else that provides this much inventory.
*  That still is going to have these moments, which I also think was a big part of
*  silver wanting to model some of the stuff for like more event moments.
*  And that's why I think college basketball has just basically waved the flag and
*  gone, we at least have our moment that matters for three weeks, uh, baseball
*  postseason, baseball postseason has been an incredible product now for a bunch of
*  years, except for the one year where like half the teams get in, but the baseball
*  postseason is still one of my favorite things, but that might be their NCAA
*  tournament through all the other inventory that you're sifting through
*  going, this is just never, there's not going to be a world where it exists.
*  That this is as important as it used to be.
*  Well, and that baseball package is coming up down the road where it's the
*  regular season versus the playoffs is at least with basketball, you can throw
*  up stars in the commercials and be like tonight, Anthony Edwards against
*  Luke at the odd church Friday night here on Amazon or whatever baseball.
*  You can't really do it.
*  You just can't.
*  Okay.
*  So I want to stay on the splitting this part up because once you got done
*  going through the NFL part of it, I'm like, what, where, like, you know, how
*  many of you have canceled your peacocks up?
*  So I'm sitting there going like they are, they are chopping it up
*  and taking it to the street.
*  Now, does that mean that the product is, is, is weaker?
*  Is this potentially a bad long-term plan to have everybody confused?
*  Where are the most valuable product and live television is, or is it just,
*  well, we'll worry about that on the next one, because if this many different
*  people want to pay us a combined total that outweighs just being partnered up
*  with just two providers, like I think the NFL and clearly the NBA, that seems
*  to be the league model right now.
*  And I'm always wondering five years from now, if some team or league goes more
*  so the league than any specific team is like, that was stupid.
*  Like the product was all over the place.
*  Well, don't you think Brian, don't you feel like a piece of this is going to
*  be the two league cable channels, the NFL network and NBA TV, basically taking
*  the games that were on those because they established those channels to try
*  to get the rights fees, but eventually those channels are going to become
*  ghost ships, like what happened to ESPN classic in the two thousands.
*  You take the games that were on those channels and you start selling them off
*  as one offs or five offs or whatever, and you just make way more money that way.
*  I feel like that's what's going to happen.
*  You disagree?
*  No, I think that's part of it.
*  And to Ryan, the flip side of Ryan's point is if you chop it up more ways, you
*  get more people promoting the NBA.
*  So all of a sudden you have Amazon running.
*  We know, we know you will take either Amazon or Netflix or hopefully both.
*  The NFL has gotten both NBA is working on it, right?
*  They get there in with Amazon.
*  You get NBC, which gets a bunch of your games off cable, which has been a big deal.
*  You can go find the quotes from David Stern 20 years ago going, we need to put
*  our games on cable because cable is the future.
*  We need to get them off broadcast.
*  We've now come all the way back around.
*  We're taking them off cable and putting them on broadcast.
*  But I do think there is a little bit of an NFL issue here, right?
*  I mean, the NFL carved it up as much as humanly possible.
*  And then it's like, Oh, look at all these jet games.
*  Look at all, look at all these Russell Wilson games.
*  This sucks.
*  These aren't, these aren't great nights.
*  And there will be nights like that in the NBA for sure under the new agreement.
*  So talking about this big NBA package, I thought a piece of this, because they're
*  getting so much more money than I think all of us to get to seven plus billion
*  for these packages is pretty nuts.
*  And I was thinking, this sounds like the perfect time to cut back now to 72 games
*  or 76 games, something like that.
*  And the NBA is like, Nope, it's still going to be 82 NFL.
*  Same thing.
*  Oh, you're making way more money on these one-off games.
*  Sounds like the perfect time maybe to drop the 18 games thing, right?
*  Cause that'll be terrible player safety.
*  Nobody, literally nobody wants it.
*  All of us love football.
*  Nobody wants an 18 game schedule.
*  They're going to do it.
*  Um, I, I don't know where any of this ends because you could talk, you could tell me
*  is it more realistic for the NBA to add regular season games or lose them.
*  And I gotta say, like, I could see them going when they have the two expansion
*  teams going to like 86 games instead of 82 versus going backwards.
*  The other way, these guys, they're just addicted to the cash and the money and
*  how much they can make from it.
*  It's never about what's good for the league.
*  Um, we're still at the 18 game NFL schedule.
*  Is there a bigger money grab you've ever heard of?
*  Well, no, I don't, I'm not surprised by any of this stuff.
*  Like the baseball argument I always hear was like, okay, so you don't watch
*  baseball now because the season is too long.
*  So if they cut it to one 40 or one 32, you're going to start watching.
*  Of course you're not.
*  You've already decided you're out of it.
*  So if I'm a baseball owner, it'd be like, stop bringing it up.
*  Yeah.
*  Like parking revenue.
*  Yeah.
*  We're selling hot dogs, you know, shirts are 60 bucks now in the stadium.
*  So guess what?
*  Like, and we're providing jobs.
*  So it's not happening.
*  Stop asking.
*  I mean, the basketball fascination with a shorter season from all the
*  basketball writers is like, find a new fucking topic.
*  I know.
*  It's not happening.
*  Myself.
*  Right.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  It's never happening.
*  There's basketball people that I've talked to, like, I agree with your premise bill.
*  I think the 72 game thing, I've seen it all mapped out like, Hey, great idea.
*  It's not happening.
*  This is not going in that direction.
*  Every single decision.
*  And I don't know.
*  I mean, everybody works like the high level of corporate America.
*  How would you do in a meeting?
*  And it's like, okay, what are we planning on doing?
*  Let's lay out the game plan for this year.
*  Hey, let's not make every dollar available to us.
*  Let's cut back because of just vibes.
*  Let's not try to make every last single dollar for shareholders and the
*  people that have invested in this company.
*  So the only difference is this all plays out publicly.
*  There's a different emotional attachment to it, but the NFL owners with their
*  track record of the last 10 years.
*  I mean, they make the NBA owners seem like the peace Corps.
*  So I don't, there's nothing the NFL owners can do anymore that would ever
*  surprise me about how much available cash they're going to go after.
*  And the consumer, as we talked about with like your decisions with what you
*  do and what you click on and the different shows and segments that you
*  guiltly watch, um, I think it's the same thing with football is they're like,
*  we'll we'd rather go too far with this and realize when we've made the mistake
*  than potentially leave anything on the table.
*  And that's what I think the NFL does with the way they operate.
*  What do you think, Brian?
*  It's what everybody does.
*  I mean, we decided in my lifetime that 64 teams was not enough to crown a college
*  basketball champion.
*  God, 64 wasn't enough.
*  We haven't even talked about college football.
*  Like when you think about what college football has done to their sport in such
*  a massive amount of times, it looks like the NFL stuck in the fifties.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I know.
*  College football plans can be a month long this year.
*  It's going to last a guy last night.
*  He's like, I played at Cal.
*  He's like, we're in the ACC.
*  He's like, I forgot again.
*  I forgot twice.
*  They were in the ACC.
*  Everything grows.
*  I mean, we, we say Cal's in the ACC.
*  Yeah.
*  Breaking news for Bill.
*  Jesus.
*  This is why I feel great about not following college sports.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess if you're comparing anything, if you're comparing a beer and a photo of
*  college sports, you're feeling great.
*  It's doing a hundred times better.
*  What happens to college sports?
*  Do we just end up with like 32 major programs and that's it?
*  Well, I think we're going to have it.
*  Everybody else's div three.
*  Right.
*  It'll go to some extreme where, I mean, you think the NFL owners, I mean, you
*  have school presidents with no governing body just deciding to do whatever they
*  want to do and they get on the phone.
*  And then all of a sudden you have Cal in the ACC because of all these other
*  dominoes that have fallen, but I don't care how outdated I sound.
*  I don't care how old I sound.
*  I think there is a line which you could pass in the structure of some of these
*  decisions that are made where you're like, Hey, we went too far.
*  It's like the Tebow coverage at ESPN.
*  They were like, we can't get enough of it.
*  It does numbers.
*  The data backs it up.
*  Tebow Tebow Tebow.
*  And I was like, you know, I think everybody's fucking sick of this Tebow topic.
*  I think people are pretty sick of it.
*  And like, Nope, keep doing it.
*  And the play there was we will do it until we've made a mistake doing it too
*  much instead of not doing it enough, which is basically what I just said
*  about the money part of it.
*  So when I look at college football, I don't think they give a shit about any
*  of it anymore and there may be this super league and then I'd like to think
*  there'll be some correction 10 years after that happens, or like, you know,
*  it was kind of fun where geographically and culturally it felt like there was
*  10 to 12 schools that all kind of matched what it was like to be from that part of
*  the country.
*  I missed that.
*  And that's what I loved about college football.
*  And that's what I hate about what's happened.
*  Curtis is sad.
*  Curtis loves college football.
*  What conference is Texas in?
*  Are you in like the Patriot league now?
*  I will say I'm sad, but on the other hand, I looked at Texas's schedule the other
*  day.
*  It's like, wow, we're playing Georgia this year, playing Florida.
*  We've got two of our old rivals back Arkansas and A and M we're playing at
*  Michigan at the beginning of the season.
*  I'm like, that sounds like the super league is here.
*  And you know, I, I totally co-sign everything Ryan just said, but also I'm
*  looking forward to all those games.
*  It's going to be awesome.
*  Can we talk about inside the NBA?
*  Yes.
*  I really want to talk to you.
*  You just wrote about this.
*  Um, you wrote about Barkley and the theory of people who publicly negotiate
*  their contracts, which is a new, a new trend that we're seeing, which I'm
*  surprised people are interested in.
*  Uh, Barkley seems pissed off more than anything.
*  I think, I think he was led to believe that they were keeping it.
*  And, um, now he's looking at all these people and he's talked about it.
*  He's looking at all these people he's worked with for the last two decades.
*  And I just think he felt like this was going to be a situation.
*  I'm just going to keep going, going, going.
*  And now all of a sudden this person, he barely knows is taking basketball away.
*  Um, what happens to the show going forward?
*  What happens to Barkley?
*  Do you, does it stay together?
*  What are your instincts?
*  So he was going to keep going, going, going, except every three or four
*  years he would say, yeah, I'm going to retire.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it would come by and be like, well, here's a huge new contract, not to
*  retire, so please, please don't retire.
*  So he would, he's going to do that.
*  But, you know, it's funny to me because I think we all love inside so much.
*  And I'm, and I'm one of, one of these people that we think the only way these
*  TV friends would ever break up is if some asshole executive breaks them up.
*  That's the only way.
*  If you actually listen to what Charles Barkley says and has done going back to
*  two years ago, when he shopped himself to live golf and to possibly leave Turner,
*  we all kind of memory hold that one.
*  Right.
*  It's like, if live golf gives me a huge pain, I'm just going to have to go.
*  And that's, that's just the way it is.
*  If you listen to what he says, his whole thing has been like, I want to make a
*  great deal for myself and I don't, by the way, I don't begrudge him that at all.
*  He is a, he is great at what he does.
*  He is the biggest star on that program.
*  He has more worth and more leverage than everybody on that program combined.
*  Right.
*  So he can go make the big deal he wants.
*  So to me, the question about inside going forward is what is Charles Barkley's
*  interest in keeping the band together?
*  He's the guy that's going to, it's not going to be Amazon say, Hey, we want
*  everybody, it's going to be Amazon or somebody going to Charles Barkley and
*  say, what's important to you is it.
*  What's important to you that you get the absolute best deal or is it important
*  to you that we bring everybody with you?
*  That that's what you want.
*  And to me, he, he holds this whole thing in his hands because he's that big of a
*  star.
*  Well, the one thing that seems pretty certain is that Ernie is going to
*  retire with Turner because he's been there forever.
*  And, you know, he's at a later stage of his career and it's under contract with
*  them.
*  He's doing other stuff with them and it seems like it's a super important thing
*  for him, but I also wouldn't be surprised by anything.
*  Um, it also might be a good career move for Barkley to branch out and be with a
*  different group of people.
*  Just he's been, what's the difference between 23 years, 17 years, 12, once you
*  get past like 10, 12 years of everybody together, maybe it is an interesting
*  career thing for him.
*  On the other hand, he just tried a career move with that Gale King show and that
*  thing lasted, you know, 10 weeks.
*  So sometimes when you're a part of something special, maybe you try to keep
*  that.
*  How do you see playing out?
*  We're so well, everybody knows he's my favorite athlete of all time and.
*  Probably, you know, one of the coolest things is getting to know him over the
*  years and have a mom.
*  But when I had him on, I think it was just a year ago when I was in Chicago for
*  the combine, I think it was a year ago.
*  It could have been two years ago.
*  Um, he was basically telling me he wasn't going to do this much longer and Curtis
*  lays it out perfectly.
*  The timeline in this piece that's up on the ringer now.
*  And I would say the lesson that I think is, is the most correct lesson I've ever
*  learned in this business is if you're younger and there's an older guy that's on
*  the air and a manager says, Hey, that guy's probably not going to resign after
*  this year.
*  He's going to call it quits.
*  It's the most untrue thing in any profession.
*  That guy never goes anywhere.
*  He just keeps resigning because think about his life.
*  Like, Hey, do you want to make another 20 million next year?
*  Working.
*  Great.
*  And he works more than one day a week when you factor in all the incidentally
*  tournament stuff that they do.
*  But I'm always fascinated by Barkley.
*  Like I have a Barkley theory that if you're just yourself long enough, once you
*  get through the rough patches, then everybody catches up to you and then you
*  no longer have to be anybody else.
*  Like you don't have to worry about what you say.
*  Like if you say things that rub people the wrong way long enough and you haven't
*  lost your job in the air, you can then just survive forever.
*  And everybody's Howard Stern theory.
*  Yeah.
*  Howard Stern, you pass a point where you just, you just get to say whatever you
*  want and it's okay.
*  Like him saying before the Western Conference finals, like I haven't been in
*  Minneapolis in 20 years.
*  They're like, dude, you're here.
*  Curtis puts it in Curtis speak for your column because I don't want to quote it.
*  He was there five years ago and his alma mater Auburn was playing in the final four.
*  So it seems sort of not like a thing you would forget.
*  He must not have had a great weekend.
*  People love Barclay.
*  Nobody's going to call him out.
*  No, it doesn't.
*  And it doesn't matter.
*  Right?
*  Like that's the whole thing.
*  All right.
*  But here's, here's, I think this is a good connection to what we've been talking
*  about with every last dollar and where do the TV rights keep going and all this
*  stuff.
*  We've seen massive single contracts for people, whether it's the Aikman buck
*  deal, the Brady deal, like new levels where when you thought you were making
*  like a couple million bucks for one of these jobs, you're like, I'm killing it.
*  And I'm having a great life.
*  I think the peak content people have completely reset the market at the higher
*  ends.
*  Like where does this keep going?
*  Where, like, do you ever hear, like, do you ever have anybody in your world that
*  talks to you kind of off the record?
*  I don't even know if you can share this with us where it's the person's becoming
*  the vanity hire where you may not even be able to figure out how to recoup all of
*  that money.
*  Like, is there a number where Barclay isn't actually worth it?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think I hear that from, from people in the business all the time,
*  especially from a kind of person that's the executive, but not the executive
*  running the place.
*  Right.
*  And clearly, clearly at ESPN, right.
*  Like Jimmy Pataro has decided this is the strategy, right?
*  There were clearly people, let us say the executive level at ESPN, we're like, Oh,
*  is that the strategy?
*  Is this where we're really going in on one, two, three Ford here?
*  Is that, is that it?
*  So yeah, all the time.
*  And look, if, if ESPN were to hire Barclay and put them on the pregame show, you're
*  really going to have $40 million a year in salaries on the NBA pregame show.
*  Cause Steven is not going anywhere.
*  They've proven they don't really care about because they have two minutes, two
*  minutes, like, I would say to
*  Pataro, let them be on the air for a little while.
*  Like, the greatness of the TNT studio show, by the way, I don't even know
*  what the ratings are.
*  Everybody raised about it.
*  What are the actual ratings?
*  But they, they come back and they give them the freedom to actually have
*  real fucking conversations.
*  There's a, there's a looseness to that, a lack of structure because you can't
*  have structure with those guys.
*  Those guys would revolt against structure.
*  And then I see these other, these shows try to do it.
*  It's like, what are you doing?
*  You don't even have this.
*  You're not allowing your on air people to even have the same taste
*  of real estate as these guys.
*  That's what I was, when I was doing the studio show, that was always what I
*  was talking to Curtis about.
*  I was like, this finally makes sense to me.
*  We're coming at a halftime and like a game seven of, you know, some series
*  final, and you have two and a half minutes to talk like you were, you were
*  saying this on ESPN and they had Chris Paul there, they'd five people at a
*  halftime show and it was like two hours or two minutes and 10 seconds.
*  And Steven eight was one of the people.
*  So, you know, he's going to go for at least a minute and then they
*  got to work Chris Paul and see, you might as well take the other two.
*  Poor Bob Myers.
*  I don't, I don't know if his usage rate was too high.
*  You know, I went, uh, I look back, I wrote, I wrote about inside the NBA
*  and spring of 2002 for page two.
*  It was the first year I was at page two and I went down to Atlanta and I did a
*  two-part piece about it, talking about how it was the greatest studio, greatest
*  sports studio show of all time.
*  That was the premise of the piece.
*  Cause it was like, finally, finally there's a show that's like for us to
*  finally, there's an unpredictable show that gets the conversation piece.
*  But I think when, when people talk about what's going to happen in this show,
*  you don't really hear a lot of dialogue about the history of how bad these shows
*  were and what like we grew up with in the seventies and the eighties and even like
*  the most famous show is Brett Musburger and Phyllis George and Jimmy the Greek.
*  Like go back and watch that watch that show on YouTube.
*  It is absolutely brutal television.
*  It's brutal, but it was great.
*  We loved it.
*  Uh, but you go through and like, you know, how many ESPN studio shows have there been?
*  How many countdowns has there been?
*  There's been like 20, how many different football shows have we had year after
*  year and even the Fox show with all those guys, that's kind of like a karaoke
*  show of the show that was pretty good 15 years ago and inside the NBA has been
*  able to just levitate above it.
*  And we've always been able to point to it and say, Oh, this is the one,
*  thank God for the show.
*  At least we have the show.
*  This is the show that's figured it out.
*  And I think Barclays what 85% of it, cause he's the best TV
*  talent we've ever had in sports.
*  So wherever he goes, when you talk to Brazil about the shiny new toy thing
*  and, um, is that worth it?
*  What's the price?
*  It is worth it.
*  If you're NBC, it is worth it.
*  If you're Amazon, because you have Barclay, you have this face you can
*  put everywhere you can trot out.
*  It is like buying the biggest, shiniest yacht in St.
*  Barthes.
*  And I think he's, I think he, I don't even know what he's going to get, but
*  it's going to be some nuts number, I think.
*  Cause you get the legacy of you're still basically getting the inside
*  of the NBA because of him, right?
*  Anyway, Brazil, any more on this?
*  No, I was kind of trying to find inside the NBA ratings and they're all over
*  the place because it's at the number right after the game is done.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Kurt, do you have something on that?
*  Well, I was just going to say to, to, to Ryan's point earlier about the looseness.
*  To me, the biggest thing, if it moves somewhere else is it's got to go into
*  the night, like that, that's a huge part of inside the NBA is that going to work
*  on ESPN when they have to get to something else after the game is not going to work
*  on NBC if they have to go to like Jimmy Fallon, we got to go, you know, local news.
*  So really like to me, they're tossing a charmed.
*  Yeah.
*  They would have to do it on Peacock, right?
*  It would be like coming up next on Peacock.
*  It's just different.
*  Once you're making viewers work for any piece of what they're watching.
*  I don't like that.
*  I don't want to flip.
*  That's why Amazon probably makes the most sense.
*  This is where the Barkley number, you can't put a cap on it because.
*  If there's one thing we've learned about content, the last, I don't
*  even think it's five years long.
*  I think it's like a three to four year thing where the decision makers are like,
*  are this person guarantees me an audience?
*  Done.
*  Like, I don't, whatever, whatever.
*  And I think that clearly Barkley is on that short list and it's not the play
*  by play because the play by play color numbers, very clear that ESPN was sick
*  of not being able to figure it out.
*  And then finding the like, we'll just fix it with money and grab arguably the
*  best team and then Fox finds a way to, I mean, you want to talk about like
*  salvaging things for a team that we're losing all of its free agents.
*  It's like, actually you just drafted two future hall of famers and Olson and
*  Burkhardt and then the Olson part of it.
*  That's really weird.
*  But Fox came out about as well as you could ever imagine post losing bucking
*  Aikman, but I'm talking like non.
*  Cause I I've never really quite understood, like people bitch about the wrong play
*  by play and color people, but I don't know that the ratings go up because you
*  have the right broadcast team.
*  I don't know that I would ever believe that.
*  No, the ratings are the same.
*  No matter who's in asking the fucking.
*  Yeah.
*  So we've been saying that forever.
*  It's just the fact.
*  Barkley is on a really, really short list of people that I think would get people
*  to go, well, what are they doing?
*  And if it's something new, that number's astronomical.
*  It's it's massive.
*  Right.
*  I make the case for Kenny Smith quickly.
*  No, I actually think he's become underrated and I think he's a big, I like
*  him and Barkley together, like if it was just Barkley moving on his own and saying
*  goodbye to everybody else and it's like, Barkley is going to be a new team.
*  I would really miss what he had with Kenny because I thought they
*  really compliment each other.
*  I thought they were getting a real arguments on the air that were good nature.
*  No, it was respectful.
*  I thought he brought a different level of thinking to it.
*  I just, that would make me the saddest Shaq.
*  I like Shaq personally.
*  I think the show would be fine with or without Shaq.
*  You'd probably miss some of the comedy, but the Barkley Kenny piece.
*  I don't know.
*  And maybe what would be weird is if Barkley went to one channel and
*  Kenny went to another one and Kenny and Shaq or it got split up.
*  I think that would be strange too, but it's, it, it does feel.
*  You're right about the Kenny part, like being the foil to Barkley.
*  I think Shaq from the beginning to where he's at now is a massive improvement.
*  It's like a borderline miracle.
*  Right.
*  He was so bad in my first year.
*  It was, it was, I was like, why are you guys doing this?
*  You already have what everybody considers the best show.
*  Like, why would you do this?
*  And I think it's worked because he and Chuck have a different dynamic.
*  That's totally different than the Kenny and Shaq dynamic.
*  So that's one of those rare cases where it worked out.
*  And like my issue with Draymond on it, what we talked about last week and then
*  kind of got picked up everywhere.
*  It's like, you can't trust me as a young guy that was insecure about being on the
*  air and I'm surrounded by all these other stars and all these other big names and
*  all the stuff that I was going through at the beginning of my career, I didn't
*  want to be made fun of.
*  I always wanted to be the cool guy.
*  And what you learn is you can't be the fucking cool guy.
*  Every single segment, you can't, you have to be a little vulnerable.
*  You have to make fun of yourself.
*  You have to be self-deprecating and Draymond doesn't have any of those beats yet.
*  He doesn't understand any of it.
*  He's also, I would argue, one of the more delusional people that we have commenting
*  on himself in sports today.
*  So it wasn't even fair.
*  Like he wasn't ready to even sit there, but then he had to learn how to like,
*  Hey man, you have to, you have to do like Chuck makes fun of himself all the time.
*  Shaq learned, Hey, I got to make fun of himself.
*  Kenny's going to be made fun of because he's Kenny Smith sit next to Shaq and
*  Charles Barkley.
*  And then Ernie has to be the rare anchor.
*  Like if you ever replaced Ernie, can you imagine how mad the new anchor would be
*  and be like, Hey, wait, you're just going to talk over me the whole time.
*  Blow up my clock.
*  Never.
*  I've got somebody in my ear and I've got a toss and now you're talking over me.
*  You have no respect for me.
*  Like professionally, that's part of the joke is they never have any respect for
*  Ernie doing all the mechanics of driving a show.
*  So to learn to do that on the fly immediately for a younger person in that
*  role, that person would lose their mind.
*  You're like, wait, this is what I have to do the whole time.
*  So I'd hate to see it broken up.
*  I just think the Barkley, Hey, we've got Barkley.
*  You roll them out to the upfronts.
*  You're playing at Augusta with them, with a couple of vice presidents and
*  programming that there's this other baked in vanity value, the word you used
*  earlier that happens with him.
*  That doesn't happen with many other people in the business.
*  No, it's, it's like a Letterman's going to CBS type of situation where you're
*  getting, you're getting the show, but you're also getting this personality that
*  now you get to put at the forefront of all these different things you're doing.
*  You could argue that maybe TNT slash HBO slash Warner didn't leverage that.
*  Quite enough.
*  The dream on things interesting though, Curtis, cause on the one hand, I didn't
*  think he was good on the, on the show for, I thought he was just too mean spirited.
*  And, um, I just thought his usage rate was higher than it needed to be considering
*  he was walking on the show.
*  That's the best sports studio show of all time, but he's a young announcer.
*  I'm sure he'd be better five years ago.
*  The bigger issue to me is they just didn't need a fifth person.
*  There was no reason to do it.
*  And that was the part, you know, when we talked, when anyone who was critical of
*  it, it more stemmed from why, which goes back to our initial conversation.
*  Why, why do you have to tinker with this?
*  So when I look at Amazon and NBC, as they put together their shows, I guess
*  their thoughts are going to be more as more, you know, Amazon did an NFL show.
*  They had five people on it.
*  Why do you have five people on it?
*  Why don't you have four and then rotate in a fifth person, depending on what
*  your specialty is, you know, but I just know how this works.
*  This is, we're just in the more and more, how many people are in the
*  NBC Sunday night show?
*  What was that?
*  Nine?
*  Let's go to Jack Collins worth and Rodney Harrison.
*  Wait, I don't know what the peak number that was like a cap violation.
*  There was a time where I think Dan and Obermann were on it.
*  Yeah.
*  They had two and cost us and cost us three on, I'm pretty sure at the same time.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, that would be an awesome piece is to go back and just try to figure out
*  how they actually split up the minutes with that.
*  I mean, maybe it's a terrible piece, so I'm not trying to give you an awful
*  assignment, but I remember at one point, cause Bill's always really good in this
*  when it was the women's final four.
*  It's like, Oh, we got a six man desk or six woman desk.
*  I guess that's what I should say.
*  So look out, you know, hide the kids.
*  NBC Sunday night football at its peak, push the limits that man has never
*  attempted to push since because it was just, what the fuck are we doing?
*  Yeah.
*  We're going to different sets.
*  We're going on the field.
*  We're back over here.
*  CBS, when they were trying to work JJ watt in there, but they didn't want to
*  get rid of Phil Sims, they were doing six at half times for, you know, like
*  the early game six is just incredible to me because there's always five
*  people who just are never talking.
*  Um, I don't, I don't know if we're ever going to figure this out ever.
*  Curtis, you've been writing about this ever since I've known you and it feels
*  like everyone's getting worse at it.
*  I had somebody from a network tell me one times we produce TV for ourselves
*  rather than producing TV for people at home.
*  And that that's like, that note has always stuck with me, you know, as a producer,
*  that sounds like a cool idea.
*  I remember the last, as long as we're doing random nineties references here, I
*  think it was the last year CBS had the NFL before they lost it.
*  It was just Greg Gumbel and Terry Bradshaw in the studio.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe Pat O'Brien and Leslie Visser were somewhere around, but it was kind of a
*  two man show and it was good.
*  It was fine.
*  It was, it was totally, it was cost us and Pat Riley was the years between
*  the coach, the one he coached the next.
*  It was one year and you can go back and watch some of those on YouTube.
*  And they're like, it's like legit good.
*  It's like, Whoa, almost like a podcast.
*  I do want to stay on this because I now I'm thinking in my head, the
*  Rolodex of things that I love, like baseball tonight, peak baseball
*  tonight in the nineties.
*  I'm like, that's the studio show.
*  That's the thing.
*  And it's like your college girlfriend is over.
*  She's like, do you want to have sex?
*  You're like, no, damage diamond notes are coming up next.
*  Like I, I can't do this, but then I also think about the NBC weekend NBA package.
*  And it's like, Oh wait, we're going to have Peter Vesey come out the side door
*  and just blow torch somebody right now.
*  Like this is awesome.
*  Like, wait, I can't go anywhere.
*  Peter Vesey is coming up and it's kind of like the old Vegas line where when my
*  friends complain about Vegas saying that place sucks now, it's like, no, you're
*  30 years older than the first time that you went there.
*  So you're different.
*  It's not that Vegas Vegas has some changes and surely it evolves, but
*  you're a lot different now than Vegas is.
*  So are we sitting here complaining about these shows that it's really about us
*  being a lot different where we were so easily appeased with this stuff.
*  I'm like, wait, ravage ravages.
*  Got the 10 inning game against the blue Jays.
*  Like I can't, I already watched the game.
*  I want to see the highlights again.
*  I want to see Rob Nen strike out the side.
*  Like maybe we just all change and studios keep trying to fix these shows in a way
*  that we don't care about anymore.
*  Um, I'm still laughing at the game.
*  It's a diamond notes thing.
*  That's fairly, really funny.
*  No, because you know, I loved it.
*  I don't, I don't know what I was putting off for diamond notes.
*  I don't even care.
*  Yeah.
*  But here's, here's the big point of all this.
*  And it goes, it connects inside the NBA, everything.
*  If you have four or five, six people in the studio show, you have to script things.
*  You can't have a real conversation anymore.
*  Everything becomes.
*  That was the case 12 years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  By the way, the more people on it, the more you script and then all of a sudden
*  it dies, it's not real conversation and it sucks.
*  That's what that, that is, that is the point.
*  Can I respond to the Brasila point?
*  So technically sometimes I think you're right where we value this stuff because
*  when we, when we cared the most, it was the way they did it.
*  So I'm always going to defend it.
*  I just think the studio shows were way more important than the 90s because
*  we had less sports, right?
*  We, we like some cities didn't even have 24 seven sports radio stations at that
*  point wouldn't have the internet yet.
*  We didn't have podcasts to listen to.
*  We, I just remember the eighties were even worse, but I remember just being so
*  starved for any sort of info or conversation about things I cared about in
*  sports that I would listen, drive around in the nineties, listen to EI and I
*  fucking hated EI.
*  I didn't like, I literally didn't like one of the shows and one of the hosts.
*  And that's what I would listen to driving around.
*  Cause it was like, Oh, at least they're talking about sports.
*  I have other people in my life.
*  So when I would watch like baseball tonight or like Riley with Costas, it
*  was really meaningful.
*  It was like, this is a half hour of sports that I'm just not getting enough of.
*  It goes back to like when we did the national is the first piece we did for
*  Grantland about the national trying to be this all sports newspaper, like how
*  meaningful that was to all of us.
*  Cause it was like, Holy shit.
*  Somebody is going to write about sports for 40 pages every day.
*  This is amazing.
*  Now it's like, you can get anything you want.
*  And I don't know where sports studio shows fit in there in the same way, which
*  is what was so special about the Barkley thing, because you still like the game
*  would end and you, I always wanted to hear what he thought afterwards.
*  And that's a really rare, that's the rarest thing you have.
*  First take has some of that now with Stephen A.
*  What do you, Oh, I can't wait to watch Stephen A the next morning.
*  It's seven a.m.
*  PT.
*  Hear what he said about the Cowboys.
*  Like the shows that have succeeded and thrived, I think have hit that the best.
*  It's like this happened.
*  What do you think?
*  Which we've tried to replicate with our pods too, I think.
*  We've already talked about though, the ESPN, like the ESPN show should be better.
*  It just should be better.
*  But Stephen A is going to do the Stephen A role.
*  Malika is a star, but she's the anchor.
*  So she's still going to figure out a way to defer.
*  Cause the job when you host is to defer and perk is feeling
*  and she's like, well look, the thing is you give up the swag and what do you do?
*  You give up the weed of 24 hours a night.
*  Like you take a CO2 polish and this is a flyer.
*  You give up the smoke of 4 hours a night.
*  And it's fun, but you're literally in the dark with pigeons out there.
*  Cause he just focuses on himself, but you never quite know.
*  Like if he were tweeting during the revolutionary war, it would depend
*  on the battle and be like, Hey, this is a home game.
*  Those boys got pride and then.
*  And then.
*  Can this be a segment per
*  phrase that we just.
*  Random revolutionary wars.
*  Right, and then the French would get involved
*  and be like best, George and the Americans
*  want the trade deadline, like they added
*  the French Navy, so ain't no way.
*  So it just, there's, that show just,
*  it's, I know it's not for me,
*  and we've said this numerous times.
*  So I'm arguing my own point of our standards
*  in the 90s versus our standards today,
*  and I agree with you, Bill, we just cared
*  about it then because we didn't have
*  that much content to get through.
*  I never know what that show is every year,
*  but they're also not allowed to have even close
*  to the amount of real estate that TNT has.
*  So it's not even, sometimes I don't even feel
*  it's fair to be, when they come back from half time,
*  you can get mad about what it is at half time,
*  but you just go, what's the, you can't get mad about this.
*  The best way I would describe it is the way that,
*  how short the segments are would be like
*  if they were being asked to play basketball
*  about a three point line and TNT got a three point line.
*  And shoes.
*  That's the difference.
*  Mike and Mike had experimented with a side little deal
*  where it was a couple chairs for like a longer form interview.
*  That was weird, but the chair angle was brutal
*  because it just led to an absolute dick bulge in chinos
*  that was just right, right in your face.
*  Yeah.
*  It was nothing, it was like performance
*  and hand and camera shot, and I remember the first time
*  I filled in in the side set and I like sat into it.
*  I was like, whoa dude, like what are,
*  you need to put up a parental warning on this?
*  And some guys like, he's got his headset on,
*  he's like, we got bad chairs, man, we got bad chairs,
*  we're trying to work through it.
*  Chairs are really important.
*  The dick bulge set. Especially.
*  Did they get rid of the dick bulge set?
*  Yeah, because there was no desk.
*  You were just out there in the open and the angle
*  and the cinching of the pants and the entire thing.
*  But you know, sex sells.
*  Curtis, anything else?
*  I was getting unnerved when I see a sportscaster
*  without a desk. I really do.
*  Yeah, I don't like sportscasting.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't like it for talk shows or anything.
*  Like anytime it's just like the legs, it just feels,
*  I don't know, I feel uneasy.
*  It just feels like a producer said, now let's stand up.
*  Okay, thanks.
*  That's so helpful.
*  All right, do we wrap it up?
*  I think we got it.
*  Yeah.
*  All right, Curtis, what do you got to plug?
*  Press box Monday, David Shoemaker,
*  and then I don't want to go all Pat Bev on you guys,
*  but please subscribe to my podcast,
*  because Wednesday, if we pull it off,
*  we're going to have a really cool NBA-related podcast.
*  It's going to be really, really fun.
*  I just want to make sure it gets recorded
*  and done and everything.
*  There you go.
*  What's your finals prediction?
*  Mavs and four.
*  Okay.
*  I love it.
*  So you do your finals prediction,
*  on your Tuesday pod?
*  Yeah, or Celtson seven.
*  Oh, you already did it.
*  I'm still sorting mine out.
*  I want to know more KP info.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  Is this fan duel have any sort of line
*  on what I think you're going to pick?
*  I'd probably pick Celtson six right now,
*  but can I see footage of Porzikis practicing?
*  Would be great.
*  Couple threes, maybe him running up and down the court.
*  Would be nice.
*  I think it's going to be a good one.
*  If you're interested in what I'm thinking about,
*  please go ahead and check out my podcast.
