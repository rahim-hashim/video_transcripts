# Do The Celtics Have To Trade Jaylen Brown? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvO5DDPeotU)
*  I can't believe I'm doing this.
*  I was like the last person on Never Break Up,
*  Tate and Brown Corner.
*  And I still don't think they should.
*  You're in a better mood.
*  You're in a better mood than I thought you'd be.
*  No, because I knew after game two, I knew it was over.
*  The Celtics were almost five point favorites today,
*  which I didn't understand.
*  I don't know what people were seeing with this series.
*  Miami was smarter, they were tougher,
*  and they had the best part of the series.
*  What else did we did?
*  Yeah, I mean, look, it was minus,
*  what was it, minus 10 in game two?
*  Yeah, there was minus nine in game one,
*  minus 10 in game two, and Boston was minus five,
*  or got minus four and a half, minus five.
*  It was in that range for game three.
*  If they do decide to do a tweak,
*  isn't Portland the logical destination, right?
*  Portland's a team that, they're on a timetable with Dame.
*  They got the number three pick in the draft.
*  They seem a little bit desperate for a variety of reasons.
*  It's either trade Dame or keep Dame and try to make a run.
*  They've been open about saying we wanna get a wing,
*  and it just seems like that's kind of a fit
*  if they wanted to make a move, the Celtics.
*  Over, you keep these two together,
*  and now you're 100 plus million a year
*  for the next few years with two guys.
*  So what's the deal?
*  Let's say it's number three, and it's Simons,
*  and it's a future first, and it's a swap, something like that.
*  Or maybe it's just the number three in Simons.
*  I don't even know what Brown's value is,
*  but you have the number three and you have Simons in it,
*  and maybe more, because as we've seen with these trades
*  that we've had lately, I don't know what the values are,
*  but Jaylen Brown is the second team OMBA guy, he's 26.
*  So not getting Lillard.
*  You're trying to pick off Simons in the number three pick.
*  Wow.
*  Mowin' this one over.
*  No, because Jaylen's worth,
*  I think Jaylen's worth more than Lillard, straight up.
*  Well, Lillard's gonna be 33 years old next year,
*  and I don't know where that takes you.
*  In the contract.
*  So I guess the question for me is that number three,
*  I hate to do the two-eras thing
*  because the wearers have kind of ruined that,
*  but with the team that they have, could they use that asset?
*  Could they spin it forward where they're still really good,
*  but they have some can't-miss guy?
*  Is Scoot, in your opinion, let's say Scoot's at number three.
*  Let's say Charlotte says fuck it
*  and takes Brandon Miller at two.
*  Scoot's there at three.
*  Portland doesn't wanna take Scoot.
*  What do they want another guard for?
*  Is Scoot that good?
*  Is Scoot a potential first-team OMBA guy, in your opinion?
*  He wasn't as good this year as he was the previous year.
*  Last year when I'd watch Dyson Daniels and Hardy
*  and Beauchamp, I'd constantly be like,
*  dude, look at Scoot.
*  One of my favorite Scoot games
*  is where he played against Wemba Nyama,
*  and he was like, I know what the marquee is.
*  I know what everybody's here to watch,
*  and I'm going right at this motherfucker.
*  But then he didn't play as well this year,
*  so I don't know if he was coasting.
*  I don't know if he's-
*  Yeah, it seemed like he was in self-maintenance mode
*  a little bit.
*  Yeah, I also think he's way more of a...
*  He's probably more likely to go the scoring guard route
*  than the traditional point guard combo thing,
*  which we've already talked about,
*  which isn't exactly all that rare.
*  I probably wouldn't do that.
*  I wouldn't.
*  I've talked it out and thought about it.
*  I know how bad it is tonight.
*  I know how bad Boston's talk shows are gonna be tomorrow.
*  I know, unless you're telling me something else
*  that I don't know that it's irreparable after this series,
*  I would go, all we're doing is trying to build rosters
*  that have a chance, and as bad as this series went,
*  Boston's still gonna have a chance next year,
*  so I wouldn't be in a hurry to do that.
*  Simon's is really talented.
*  I like him.
*  Small guards in the playoffs, I don't know.
*  I mean, unless I was convinced of Scoot.
*  Or Simon's is in, Simon's you spin for something else.
*  I'm with you.
*  I would rather keep this together and not overreact.
*  Here's my one caveat for you.
*  I think there's some scarring and some damage
*  from the last 12 months with Brown, with the team.
*  And going back to the KD rumors,
*  I think that is unquestionably true,
*  and my fear is you give him the big contract
*  and he's still mad about all the stuff from last summer,
*  and maybe you can proactively get ahead of it
*  by trading him for 130 cents on the dollar,
*  which I think Portland would do.
*  So that would be the counter for it.
*  My instinct would be to keep it,
*  but my other instinct is he's gonna get mad.
*  He'll feel like he got blamed.
*  Why isn't Tatum in trade rumors and all that,
*  and that's just where his head's gonna go.
*  Does he wanna be the guy on another team?
*  I still feel like he can get better.
*  I know he made second team all-in-one.
*  I had him third, third team.
*  I thought he was the sixth best forward in the league.
*  There were also a bunch of forwards
*  that didn't play enough games to qualify.
*  I still think he's too sloppy with the ball,
*  just period, he's too sloppy.
*  He makes too many dumb turnovers,
*  and I still think there's another level
*  for him to get to as a player.
*  The thing that is really, really, really disturbing to me,
*  and it makes me wonder if as an asset,
*  his value is higher than the actual player,
*  what happened to him on defense?
*  Like what happened?
*  Yeah, it's a great question.
*  Like remember when you thought, oh wow.
*  I thought he was an absolute elite defender,
*  and he's not.
*  He's not an elite defender at all.
*  I don't know, who's he shutting down these days?
*  Like to be with somebody that chucks a lot of shots,
*  and he's, I gotta say, like a mediocre defender this year.
*  He really was.
*  Yeah, it's really surprising,
*  because at one point you felt like his profile
*  was gonna be everything you want in a player,
*  and he's still, even with this handle,
*  which again, it's not the hand this year,
*  when he fell down, he actually was reaching
*  for his left elbow, I thought, on that whole thing anyway,
*  when he fell down.
*  Because I know you were talking about the dunk
*  at the end of the previous game,
*  that's the last series against Philadelphia.
*  Seventh game, yeah.
*  Right, but then I thought when he fell down
*  in this series, he was grabbing his elbow.
*  And look, dude, he couldn't,
*  if you watch any of that Miami stuff from last year,
*  I remember going, oh my god, they know.
*  They, like, PJ Tucker going at him.
*  Right, going like, oh, hey, once he puts it on the ground,
*  go for it, because he's not really more
*  than a two dribble guy.
*  But the defense is concerning,
*  because I thought that he was the dude
*  that you wanted to avoid, and now I'll see teams
*  switch off of Tatum to go into Brown.
