# The NBA's Big Picture Shift, Haliburton What-Ifs + A 2020 Redraft | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM)
*  Alright, we were recording this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=0.0s)]
*  It is a little past 11 in the morning Pacific time on Sunday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=27.86s)]
*  We are not doing this after Pacers Knicks because it's Memorial Day weekend and sometimes [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=31.54s)]
*  real life takes over the podcast schedule. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=37.22s)]
*  I don't know what to say, but Ryan Rosillo is here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=39.18s)]
*  We have a bunch of fun stuff we're going to talk to. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=41.06s)]
*  We're going to be able to talk about these playoffs even not knowing what's happening [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=42.82s)]
*  in game three tonight, which started out pretty shocking with the Pacers taking a 2-0 lead. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=46.14s)]
*  I'm going to start here, Rosillo. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=50.82s)]
*  Indiana and OKC, if that ends up being our finals. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=54.26s)]
*  What's interesting, big picture is you could argue each of those teams is the team you [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=59.14s)]
*  would want to be for the next four to five years in their conferences. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=63.58s)]
*  And I think the OKC is a pretty easy argument for the West unless you want to throw San [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=66.58s)]
*  Antonio at me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=71.9s)]
*  But for Indiana, the fact that we are now, I don't know, two plus games in the conference [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=72.9s)]
*  The thought of them being the team you would most envy in the East was like 50 to one odds, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=80.94s)]
*  I would say, in January. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  How did we get here? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=87.22s)]
*  Look, the Thunder thing, you're right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=89.26s)]
*  Whether it's roster or the flexibility of what all these future draft picks are going [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=93.28s)]
*  to be and, you know, look in the future draft pick stuff, sometimes it's like, oh, that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=96.26s)]
*  didn't work out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  And then there's like a pick in 2029 and you go, oh, my God, I can't believe that ended [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  up happening. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  You're going to have to sell me a little harder on the Pacers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=108.9s)]
*  Like this is a really nice run. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=111.02s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=112.06s)]
*  They're up 2-0. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=113.06s)]
*  There's tons of great things I want to say about the Pacers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=114.06s)]
*  But to map out the next five years of them being the franchise you want to be, you got [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=115.78s)]
*  to sell me on that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=119.42s)]
*  Well, so let's go this way first. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=120.7s)]
*  Who would you rather be in the East? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=123.72s)]
*  Give me a team. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=127.34s)]
*  Because I felt the same way as you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=129.18s)]
*  I was like, oh, there's got to be somebody. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=130.58s)]
*  And then I'm going through the conference and I'm like, to trade? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=132.54s)]
*  Orlando? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=136.5s)]
*  Boston? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=137.98s)]
*  No idea what their payroll is going to look like in two years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=138.98s)]
*  Philly? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=141.42s)]
*  I got to deal with Embiid and Paul George. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=142.42s)]
*  New York? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=145.74s)]
*  This might be where we peak with them right now with these five guys that the first two [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=147.3s)]
*  games that they played, the plus minus was an abomination. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=152.34s)]
*  And I don't know how that plays out over the next two years. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=155.6s)]
*  Milwaukee, I think you throw in there as a like, do you want to pick them? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=158.34s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=163.5s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=164.5s)]
*  Who else? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=165.5s)]
*  Who else is there? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=166.5s)]
*  I thought about it because for all of those reasons, but this almost feels like can I [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=168.1s)]
*  take the field? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=173.54s)]
*  Which isn't fair and it isn't the right answer. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=175.62s)]
*  But as great as this Pacers thing is, and we were texting this morning about it, I brought [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=177.86s)]
*  up in the pod this week, like this is really great, but it's also usually not the way it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=181.54s)]
*  works. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=186.78s)]
*  And as much fun as it is in the depth and Halliburton kind of reminding people like [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=188.1s)]
*  what he can be. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=192.82s)]
*  It's just hard for me to be like, yeah, I want to be the team that doesn't have a top [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  10 player in the NBA. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=199.82s)]
*  Like give me that for the next five years. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=200.82s)]
*  I guess my question is, did he move into at least the top 15? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=203.26s)]
*  He did make all NBA. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=207.9s)]
*  Now there were some guys that were injured, so that's not necessarily a great litmus test, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=208.9s)]
*  but he's somewhere in the top 20 to 22, I would say. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  And then the fact that he's found a way to raise his game in the playoffs, I think that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=218.1s)]
*  counts for something. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=223.5s)]
*  The fact that he's so unique with where basketball has gone, where we just don't have guards [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=224.82s)]
*  who run the show like this in the same way anymore. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=230.78s)]
*  We have these guards that are trying to get their stuff off and you got to involve the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=232.92s)]
*  offense around them and what they do. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=237.78s)]
*  He just kind of is additive. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=239.42s)]
*  It makes everybody better. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=240.78s)]
*  I know you've studied at least the top five in this draft and everybody likes Harper and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=243.42s)]
*  it seems like the Spurs are going to take Harper. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  All the indications are like that that pick is really not available and they're going [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=251.77999999999997s)]
*  to take Harper and they feel good about it and that's where we're going. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=255.17999999999998s)]
*  But I don't think he's an inclusive player like Halburn. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=259.58s)]
*  He's more of the way guards have gone this decade where they score. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  They can also bring the ball up. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=268.06s)]
*  They can set people up. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=269.34s)]
*  They can run a fast break, but they're not constantly just thinking about involving everybody else. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=271.26s)]
*  Harper definitely wants to get his points. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=276.26s)]
*  I'm not really ready for it, but if we were doing a draft conversation, the craziest thing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=278.26s)]
*  about some of these picks is you go, all right, even if you love Harper and you should draft [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=284.38s)]
*  based on talent, you shouldn't be drafting on fit, especially when you don't really know [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  who you are. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  But you're like, how do you play Harper off of De'Aaron Fox? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  If you think like San Antonio with a healthy Wemba Nyama is going to be a real player in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=299.98s)]
*  the West. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=303.86s)]
*  Then you think about Ace Bailey standing around watching his other guys and look, he got used [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=304.86s)]
*  to standing around because he watched Harper and played with him. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=313.3s)]
*  That in itself is a really interesting conversation because they're not used to having these teams [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  pick that, at least with Philly, we know they're established and what they want to be. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=320.22s)]
*  Then San Antonio, the assumption that we know who their three guys are. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=325.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of those questions where as soon as you sent it to me, I was like, what [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=330.1s)]
*  is he doing? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=335.18s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=336.18s)]
*  But when you run through all the known versus unknown, if the pace is your answer, you're [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=338.5s)]
*  like, okay, that's the known. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=343.9s)]
*  But there's also the Turner part of it that you're always bringing up in that this group [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=345.08s)]
*  does not pay the luxury tax. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=349.14s)]
*  And Turner is going to be whatever you think of him, especially in this free agent class, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=351.14s)]
*  despite the irony of feeling like he'd been available in the trade market for years. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  He provides something to them and 20 million a year in this new NBA world is probably not [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=363.14s)]
*  going to cut it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=369.82s)]
*  But that's like a minor issue compared to some of the other, obviously, like when you [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=371.34s)]
*  look at the Celtics with all this stuff. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=374.34s)]
*  I guess I still would rather. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=375.9s)]
*  Would you rather be the Celtics? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=377.58s)]
*  That sounds like you would. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=379.82s)]
*  I think I would. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=382.26s)]
*  But that's going to get weird quick. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=385.74s)]
*  We know Tatum's gone next year. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=387.46s)]
*  Drew's going to be 35, 36. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=390.21999999999997s)]
*  Tatum's not playing next year. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=393.58s)]
*  Jalen's going to be at 60 million. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  This Indiana, the way they set it up, Tyrese and Siakam next year are 91 million combined, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=401.26s)]
*  which is pretty great. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  Normally, if you're paying two guys who are in the top, Siakam's always one of the best [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  nine to 10 forwards. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=415.86s)]
*  He's never one of the best five or six, but he's always in the top 50 for players. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=417.46s)]
*  So you put those two together. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=422.82s)]
*  He's probably even higher than that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=423.82s)]
*  I know I had a huge Siakam game one thing where I'm like, he has to initiate more and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=425.7s)]
*  then he comes out and almost drops 40 on him in game two. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=431.26s)]
*  So he was terrific. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=433.74s)]
*  He was great. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=434.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=435.74s)]
*  I feel like he's, what, in the top 30? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=436.74s)]
*  Well, usually the market, wherever you want to put him, if you're paying those two guys, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  normally with the way the current NBA structure is, that's 115 to 120 million combined for [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=444.41999999999996s)]
*  those two spots. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=450.09999999999997s)]
*  So they're getting a discount on those two spots. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=451.09999999999997s)]
*  Then they smartly signed Nemhar to 18, 19, 21 as an extension, which is right around [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  where his value is. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=459.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't know where the cap's gone. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=460.65999999999997s)]
*  Niece Smith's at 11 and 11 the next two years. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=462.02s)]
*  McConnell's at 10 and 11. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=464.46s)]
*  Toppin's at 14 next year. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=466.29999999999995s)]
*  Matheran's at nine. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=467.85999999999996s)]
*  And they still have Walker at 6.6 and Shepard at 2.7. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=469.5s)]
*  They have all their own picks except for 26 and have the ability to, I don't know, either [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=473.46s)]
*  package dudes together. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=480.58s)]
*  They have the ability to dump somebody. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=481.58s)]
*  You know, like if they wanted to trade Matheran this summer, they'll be able to at nine. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=483.73999999999995s)]
*  They wanted to either upgrade him or try to get a vet or do whatever. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=487.14s)]
*  So I think the flexibility is what's appealing, but you made the key point. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=491.34s)]
*  They don't pay the luxury tax. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  I think the owner's like 90. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=495.34s)]
*  And in general, they've just, um, you know, they're like a few of these teams just don't [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=498.86s)]
*  do it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=502.98s)]
*  OKC is another one that we're going to find out how much they want to keep this team together [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=503.98s)]
*  when these guys start getting expensive. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=508.78000000000003s)]
*  But at least with Indianapolis, I know what I have with my top two for the next three [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=510.7s)]
*  years. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=514.78s)]
*  I can add around it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=515.78s)]
*  I might have guys coming in who want to play with this nucleus and I'm in a much weaker [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=516.86s)]
*  conference, which I think is the other appealing thing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=521.26s)]
*  I'm in like the JV conference. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, that's another part of this exercise. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=526.34s)]
*  You go through it, you're like, man, flag ends up in the West. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=527.9s)]
*  You know, if Harper's a stud, he ends up in the West. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=530.66s)]
*  When Benyama just a couple of years ago, right? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=532.82s)]
*  You know, maybe on us and then Atlanta's like, we'll take research, you know, who I actually [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=535.62s)]
*  do like and thought he showed a lot of promise as a rookie here. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=540.42s)]
*  But when you were thinking about the lottery going like, hey, can the East at least get [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=543.34s)]
*  flag, just try like if he's going to be this special. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=547.58s)]
*  And, you know, we've had this happen before where it felt like there was this massive [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=551.02s)]
*  migration, which really mirrors history, Bill, where you just kept pushing things further [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=554.1s)]
*  and further out West. But look, I'm going to say something that's going to seem really [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=559.14s)]
*  stupid when they're up to and they just eliminated the Cavs. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=563.22s)]
*  But I'd rather be the Cavs because their three guys are better than the Pacers three [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  guys. And I know it didn't happen in the playoffs. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=571.9s)]
*  I could point to the injury stuff. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=574.7s)]
*  But, you know, there was some games in there, too, where it's like, what's wrong with you [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=576.14s)]
*  guys? I think Orlando is in this conversation because I think Palo is going to be better [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=579.4200000000001s)]
*  than anybody on the Pacers. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=582.94s)]
*  I looked at them as well. The problem is they're already paying their top two. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=584.94s)]
*  They're getting no advantage out of the young guys anymore. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=588.86s)]
*  They've already paid the top two plus sucks. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=591.1800000000001s)]
*  So they're kind of all in with the team they have. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=594.82s)]
*  And it's hard to move around the margins for them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=597.3800000000001s)]
*  But there's definitely a case for them. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=599.9000000000001s)]
*  You know, this this feels like one of those exercises where day of like any other [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=602.4200000000001s)]
*  answer seems like I just named the team they got rid of in five games. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=608.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that seems on its surface like I don't feel good about anyone in the East. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=612.02s)]
*  That was why I thought this was so interesting to talk about. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=616.3s)]
*  It's so it seems so improbable to me that Indiana would be the team you would land on. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=618.9s)]
*  But it probably is the most stable with the most flexibility of all these teams. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=622.86s)]
*  Even Orlando, we talked about like. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't know how you make that team better. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=631.62s)]
*  Your nucleus is what it is unless you you either trade France or Palo and they're not [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=633.26s)]
*  trading Palo. But that's going to be kind of their team. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=637.82s)]
*  And the thing that they need is for black to hit. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=640.9s)]
*  Right. Well, it sucks. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=644.3399999999999s)]
*  Sucks being healthy. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=645.3399999999999s)]
*  And honestly, like at some point you're going, should I give this guy an MVP vote? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=646.38s)]
*  It's like like they're just not going to be able to play offense now anymore. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=651.06s)]
*  And I think they got some look, I don't think they were the best offensive team. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=657.1s)]
*  This has been two years of this. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=660.38s)]
*  But they I think got some really bad habits offensively here with this whole thing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=661.66s)]
*  I'm more open to it than when you first suggested. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=667.14s)]
*  I think another thing in the Pacers favor, if you were going to go ahead and pick them [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=669.38s)]
*  and it just still feels like if you're picking the Pacers, you're kind of going like, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=674.54s)]
*  all right, I guess it's a recent. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=677.66s)]
*  But they did make conference finals two years in a row. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=679.78s)]
*  That's not nothing. That's exactly it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=681.86s)]
*  Is that this is now year two. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=684.06s)]
*  This is in Atlanta getting to the Eastern Conference finals. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=685.82s)]
*  This isn't Dame and that Portland team. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=689.02s)]
*  You know, whereas Dallas, when they got there with Luca and 22, you were like, is this [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=691.06s)]
*  real? And then it's, you know, they're in the finals two years later and here the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=695.58s)]
*  Pacers back to back years just, you know, getting through the East in a way [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=698.94s)]
*  where you were like, I don't know that I've ever thought about you this way [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=704.22s)]
*  during the regular season. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=709.82s)]
*  Like if they were really this good, you know, why were they not up there [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=710.98s)]
*  competing for for 60 wins with some of these other teams? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=716.6600000000001s)]
*  So the counter to that was the last two thirds of this season. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=721.0600000000001s)]
*  They were on that pace. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=723.94s)]
*  They started out bad for a bunch of reasons. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=725.0600000000001s)]
*  But last two thirds of the season, that's why we kept talking about them. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=728.14s)]
*  We're like, this is if you go by last 50 games, last 55, whatever it was, like [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=730.6999999999999s)]
*  they're, they're playing at the same level as all these other teams and the odds. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=735.8199999999999s)]
*  I remember we're talking, they were 28 to one in the East. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=739.9s)]
*  Now odds didn't really reflect what the last 50 games of the season were, which [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=743.5799999999999s)]
*  kind of happened last year with, uh, with Dallas too. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=747.54s)]
*  I think Cleveland I had on my list. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=750.62s)]
*  Boston's a really interesting one because first of all, it depends on what they're [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=753.4200000000001s)]
*  going to be able to do this summer. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=758.86s)]
*  And I think they have to get under that second apron because of the repeater [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=760.58s)]
*  tax and all the money it saves. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=764.1400000000001s)]
*  It just sets them up for the two years after that, but what they have to give [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=765.94s)]
*  up to be able to do that and then when do we get Tatum, you know, I did, and I've [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=768.82s)]
*  heard a variety of things about that, especially like how fast he got the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=774.38s)]
*  surgery and there's stuff going around that he might be able to come back in [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=778.0200000000001s)]
*  February, March because he got the surgery so fast, but who knows that [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=781.42s)]
*  Achilles things seems like it's seems like it could go as long as a year and a [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=784.38s)]
*  half. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=788.78s)]
*  And if you're following the Durant model, who's the most successful example of [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=789.42s)]
*  coming back, the rant was a year and a half. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=792.9399999999999s)]
*  So if you're just doing that and you're like, look, next year's a wipeout, the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=796.42s)]
*  wipeout next year, get under the apron. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=801.9799999999999s)]
*  And then they just try to reset around Tatum and Brown and, uh, Derek white. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=803.5799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, they then they're still in good shape with this conversation too. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=809.58s)]
*  I think your instincts on Cleveland, cause there's some fixes for them. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=813.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=819.54s)]
*  And you could talk yourself into Garland. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=820.18s)]
*  Um, he was hurt. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=823.34s)]
*  He was such a huge part of what they did. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=825.7s)]
*  Indiana caught them by surprise, bad style for them. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=827.54s)]
*  Uh, they lost one of the flukiest games in the history of the playoffs, except [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=831.3s)]
*  for the other two fluky games that Indiana would, you know, they, you could [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=834.62s)]
*  talk yourself into, wow, that was stupid. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=838.26s)]
*  Let's not overreact, which I think should be the answer for them. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=839.98s)]
*  Um, but at the same time, I still feel like they're going to make a move this [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=843.54s)]
*  summer. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=849.9s)]
*  Don't you? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=850.18s)]
*  I don't feel like Cleveland runs it back. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=851.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=854.38s)]
*  Always. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=854.9399999999999s)]
*  I always feel like everybody just runs it back. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=855.26s)]
*  Um, really? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=857.78s)]
*  Man, I feel like everybody gets, I feel like everybody always makes a [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=859.78s)]
*  move when the playoffs don't do. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=864.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=866.7s)]
*  Even the Celtics think about the last couple of years, like they, they made a [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=866.9s)]
*  move after every year starting, um, 22, 23, 20, they, they always did something. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=872.02s)]
*  They were really doing it because they weren't giving up anything though. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=878.54s)]
*  They gave up a first round pick and the Derek white deal. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=882.18s)]
*  They gave up Brogdon and Robert Williams in the Drew deal. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=884.9399999999999s)]
*  They gave up smart smart. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=891.34s)]
*  So smart was a big trade. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=892.98s)]
*  That was a pretty polarizing trade at the time. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=894.42s)]
*  People were surprised. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=896.38s)]
*  Now it seems like a no brainer. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=897.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=898.66s)]
*  I think fans in the media were like, I think the market smart stuff was, was [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=899.1s)]
*  pretty predictable. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=906.14s)]
*  Um, even though the fans in the media kind of was like, I can't believe, you [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=907.3s)]
*  know, they'd be getting rid of this guy. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=910.06s)]
*  So we're not talking about Jared Allen for Cleveland would be the one that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=911.3s)]
*  wouldn't shock me. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=915.3s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=916.46s)]
*  But like Jared Allen still is a better player than any of the guys that we've [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=917.06s)]
*  named that Boston has shipped out here. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=920.18s)]
*  And then if you start taking it to like the Garland level, that's a whole [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=921.94s)]
*  different thing. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=924.98s)]
*  I mean, if you're getting drew holiday for the package, the Celtics are just [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=925.94s)]
*  like, that's a no brainer. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=928.78s)]
*  The only thing with Persingas was talent wise and how it allowed them to be [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=930.34s)]
*  different made a lot of sense. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=933.82s)]
*  But you knew that for him to opt in to do the trade and then to give them the [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=934.94s)]
*  extension or like that dude gets hurt a lot and he's missed 65 games with the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=937.98s)]
*  Celtics and you know, do they win last year without him? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=941.42s)]
*  Probably. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=944.62s)]
*  Uh, I know he's had some nice moments. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=945.3s)]
*  And then of course you have this, the end of this year where, you know, watching [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=947.18s)]
*  this Pacers Knicks thing, you're just going like Persingas killed. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=950.9s)]
*  I mean, there's a bunch of things went wrong for the Celtics and I don't want [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=953.62s)]
*  to recap that series again with you, but you're just like having, you know, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=955.7s)]
*  here's the Pacers trying to survive with Turner and then Tony Bradley's playing [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=960.5s)]
*  now because Thomas Bryant is just not a solution. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=964.5s)]
*  And then they had the hand thing and that's like, man, Tony Bradley's out [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=968.62s)]
*  there running around for a few minutes and you're up, you're up in this series. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=972.3000000000001s)]
*  Um, a Knicks team that just destroyed Boston around the paint. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=976.34s)]
*  And just was the more physical and just the bigger basketball [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=980.62s)]
*  team throughout all this. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=983.5s)]
*  It feels like an answer. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=984.38s)]
*  Like I'm not, I'm not sitting here saying like you're crazy because the more you [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=986.9s)]
*  think about it, the less crazy it is. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=990.8199999999999s)]
*  I would push back on like, if you go from January 1st to February 1st, the Pacers [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=992.9799999999999s)]
*  are playing at the same level as other top teams, net rating wise, it, it isn't [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=996.9399999999999s)]
*  like those other teams were, were just far superior statistical profile teams [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1001.8599999999999s)]
*  than what the Pacers were, but it does feel like [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1005.8599999999999s)]
*  far superior because they were in the top five or six for the last 50 plus games. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1010.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1016.2199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I've got it up in front of me now. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1016.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1018.02s)]
*  C was plus. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1018.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1018.9399999999999s)]
*  C Boston, Cleveland, Cleveland was plus eight Clippers are plus seven. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1019.0999999999999s)]
*  Indiana was like plus five and a half. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1023.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1025.82s)]
*  Great. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1026.3799999999999s)]
*  Cool. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1026.62s)]
*  Plus five and a half 34 and 14 in the last 48. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1026.8999999999999s)]
*  I think you undersold Marcus smart a little just because how we felt about the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1029.98s)]
*  trade versus I think what his actual value is, I think people really thought he [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1033.86s)]
*  had value and they traded him. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1037.4199999999998s)]
*  That's why they got two first round picks for him. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1038.94s)]
*  You know, they got two first round picks plus poor Zingas for Marcus smart. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1041.22s)]
*  So he had to have real value. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1045.9s)]
*  And I think Jared Allen will have real value of Cleveland decides. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1048.18s)]
*  Actually, our move might be, let's do it then. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1051.78s)]
*  I mean, do you think open market like Marcus smart a couple of years, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1054.18s)]
*  Jared Allen right now it's the same demand. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1057.46s)]
*  Poor Zingas, the equivalent of poor Zingas and two first for Jared Allen. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1061.42s)]
*  I mean, the best thing with him is he's, I think he's 20 and 20 and then he goes [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1066.42s)]
*  up to 30, 30, 30. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1070.18s)]
*  So it's a five year commitment to, um, and there's a lot of teams that need a center. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1071.5s)]
*  I think Gafford is going to be in demand too. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1076.6200000000001s)]
*  I think both of those guys, if Dallas tried to, uh, trade Gafford, I think he's [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1078.66s)]
*  going to have real value because we just see it every year at these teams, like [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1082.78s)]
*  the Lakers that killed them that they had to play, couldn't play Jackson Hays, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1086.94s)]
*  you know, going down the line, like Milwaukee couldn't find any center to play. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1091.1000000000001s)]
*  Cause Lopez finally got old. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1095.54s)]
*  Um, yeah, I think, let me ask it, let me have Allen circled as a guy that I [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1097.9s)]
*  think could move this summer. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1102.9s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1104.6200000000001s)]
*  The Allen part of it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1105.18s)]
*  I guess I was thinking of some of the more aggressive stuff that we've [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1106.02s)]
*  tossed around with Cleveland, but yeah, no, I just think the default is. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1108.18s)]
*  And we've already done this, but the Cavs going, Hey, look, we didn't have [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1113.58s)]
*  mobile game too, you know, whatever. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1119.94s)]
*  Like that's, that's usually, I think what teams do, like if you talk to teams [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1121.8600000000001s)]
*  and be like, Hey, what went wrong? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1125.1s)]
*  And they'll paint the picture of like the things that wouldn't be [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1127.3s)]
*  repeated the next time around. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1130.26s)]
*  The problem is you have the Mitchell history and never getting out of the second round. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1131.58s)]
*  Like I thought they'd figured some stuff out where I, you know, other [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1135.6599999999999s)]
*  playoff years I'd look at them after the series is over and go to, they have [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1138.34s)]
*  like just real fundamental problems. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1141.2199999999998s)]
*  And I don't know that I feel that same way about him, even if history tells you [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1143.6999999999998s)]
*  that the exact same team, but I, again, they were just so good in the regular [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1146.86s)]
*  season, I don't know that I'd be in a hurry to be taken. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1150.2199999999998s)]
*  Like, it's one thing if there's a trade that presents itself where you feel like, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1153.22s)]
*  Hey, talent wise, we're at the same level and maybe we're a little more [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1155.6200000000001s)]
*  malleable in the playoffs. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1158.5400000000002s)]
*  Um, and maybe it just allows Mowgli to turn into this whole deal. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1160.22s)]
*  But then I think he almost would need a center again, um, instead of just [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1163.7s)]
*  running Mowgli out there for like 36 minutes a night playing center, especially [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1167.3400000000001s)]
*  with how big the league is and how, you know, these teams are going back to [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1170.42s)]
*  playing a real center and a power forward. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1173.5800000000002s)]
*  The thing that I would get back to like 20 minutes later here is to just, is [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1175.6200000000001s)]
*  this the kind of answer where a year or two years from now, you're like, holy [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1180.22s)]
*  shit, like we even asked that question because it does feel a little like that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1183.26s)]
*  Well, remember after you could have gone after every single year we've had for [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1187.78s)]
*  the last five or six and there was two teams we felt awesome about, and then [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1192.14s)]
*  that was kind of the peak for us feeling awesome about them. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1197.26s)]
*  I would say Dallas last year was a good example. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1200.14s)]
*  Yeah, but Dallas looks really sad. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1202.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1206.22s)]
*  And by the way, like if anybody, everybody had been healthy, like in a [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1206.46s)]
*  full year with all those guys and like, I thought they were going to be a really [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1209.06s)]
*  good team in the West again this year, if they were ready to go in the playoffs. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1212.26s)]
*  Pick them as top five team. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1214.7s)]
*  You'd want to be last summer. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1216.58s)]
*  You know, yeah, Luke alone makes you say that. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1218.58s)]
*  I think Denver after the summer of 23, no question. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1223.02s)]
*  And then even after last summer, you still would have said it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1226.26s)]
*  And now this summer you're wondering what the hell they're going to do because [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1229.3799999999999s)]
*  the league has shifted and you need seven, eight guys realistically. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1232.26s)]
*  They have four. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1236.06s)]
*  So what do they do? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1237.62s)]
*  Four and a half, depending on what they get from Porter. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1238.38s)]
*  Um, but then going back even further, like they think about that Buck Suns finals. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1240.7800000000002s)]
*  Like, Oh man, these teams are, these teams are set. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1245.5s)]
*  Suns look great. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1249.14s)]
*  And then within two years that Suns thing completely fell apart. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1250.5800000000002s)]
*  Um, let me ask you it this way. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1253.6200000000001s)]
*  If you got the phone call and it was the owner of the calves, the owner of the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1255.7800000000002s)]
*  Pacers and the owner of, well, we can't even put the Celtics in here. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1260.74s)]
*  I don't think Orlando. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1265.3000000000002s)]
*  It's too much money. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1266.66s)]
*  No. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1268.3000000000002s)]
*  And it would you be too emotional about it? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1268.6200000000001s)]
*  You're like, hold on. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1270.0600000000002s)]
*  I got to sit down first. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1270.54s)]
*  Uh, if, if you were just the hot, like, Hey man, it's, it's like, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1271.98s)]
*  pick a roster. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1278.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1280.02s)]
*  Peak woge is like, look, he's been putting in the hours that the 20 plus years of [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1280.3000000000002s)]
*  hearing his thoughts on things like the, out of this NBA owners meeting down here [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1284.8600000000001s)]
*  in Tampa, Bill Simmons is the story. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1289.5800000000002s)]
*  They want to make this guy a GM and you've got these three teams fighting over you. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1292.1000000000001s)]
*  Pacers. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1296.98s)]
*  Magic. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1297.94s)]
*  We did that. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1299.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1299.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1299.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1300.58s)]
*  And be like, all right, Bill, like take your pick. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1300.94s)]
*  I think I've won Indiana. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1305.26s)]
*  I think I'd have the, I think I would, I think the Cleveland piece, there's the [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1307.62s)]
*  amount of money you have to shell out for the team they have with all this apron [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1312.3s)]
*  stuff, I think is really prohibitive. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1316.58s)]
*  Orlando. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1318.7s)]
*  I really would have to study Orlando because I would have those three guys [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1319.4199999999998s)]
*  would have to be my guys. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1324.54s)]
*  I think with the Cleveland part, that's interesting is you have outs all over [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1325.7s)]
*  the place. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1328.8600000000001s)]
*  I can trade Garland. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1329.78s)]
*  I could trade, uh, Allen and I can trade Mobley. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1331.5s)]
*  Like I have three guys that I know have real value that I can turn into multiple [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1334.26s)]
*  pieces if I have to, whereas Indiana, I probably have less outs to blow stuff up. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1337.66s)]
*  Cleveland also has no pants. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1344.82s)]
*  Best player on the Pacers. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1346.22s)]
*  I don't know, but that, but this is what's so crazy about this year. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1348.74s)]
*  You're almost better off having a team like how they built it versus the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1352.9s)]
*  traditional three guys and then a bunch of James Posey, Eddie houses. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1357.26s)]
*  Like that, it feels like those days are over, you know, that's why okay. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1361.3400000000001s)]
*  See, I mean, there and okay. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1365.5800000000002s)]
*  Say is clearly the answer in the other conference. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1367.94s)]
*  There's a moment with that draft when, uh, when it's, it's in like, they're [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1370.0600000000002s)]
*  going to get the seventh pick where it wasn't just, they were going to get the [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1375.8600000000001s)]
*  seventh pick from Philly. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1380.42s)]
*  Dallas was also going to get fucked and they have Dallas is, I think it's like [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1381.9s)]
*  top two protected 20, 29 pick. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1386.42s)]
*  So they basically lost two picks in that trade, like two prime picks cause Dallas [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1389.0200000000002s)]
*  was never going to get back there. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1394.18s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1396.14s)]
*  I have this. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1396.5s)]
*  They have a swap rights with Dallas in 28. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1397.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1402.0200000000002s)]
*  And 28 think about that. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1402.2600000000002s)]
*  That's three summers from now. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1405.98s)]
*  So instead of like them having this juicy swap pick at 28, they're really, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1408.18s)]
*  oh, three, and then on top of getting seventh pick in this draft, which would [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1412.5800000000002s)]
*  have been huge, they don't get the seventh pick and then Dallas gets replenished. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1417.78s)]
*  And that picks probably not going to be that important, but I'm not crying for [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1422.94s)]
*  a okay seat because they're still pretty loaded. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1426.3400000000001s)]
*  Somebody had the 15th and 24 picks in this draft. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1429.06s)]
*  They would know. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1433.38s)]
*  I mean, they have so many players. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1433.98s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1435.18s)]
*  I assume I was trying to figure out how they could work around the fringes [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1436.22s)]
*  because, you know, they have this SGA contract now he can either make 200. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1440.26s)]
*  He can sign a four year, $293 million extension this summer, or he can wait [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1447.78s)]
*  and sign for five, three 80 next summer. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1453.5s)]
*  Either way he's, he's going from making 38 million to like 60. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1456.5s)]
*  And then, uh, Chet and Jane Williams are both extension eligible pretty soon. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1461.3s)]
*  I think this summer, they're going to have to deal with that at some point. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1465.82s)]
*  Um, they have heart and steam 28.5 next year, and then team option on that. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1469.3400000000001s)]
*  After they have Dord at 17.7 team option after that, Caruso at 18, 19 and a [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1474.14s)]
*  half and 21, they have Wallace on a cheap contract Wiggins. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1479.9s)]
*  I assume if they wanted to trade somebody to create some money, I would [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1484.1000000000001s)]
*  assume Dort would be the guy. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1488.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1489.82s)]
*  If you wanted to send money out because you know, you have to shift that money [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1491.14s)]
*  toward SGA, I think Dort would be the most expendable and I also think Dort [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1494.94s)]
*  would have a lot of, I think a lot of value out there. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1500.42s)]
*  That's the kind of guy everybody's looking for and get somebody like [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1504.54s)]
*  that for under 20 million a year. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1506.98s)]
*  Um, but other than that, I think this is going to be their roster. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1508.82s)]
*  Plus they have top edge coming out, uh, coming off the knee surgery next year. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1511.06s)]
*  So you could, he's going to get some minutes from somebody. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1514.82s)]
*  So I would assume, right. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1518.02s)]
*  You agree with that? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1518.98s)]
*  I think Dord's on that team next year. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1520.14s)]
*  Uh, just give us well minutes to Wallace. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1524.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1527.42s)]
*  I mean, clearly you can already see the replacement there. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1527.94s)]
*  I don't know that Wallace, I mean, it doesn't have to be like a perfect fit [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1530.46s)]
*  because there's going to be some stuff that Dord can do against bigger guys. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1535.22s)]
*  Uh, as much as we've all enjoyed watching Wallace grow into a player here. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1537.98s)]
*  We didn't even mention it was Monjang. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1541.98s)]
*  So, I mean, they unleashed that beast. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1543.5800000000002s)]
*  Uh, I would rather be, I'd rather be expensive. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1545.9s)]
*  And worry about being expensive than be less talented and less expensive. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1550.02s)]
*  We just haven't seen them have the appetite to spend. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1555.66s)]
*  It would be the counter. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1559.74s)]
*  I wouldn't, I wouldn't say they've been, uh, money. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1561.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1563.5s)]
*  Well, I think you're missing. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1563.5800000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1564.42s)]
*  See, like you're throwing a lot of like, Hey, look at what this like is going to [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1564.6200000000001s)]
*  be like and all the second apron stuff that we've been talking about the last few [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1568.3000000000002s)]
*  weeks and all of this looming. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1571.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1573.5s)]
*  Um, I mean, sure it'd be great if you were running a team that had some [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1573.74s)]
*  flexibility, but I'd rather have the talent first and then figure out what [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1578.66s)]
*  my salary is going to look like as opposed to being cheaper going, do I have [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1584.66s)]
*  that kind of high end talent, but. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1588.3000000000002s)]
*  No, they know, but they know they have money coming with those three guys [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1590.5400000000002s)]

*  That's here. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1596.5800000000002s)]
*  That's probably here this summer. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1597.46s)]
*  I don't know what, if he's going to pick the summer next summer for that [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1598.5800000000002s)]
*  extension and chat and Jaylen Williams are going to be max guys are close. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1601.1000000000001s)]
*  I would assume. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1607.38s)]
*  Jaylen Brown, Jaylen Brown, corollary on those two guys. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1608.38s)]
*  I think he's going to be hitting. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1611.5s)]
*  Although Chet's an interesting one because he's already been injured twice [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1612.74s)]
*  and plays a position that, um, usually it's a little discounting at the center [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1616.14s)]
*  position compared to the other positions for whatever reason. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1620.58s)]
*  So maybe, I don't know. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1624.02s)]
*  I don't know what he lands. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1625.1s)]
*  You could tell me any number. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1626.14s)]
*  I would believe it. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1627.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's going to be really good if he's healthy. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1630.26s)]
*  I mean, he just has moments. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1632.42s)]
*  I mean, he took Rudy. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1633.82s)]
*  I mean, granted came through, they got destroyed. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1634.74s)]
*  Like he had a play where like Rudy was on him. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1637.06s)]
*  And I mean, he, he worked him like he was a point guard. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1639.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1641.58s)]
*  And I went, holy shit. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1641.98s)]
*  Like he has these moments where, um, you know, more touches on a, on a weaker [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1643.06s)]
*  team would probably mean his profile was even higher, but there's just in the [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1647.74s)]
*  course of the way this team works. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1651.82s)]
*  I mean, he's rarely going to be the first guy they're looking at unless [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1654.18s)]
*  the players run for him, but that just doesn't happen very often. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1657.1399999999999s)]
*  Uh, I I'll tell you the same thing that I've said throughout all of this. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1659.62s)]
*  Like if the Pacers end up in the finals, um, you know, who knows what happens there? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1663.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1668.02s)]
*  See who was a great shooting team. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1668.3000000000002s)]
*  Um, the kind of, I don't know if it's like thunder fans understand this, but I [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1670.42s)]
*  was going through their shooting numbers and it really doesn't have anything to do [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1673.78s)]
*  with getting their ass in game three, but they're just not shooting the ball well [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1677.38s)]
*  at all and Denver made that gamble. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1680.22s)]
*  And I know I think at some point we'll talk about the Western [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1684.94s)]
*  commerce finals, but Denver makes that gamble and it, you know, but sure. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1687.5s)]
*  Game seven goes the way it went. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1690.98s)]
*  So it doesn't feel like they were in it, but I mean, they get them to game seven, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1692.7s)]
*  considering what we thought of about those two teams, the closer regular [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1695.42s)]
*  season and you keep trying to figure out like the offensive rating still pretty [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1697.8200000000002s)]
*  good for them for a bunch of different reasons, but this team is just not shot [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1701.46s)]
*  it well at all and they've been one of the best shooting teams in the league. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1704.6200000000001s)]
*  And it seems like, you know, Denver was the one to go, we're just going to find [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1707.98s)]
*  a way to sell out and not trust that those guys are going to hit their shots [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1711.7s)]
*  around you and for the most part they were right. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1714.18s)]
*  So, um, I don't think there is another argument though. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1715.7s)]
*  I think there's probably some women Yama stuff, but I feel like that is like [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1719.78s)]
*  rounding way up for anyone to pick San Antonio because of one guy versus what [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1723.58s)]
*  this roster has been from Presti. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1729.5s)]
*  Did you see he might've grown to read that story? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1732.02s)]
*  People were studying photos of him and they think he might be seven foot seven [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1736.42s)]
*  now that he grew an inch. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1739.82s)]
*  I hope he isn't seven foot seven. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1743.06s)]
*  Seven foot seven is nuts. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1745.34s)]
*  We talked about it as a draft. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1747.86s)]
*  I mean, it's the first player I've ever heard of the agents trying to [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1748.9s)]
*  temper his true height the other way. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1751.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, like he's definitely seven five on your OKC point. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1754.3000000000002s)]
*  Um, they're shooting 32.4% from three in these 14 games. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1760.02s)]
*  And it was something they've, you know, they've just been killing everybody [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1765.66s)]
*  and their defense is so great, but it's also a team that if they fall behind by [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1768.5s)]
*  20, I feel like they just can't come back because they're not explosive enough. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1772.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1775.74s)]
*  And part of the reason they fall behind by 20 is because they're younger guys [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1776.1799999999998s)]
*  are usually not playing well, but when they fell behind by Minnesota, um, in [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1779.74s)]
*  game three, it just feels like they don't have that same kind of explosiveness [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1785.02s)]
*  unless it comes from their defense and their defense. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1788.4599999999998s)]
*  What did you see in that game that you felt like Minnesota unlocked anything? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1790.78s)]
*  Well, the number one rule that I always have is you can't fake desperate. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1796.6599999999999s)]
*  And if you're any good and you're down two, oh, and you're going home, like [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1799.6599999999999s)]
*  there's just no way the other team's going to come out of the tunnel with the [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1802.82s)]
*  same desperation that you have. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1805.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1806.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1806.78s)]
*  Um, game two, Finch and the staff through the kitchen sink defensively at. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1807.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1812.1799999999998s)]
*  See, and Finch talked about like going back and watching the Denver series, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1812.5s)]
*  because if there was one concept of the Denver series, it was like, once they [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1816.74s)]
*  got settled into that zone, they're like, look, if we can at least stop the first [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1819.5s)]
*  thing that they want to do, which is SGA coming downhill at the top of the key. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1824.62s)]
*  And Denver deserves credit for disrupting that part of it. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1828.7s)]
*  Uh, and that's where the stuff we were talking about earlier with the gamble [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1831.98s)]
*  that you're willing to take going. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1834.58s)]
*  I don't know if the guys around SGA are going to hit enough threes and [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1836.02s)]
*  they still really haven't. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1839.26s)]
*  I mean, you're right. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1840.3s)]
*  Like these offensive numbers, I mean, 32% in the playoffs is 13 out of [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1840.8999999999999s)]
*  the 16 playoff teams, they were six best in the NBA this season. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1844.6599999999999s)]
*  Granted, you know, the number doesn't feel like it's that big of a difference [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1848.1799999999998s)]
*  at 37%, the offensive rating is okay. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1850.62s)]
*  The defensive rating is off the charts. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1854.6599999999999s)]
*  It's even two points better per 100 possessions, um, than it was in the [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1856.8999999999999s)]
*  regular season when it was historically one of the best defensive ratings a [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1860.6599999999999s)]
*  team has had based on the differential from the average defensive rating. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1863.82s)]
*  So they've cranked that part of it up even more, but back to the original [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1867.8999999999999s)]
*  thing of like what you had asked. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1870.78s)]
*  Minnesota clearly, when they were just dazed again in that third quarter, you [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1873.3s)]
*  could see like Finches pulled Rudy. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1876.9399999999998s)]
*  Then he's put him back in. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1879.4199999999998s)]
*  He's had him in drop. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1881.02s)]
*  I thought that they did less drop in game three when they went to zone. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1882.62s)]
*  They were a fucking mess because they know they don't play it. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1886.3799999999999s)]
*  And Finch had even said, like, we saw them do the zone stuff. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1889.1799999999998s)]
*  So it was like, Hey, we'll do some of that too. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1892.7s)]
*  And then Minnesota's letting Caruso and Chet and these guys get this super easy [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1895.0600000000002s)]
*  catch that once you have that catch in the paint inside of a zone, then [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1899.98s)]
*  everybody's scrambling and if you don't play it, then it's just even NBA players [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1903.98s)]
*  are going to be making mistakes being like, wait, where's like, who am I [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1908.5800000000002s)]
*  helping off of, or if I'm helping here, am I, is there somebody behind me? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1911.3000000000002s)]
*  And so that turned out to be a disaster. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1915.7s)]
*  So. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1917.66s)]
*  Look, it's great when ant comes out and score 16 points. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1918.5800000000002s)]
*  It's great when the team starts shooting threes because so many of their guys [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1921.22s)]
*  have been abysmal on the Minnesota side of shooting threes in those first two [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1924.18s)]
*  games, but they were so much more aggressive to kind of getting back to who [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1927.42s)]
*  they are of just letting their athletes get after the ball handler. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1931.94s)]
*  Um, you guys, Shannon played. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1936.18s)]
*  You know, he's older than ant. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1938.82s)]
*  He's 25 in July. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1940.06s)]
*  Come on. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1941.94s)]
*  Young Shannon. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1944.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1947.06s)]
*  It's going to take him under his weight. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1947.38s)]
*  Even though it was two years old. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1948.66s)]
*  Was out there being like, I'll give you the whole package son. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1950.18s)]
*  Well, it sounds like, it sounds like yesterday they were just like, we need [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1953.78s)]
*  more athletes out there, Shannon go out there, be an athlete. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1956.74s)]
*  I mean, the score was so one sided that I don't know like any of the tactical [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1960.3400000000001s)]
*  stuff necessarily Matt, but like game two, I thought was defensive desperation. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1964.5800000000002s)]
*  And I don't even mean that as a criticism bill. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1969.8600000000001s)]
*  It's like, all right, we got to figure something out. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1971.5400000000002s)]
*  Like, like you could see at the very beginning of this series, as she is [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1973.38s)]
*  like, oh shit, I get to drive again. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1977.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1979.5400000000002s)]
*  And it was like, all right, this is finally like, this is who I've been for six months. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1980.42s)]
*  I mean, does that make sense to you that we could talk tactics and all that stuff. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1984.7s)]
*  When you're down 20 like that. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1988.18s)]
*  Um, you know, I don't even know. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1990.14s)]
*  I don't know if we'll see that zone again, but it was, I thought they were [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1991.9s)]
*  trying everything in game two and it was just a mess. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1995.46s)]
*  I agree. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=1999.3400000000001s)]
*  Um, the biggest thing I noticed other than the zone was that Rando was getting [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2000.5400000000002s)]
*  the ball in the right spots without okay. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2005.54s)]
*  See doing the thing where it just felt like he was getting smothered [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2007.54s)]
*  every time you had the ball. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2010.18s)]
*  And this is the part I don't understand with okay. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2012.1s)]
*  See, cause we saw in the Denver series too, there were games where it felt like [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2013.94s)]
*  Yoke edge was doing every single thing he wanted from all the spots on the floor. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2016.78s)]
*  We want to do it. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2020.06s)]
*  And then there were other games that just felt like he was in a tsunami. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2021.1399999999999s)]
*  And if okay. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2024.82s)]
*  See, he's not playing with that tsunami defense, at least for Rando it's great. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2025.8999999999999s)]
*  And I just felt like he was physical and impactful in a way that in game two, it [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2031.1399999999999s)]
*  was like, is he going to be playable anymore? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2035.38s)]
*  He's just had three awful quarter, three awful halves. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2036.8200000000002s)]
*  He was really good in the first half of game one and then just disappeared after [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2040.1000000000001s)]
*  that. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2042.7s)]
*  So they unlocked him. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2043.3400000000001s)]
*  They were able to at least survive with go bear out there, which in fact, that [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2045.14s)]
*  felt iffy in the first, in the, especially in the second game, isn't go bear. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2048.58s)]
*  Cause it's like certain nights you just go, Oh, thank God he's out there. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2053.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2058.6600000000003s)]
*  He's deterring some of these drives. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2058.98s)]
*  And then other times you just go like, and I think you've seen that from Finch. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2060.42s)]
*  Throughout the playoffs. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2065.58s)]
*  I mean, even in going back to the Lakers series, there'll be these stretches. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2066.5s)]
*  And I think that's kind of what playoff basketball is, is that the same thing can [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2070.3s)]
*  look like a completely different product 48 hours later, but Rudy has had moments [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2074.46s)]
*  where it's like, thank God for Rudy. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2079.2200000000003s)]
*  And then other times you're like, all right, Finch is going to get him out of [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2080.9s)]
*  there. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2083.1800000000003s)]
*  Then he had one possession where I saw like, he tried to go small and then he [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2083.42s)]
*  was, I think it was game two and Finch was just so frustrated. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2088.54s)]
*  I think he put Rudy right back in the game. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2091.26s)]
*  Cause he was like, all right, whatever. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2092.78s)]
*  It was like such a bad defensive possession. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2094.94s)]
*  Do you, do you have anything like, is there any part of you with OKC as we [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2097.18s)]
*  looked at this final four of you and like, this is their title to lose. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2101.22s)]
*  Is there any resetting for you at all with that kind of result in game three? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2104.7s)]

*  All right. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2228.02s)]
*  So you asked me if I feel any differently about okay. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2228.26s)]
*  See after game three, I left game two thinking that they were not going to [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2230.2200000000003s)]
*  lose another playoff game and that they had gone up a level defensively. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2233.9s)]
*  And they were just going to go on one of those runs like the 91 bulls did. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2238.38s)]
*  There's some great young teams over the years that just as the playoffs went [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2242.7000000000003s)]
*  along, they started going up levels and just wax and everybody. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2246.14s)]
*  I think the Oh one Lakers were like this too. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2250.78s)]
*  I mean, they basically only lost one game in overtime to Philly, but [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2252.62s)]
*  teams that just got better as the playoffs go along. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2255.54s)]
*  And I thought that's what we were watching with. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2258.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2259.6600000000003s)]
*  See, I don't get surprised very much. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2259.94s)]
*  I know game three, it's always a zag. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2263.34s)]
*  It's always the desperation thing. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2265.46s)]
*  The line was only okay. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2267.26s)]
*  See minus two, which I was talking with Rahim and JJ house and Sal about the [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2268.5s)]
*  line and just like, this might be our last chance ever to have okay. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2273.2200000000003s)]
*  See. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2276.3s)]
*  At a spread that that's low. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2277.46s)]
*  And finally it went up to three and then they just sucked and they seemed young. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2278.82s)]
*  And I w I was surprised by it because I figured they would know that Minnesota [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2284.1800000000003s)]
*  was going to come out like they did. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2289.1800000000003s)]
*  I thought aunt was good in game two. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2290.74s)]
*  If you look back at like his, the pace that he had and how he played [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2292.3s)]
*  and the decisions he made, it was really good. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2295.34s)]
*  There was some good stuff about that the next day. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2296.94s)]
*  Um, but I was just surprised they seemed young. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2299.82s)]
*  And I, one of the things that stood out yesterday was go bear just seemed big. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2302.42s)]
*  In some spots in a way that, um, I just didn't feel in the first two games that [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2306.46s)]
*  felt like physically, uh, they overpowered okay. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2310.82s)]
*  See a little bit. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2314.62s)]
*  Ultimately, I don't think okay. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2315.94s)]
*  So he loses again. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2316.94s)]
*  I would still bet on, I think this is now five instead of four. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2317.7s)]
*  In Minnesota at least showed they had a little on reserve, but I still think [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2321.26s)]
*  okay, see is just, I know they can crank up that defense for whatever reason. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2324.9s)]
*  When they fall behind 15, something happens to them psychologically. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2329.74s)]
*  I don't think they're a very good come from behind team. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2332.9s)]
*  They did it once against Memphis and that John Moran game when he got hurt. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2335.18s)]
*  But in general, I just think they're built to have a lead and protect it. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2339.62s)]
*  It's almost like those NFL teams that they just need to go up 10 and then [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2342.42s)]
*  their defense can finish the game. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2346.1s)]
*  I think that's who they are. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2348.14s)]
*  Well, I think some of the three points shooting numbers that we [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2350.78s)]
*  talked about would be part of that. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2352.58s)]
*  I mean, when they were having some of those bad closes against Denver, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2354.06s)]
*  and then that entire storyline shifted when Denver looked like the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2357.22s)]
*  disastrous team late and then they win game six with having the Strother game. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2360.82s)]
*  Sometimes you're like, okay, so okay, see only played 24 clutch games. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2366.7s)]
*  Does that mean that they're less comfortable in clutch games and all this other stuff? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2369.78s)]
*  You're like, I don't know if they played in seven more clutch games, then they [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2373.06s)]
*  would, they would be, I mean, it just sounds good because you have some [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2376.5s)]
*  to point to and say, Hey, nobody's played the less clutch games there. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2379.54s)]
*  They're, but over a quarter of their games were still technically [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2382.62s)]
*  clutch games in the regular season. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2385.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not like they played four of them out of 82. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2387.02s)]
*  So I think it sounded really good. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2390.22s)]
*  It was hard for me to buy it. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2392.38s)]
*  And then guess what happened? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2394.22s)]
*  Like the better team ended up figuring it out. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2395.34s)]
*  The team with the MVP figures it out and you know, you expect the shooting [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2397.3s)]
*  variance at some point to kick in here. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2402.46s)]
*  But if you're trying to figure out like, how do you get your ass to [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2404.18s)]
*  your ass that bad? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2408.34s)]
*  Maybe part of it is like Minnesota, I think is good. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2411.3s)]
*  No, I, I'm surprised that at least one of those games and [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2414.34s)]
*  okay, see wasn't a down to the wire game. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2418.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, we can see it was heading that way and they just couldn't land the [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2421.1800000000003s)]
*  plane on it and they let a couple. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2425.3s)]
*  That's what's crazy about this. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2427.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2428.86s)]
*  See team. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2429.1400000000003s)]
*  All they have these 10 Oh runs and all of a sudden you're like, fuck, we're [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2429.58s)]
*  down 12, what happened, you know, especially with their defense at home. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2432.58s)]
*  And it might be one of those things. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2436.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2438.18s)]
*  See, might just be an awesome home playoff team. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2438.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2441.8599999999997s)]
*  And they're going to have home court and maybe they're just going to be one of [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2442.3399999999997s)]
*  those teams where old school, like the splits at home versus them on the road [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2444.7s)]
*  is a little different. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2448.4199999999996s)]
*  Um, I, uh, I think there's one way Minnesota hangs and I think [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2450.02s)]
*  you would agree with this. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2458.9399999999996s)]
*  Edwards was, I thought really good in game two, even though his team wasn't. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2459.9s)]
*  And I thought he was really good yesterday and maybe that's the roadmap for them. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2465.86s)]
*  I thought he was patient. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2470.94s)]
*  Um, I, I really felt like he was trying to solve what they were doing. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2472.58s)]
*  They were throwing all kinds of dudes in him and he was handling it. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2477.06s)]
*  And I just was really impressed. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2480.1s)]
*  I thought it was a sophisticated game. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2481.86s)]
*  Whereas compared to last year in the Dallas series, where I thought he kind of [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2483.94s)]
*  unraveled a little bit of a problem. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2486.7400000000002s)]
*  The more Dallas threw at him, I thought he had trouble handling it. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2488.2599999999998s)]
*  And this, in those last two games, I didn't. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2491.06s)]
*  So that would be the case. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2493.2999999999997s)]
*  If you're excited about Minnesota is like, Hey, aunt might be, something [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2494.2599999999998s)]
*  might be happening here, but it only happens when the other guys are making shots. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2497.22s)]
*  So when you have Naz, miss 17 straight threes, Devin Chenzo, who, you know, I [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2501.62s)]
*  don't always love every coach after a game being like, I liked her looks. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2505.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2510.02s)]
*  I've yet to ever hear a coach. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2510.8999999999996s)]
*  I don't know if I've heard a coach. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2512.18s)]
*  I mean, it's probably been said at some point, like, you know, I'm not sure [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2513.22s)]
*  a lot of good ones tonight. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2515.82s)]
*  Didn't love our looks. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2516.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2517.6600000000003s)]
*  Devin Chenzo, who I would agree with Finch, like I've liked so many of his looks. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2518.2200000000003s)]
*  He's going to be better than five at 18. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2523.7400000000002s)]
*  And granted he hit two and game three, but he only took three. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2525.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, granted some of the overall stats again from game three. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2527.9s)]
*  I don't even know necessarily what they'll mean. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2530.78s)]
*  Cause you're down 20, 30 minutes after you're tying your shoes. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2532.5400000000004s)]
*  If you're on the thunder side of things, but none of the ant stuff works [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2535.46s)]
*  unless these guys are making shots. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2539.98s)]
*  And for the first two games, it was pretty abysmal. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2542.78s)]
*  Minnesota was under 30%. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2546.86s)]
*  And then I think the other part is kind of the Randall it's getting close [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2548.98s)]
*  to midnight conversation of if you look at who he was in those first two series [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2553.1s)]
*  and you go on any metric you want to look at and who he has been throughout [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2559.46s)]
*  his career in the playoffs and like, it just ends up being part of the national [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2563.46s)]
*  broadcast. I know they have access to these guys and it's like, you know, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2566.42s)]
*  people doubted this guy and play like, well, no shit. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2568.7000000000003s)]
*  We doubted him in the playoffs. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2570.62s)]
*  Like, give me the evidence that told me I was supposed to be psyched about it. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2572.1s)]
*  And he played great. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2577.7000000000003s)]
*  And his matchups, you know, he, he was like, when he got LeBron on him, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2580.02s)]
*  seeing it live and seeing a TV, he was like, let's go. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2584.9s)]
*  It was shocking. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2588.9s)]
*  You know, Draymond, very honest, very honest, very honest. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2589.7400000000002s)]
*  Draymond, very honest, which is sometimes like surprising. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2594.06s)]
*  And he talked about how much Siakam had eaten him up and how much Randall, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2598.5s)]
*  you know, it taken him out in his matchup. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2602.42s)]
*  But granted, I think Draymond in that series against Minnesota was tasked [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2604.34s)]
*  with doing a ton of stuff. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2607.42s)]
*  So I don't look at like I don't look at Draymond's defensive run to the playoffs [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2608.86s)]
*  against Houston and Minnesota. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2611.9s)]
*  And I'm not sitting here upset because I think he was asked to do a ton of stuff [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2613.06s)]
*  and for the most part battle. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2616.18s)]
*  But you look at it and you're like, holy shit, like, do you realize like how [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2617.62s)]
*  special Randall has been with these 10 games? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2621.34s)]
*  And it's like, OK, well, now you get OKC and it's not just the primary defender. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2623.98s)]
*  It's all of that other stuff that's happening. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2628.1800000000003s)]
*  And immediately, like the start of game one, it's like, hey, this back down [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2629.9s)]
*  turn dribble thing that takes a little while for you to set up. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2633.1000000000004s)]
*  So Randall not being that secondary on ball creator [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2635.86s)]
*  and getting benched in game two, which is all you need to know. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2640.02s)]
*  Like, hey, I wonder how they feel about him. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2643.86s)]
*  Well, he played 32 of the first 36 minutes, and now he's not going to play [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2645.3s)]
*  any of the fourth quarter. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2648.98s)]
*  They had it to 10390. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2650.82s)]
*  And that was social clip that he was telling his family to leave [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2652.82s)]
*  with like six minutes left in game two. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2655.7400000000002s)]
*  But that was weird. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2657.46s)]
*  It was like Finch told him not, you know, we're going to make a run [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2658.86s)]
*  without you, don't get mad. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2662.5s)]
*  I need you for game three. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2664.26s)]
*  It looked weird. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2666.94s)]
*  I'll admit, my first instinct now in any social clip is that I don't believe [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2667.98s)]
*  that is the thing that's being told me. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2671.38s)]
*  I think, by the way, that's a great first instinct. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2673.3s)]
*  The first thing I think of the press conference clips where they're just like [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2676.7400000000002s)]
*  doctoring the audio out of the guy's mouth. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2679.58s)]
*  And you're like, wait, that guy said that. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2681.98s)]
*  Right. Then you realize, oh, they did a with this. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2683.86s)]
*  I think I fell for one of those once, but I didn't repost or anything. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2687.02s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, Harbaugh's like, let them like I know Harbaugh. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2690.34s)]
*  And I was like, oh, it's like, I don't think you'd say bitches, though. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2693.7s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that clip. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2697.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, if that's what it ended up being, you know, he handled it the right way. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2698.5s)]
*  And I also think there's a part of this, too, with with OKC. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2702.7799999999997s)]
*  It's incredibly frustrating. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2706.14s)]
*  And that first game was frustrating. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2707.34s)]
*  I mean, SG has seven free throws at the seven something mark of the first quarter. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2708.82s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, when Jayden chucked him in during game two, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2713.38s)]
*  I kind of liked it. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2717.7000000000003s)]
*  Like people just could pile that in to be like, oh, you know, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2718.7400000000002s)]
*  they're breaking at the seams. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2721.5800000000004s)]
*  The Timberwolves are just so frustrated. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2722.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they're kind of like it. I loved it. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2724.02s)]
*  I mean, it's like, fuck this guy because he had like the class we grew up with. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2725.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And then it kind of gets packages like, oh, this shows that Minnesota's [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2730.1800000000003s)]
*  breaking. It's like, I think he's just pissed and he's sick of this guy. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2733.6200000000003s)]
*  And by the way, that's not as she's free throws to me or not necessarily even the [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2737.06s)]
*  story, the outcome of the first two games here. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2741.1000000000004s)]
*  But it wasn't the free throws. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2744.6200000000003s)]
*  It was it was the calls he was getting when he banged in other bodies [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2747.78s)]
*  that didn't resemble. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2751.86s)]
*  Everything else that was being officiated in the entire playoffs, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2753.94s)]
*  he was doing it, he would be side to side with somebody and he put his arm out [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2756.9s)]
*  and the and McDaniel's had a couple of files where he's just like, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2760.5s)]
*  what the fuck am I supposed to do? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2764.06s)]
*  Am I should I run backwards? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2765.3s)]
*  When he fell down and fall down, when he fell down and they challenged it [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2767.2200000000003s)]
*  and the official was like pissed at Alexander Walker for being like, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2770.82s)]
*  you've got like Alexander Walker was like unhinged because he knew. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2774.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. He's like, he just fell down. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2777.26s)]
*  And then the ref kind of looked at him and like a ref when they get [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2778.6600000000003s)]
*  and I can't imagine being a ref and having guys yell at you for two and a half hours. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2781.1800000000003s)]
*  Like eventually you get sort of defensive and you know, all these guys, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2784.2200000000003s)]
*  that testosterone is flying around and the official gave it this like look like, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2787.06s)]
*  hey, you know, you fouled them and it's on him. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2790.5800000000004s)]
*  And it's like a little extra emphasis on what he's doing back in the scores. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2792.9s)]
*  You see the review and you're like, yeah, he just fell down. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2796.58s)]
*  That's why those guys were all losing their minds. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2799.66s)]
*  So they definitely got way too caught up in all that stuff. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2801.8599999999997s)]
*  I think Minnesota is a good team. I wasn't going to pick them in this series. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2806.2999999999997s)]
*  I thought the odds were a little crazy. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2808.9s)]
*  Then the odds looked like they might have been too low with the way [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2810.94s)]
*  the Thunder control those third quarters, the stuff that the Thunder can go to here. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2813.62s)]
*  But, you know, there's a Randall piece and the three point piece [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2817.22s)]
*  that makes Ant's night like it's predetermined. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2821.58s)]
*  If Randall can't do anything, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2824.86s)]
*  20 for 40 from three and Randall's going to play well and Ant's making good [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2826.14s)]
*  decisions. They're really good. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2829.98s)]
*  There you go. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2831.78s)]
*  With that said, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2834.7400000000002s)]
*  Caruso nine minutes. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2837.54s)]
*  Didn't he get a bunch of fouls though? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2840.26s)]
*  Yeah. I'm just, he was minus 16 when he was out there and it was the first bad [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2842.1s)]
*  Caruso game in a while. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2846.54s)]
*  Wallace only played 15 and he was minus 30 in the 15th. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2849.5s)]
*  I don't even know. Do these numbers matter though? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2854.94s)]
*  Yeah. I'm just, I'm trying to figure out like to me, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2856.94s)]
*  defense is going to be their identity in this series. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2859.42s)]
*  And my guess is they're going to try to come back and be like, dude, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2862.02s)]
*  we got here on defense. Let's play some defense again. When Caruso goes out, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2866.38s)]
*  there's like, give me Randall. That guy's not doing that again. He takes him. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2869.94s)]
*  They'll throw dudes at Edwards. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2874.58s)]
*  Just try to make him give up the ball and they're going to see if Minnesota can [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2877.18s)]
*  go 20 for 40 from three again, would be the strategy. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2880.82s)]
*  I still like okay. Same five. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2885.18s)]
*  Yeah. Look at the Caruso foul game was, was game two. Um, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2887.34s)]
*  I just don't know what any of the stats will mean from any of the guys. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2890.62s)]
*  And then, you know, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2895.34s)]
*  they were talking about it cause I was watching the broadcast a little bit with [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2896.14s)]
*  game three with, with Ruko legs and our guy, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2898.98s)]
*  Kirk Goldsberry. And I watched some of that too. It was, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2902.82s)]
*  it was delayed by two seconds. So that, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2906.18s)]
*  that I like to get as live as possible. So I ended up going back. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2909.02s)]
*  The two seconds having a big year, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2913.42s)]
*  big, big legs year. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2917.54s)]
*  He's been great. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2921.18s)]
*  Can you give me an actor equivalent of like 20 years later? It's like, man, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2923.2999999999997s)]
*  we appreciate this guy. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2928.06s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe it's kind of the surroundings. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2930.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Cause if you're in a neighborhood where you have one of like many good [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2933.58s)]
*  restaurants in the neighborhood and then you're one of the only ones left and [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2936.54s)]
*  say, man, the food, this place is great. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2939.62s)]
*  Might be one of those. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2942.94s)]
*  But Travolta, I'm trying to do a Travolta here for you. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2946.14s)]
*  Travolta's peaks were higher than earlier as legs peaks. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2949.2999999999997s)]
*  So Travolta just went away and it was a Travolta comeback cannot be compared. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2951.94s)]
*  He was literally six feet under in the ground and came back, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2957.22s)]
*  but he had these peaks. I don't think there's a satinite fever for legs. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2960.98s)]
*  What I'm trying to think of is the actor who has been around forever. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2963.94s)]
*  And then later on, I mean, you can't even do brain. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2967.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2971.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't, I don't know. I don't know about that. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2973.46s)]
*  Tommy Lee Jones. No country for old Ben. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2976.98s)]
*  Is it no country for old Ben for legs? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2980.5s)]
*  It might be because he was around, but I mean, I think it felt like he was [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2983.62s)]
*  having a bit of a comeback with the fugitive. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2988.34s)]
*  Right. And then he had that run in the nineties. Then it dipped again. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2992.14s)]
*  Then it came back where he played the same character for a decade. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2995.06s)]
*  Legs is doing great. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2998.02s)]
*  That might be at no country for old man. It's like, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=2999.14s)]
*  you can build the whole thing around this guy. Did you not realize this? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3000.94s)]
*  He'd been here the whole time. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3003.46s)]
*  Yeah. He's fucking awesome. Give him a giant monologue at the end. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3004.7400000000002s)]
*  He's going to crush it. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3007.94s)]
*  I was thinking, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3010.58s)]
*  I don't know whether I would call this the sea change season or the something's [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3011.9s)]
*  different season. I mentioned this to you last week and I was going through [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3015.14s)]
*  seasons [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3017.82s)]
*  that just feel like something has shifted. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3020.7000000000003s)]
*  It was back to your pacer's point, right? Cause if this is real, if this is normal, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3024.54s)]
*  this is the way you want to build your team. This goes against anything. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3028.14s)]
*  We've ever accepted. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3031.26s)]
*  We've gone from it's better to have nine than three. That's pretty weird, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3032.14s)]
*  but think all the things that happened this season, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3035.26s)]
*  LeBron and Curry feels like those errors are over as like, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3037.9s)]
*  if this is the best guy in your team, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3042.34s)]
*  that doesn't mean you're even going to make the finals. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3044.26s)]
*  Tatum goes down in the Boston thing, which goes from 2016 to this year. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3047.2200000000003s)]
*  Now it feels like it's in flux. The Luca trade, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3051.62s)]
*  which was the biggest trade in the history of the league, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3054.9s)]
*  Cooper flag to Dallas and okay. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3057.06s)]
*  See has arrived and San Antonio feels like they're reloading and it just feels [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3059.46s)]
*  like, it feels like the seesaw just went like this. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3063.5s)]
*  The last time I was looking through all the seasons, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3068.1s)]
*  trying to think when I felt like that with the season 2016, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3070.42s)]
*  when Cleveland be Golden state Golden state had beaten. Okay. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3075.18s)]
*  See, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3078.8599999999997s)]
*  and then the weird salary cap thing and Durant just went to the warriors and [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3079.1s)]
*  we're like, Oh, it just felt like a shift. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3082.74s)]
*  And for those listening, Bill did a thing where his balance was [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3087.62s)]
*  I did a thing with my arm. I did a, I did a fake human seesaw. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3090.06s)]
*  Imagine a plane and it's wings dipping. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3092.8599999999997s)]
*  2010 11 season right after the decision in Miami [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3097.46s)]
*  in the lockout was coming and it felt like the Celtics and Lakers had kind of [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3102.8199999999997s)]
*  run their course. We were in the tail end of Kobe and Gasol. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3107.58s)]
*  That felt like that was not going to the best place. KG Pierce, Ray, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3111.2599999999998s)]
*  that felt like that might be getting creaky. Okay. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3116.18s)]
*  So he was coming with Durant and those guys. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3119.1s)]
*  And we had all those awesome drafts in a row and Oh seven, Oh eight, Oh nine, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3122.54s)]
*  we're just all these young players are coming to the week. And it was like, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3126.46s)]
*  I don't know what's happening, but something's happening. And by the way, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3129.18s)]
*  we may not have basketball season next year. So it was just like, we're on edge. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3131.5s)]
*  And then the only other one I can think of was after MJ's, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3135.18s)]
*  he wins his last title and we immediately go into the lockout [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3140.8999999999996s)]
*  and Kobe and Duncan are coming and the league's about to shift that way. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3144.42s)]
*  And it seems like Grant, it seems like it's going to be Kobe, Duncan, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3147.06s)]
*  Granhill MJ's gone. We have this lockout. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3149.46s)]
*  The salaries are super weird. Every they're trying to get rid of these three year [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3153.1800000000003s)]
*  contracts for you get your in the league three years, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3157.94s)]
*  then you can sign for a hundred million dollars. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3160.7400000000002s)]
*  And it just felt like everything was fucked up. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3163.1s)]
*  Those were the seasons in the last 25 plus years that you could just tell [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3165.34s)]
*  something had changed. And I think this season feels like that. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3170.34s)]
*  So I wanted your take. I would put it in that class. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3173.06s)]
*  If the Pacers win this whole thing. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3177.9s)]
*  Well, that's like, right. Yeah. Then we're getting canned goods. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3180.18s)]
*  Even if they make the finals, I think it feels that way. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3185.38s)]
*  We get an Indiana okay. See finals. It's fucking crazy. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3187.98s)]
*  But what'll happen is that everyone will agree with you and say that this now is [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3191.1s)]
*  different. And as I've said this entire time, like I would need to have, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3194.9s)]
*  to have this happen. This would have to be the new normal. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3198.82s)]
*  Have this happen. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3201.02s)]
*  This would have to be the new normal for me to accept that this is the shift and [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3201.82s)]
*  that the league has changed. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3204.98s)]
*  I feel like we're already here though, for this reason. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3206.58s)]
*  Did you see that that there was a graphic about the 25 most followed Instagram [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3208.98s)]
*  accounts in the NBA, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3213.94s)]
*  which includes people like both ball brothers and Ben Simmons. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3216.54s)]
*  But it was like the NBA players are the most Instagram followers and none of the [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3219.7s)]
*  four teams left had a guy in the top 25. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3224.06s)]
*  I was like, that's feels like something. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3226.9s)]
*  Well, Bridges post suck. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3230.7000000000003s)]
*  Too much Tommy. Um, no, it just, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3236.6600000000003s)]
*  it just feels like I think you add everything up combined with where we're going [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3240.3s)]
*  with this lottery and it just feels like something. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3243.78s)]
*  And then the second apron thing, I didn't even mention that part. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3248.06s)]
*  And just where we're going financially. I don't even, I don't, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3251.06s)]
*  like you add all that together and say, I don't know what this, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3255.1s)]
*  what's going to happen with this league. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3257.7000000000003s)]
*  I still will refuse to believe that the outcome of this league will be dictated [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3261.5s)]
*  by players outside of the top 10 consistently. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3266.38s)]
*  I forgot to mention the media rights deal. We have new partners. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3269.66s)]
*  We have the end of inside the NBA. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3272.58s)]
*  Just the flux of this year, like feeling like we're adding, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3275.1800000000003s)]
*  we're ending something and heading towards something. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3278.62s)]
*  And there's also a study that says icebergs have gotten bigger for the first [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3282.54s)]
*  time. Global warming is maybe over the salary cap. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3286.34s)]
*  I don't know that I believe that it's over, but there's data. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3290.54s)]
*  There's new data bill. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3292.82s)]
*  You're not with me. It doesn't sound like, plus Cooper flag coming. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3296.02s)]
*  Well, Hey, if you want to hit me with all of the guys that are the marquee [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3299.2599999999998s)]
*  names and they're all kind of heading towards the end of this whole thing. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3304.34s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3307.94s)]
*  You can the Lakers. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3309.7s)]
*  I mean, if you're asking me like, Hey, new teams are going to start winning. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3311.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like, well, no shit like sports. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3315.1s)]
*  What's happened though? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3318.3399999999997s)]
*  Uh, well, like we're going to have Utah tanking, I guess, for the rest of the [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3319.7s)]
*  decade and still God only knows what's going to happen with them. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3324.18s)]
*  Look at Charlotte, look at Washington, you know, it's, and then you go on the [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3327.9s)]
*  other side, by the way, did you know Brooklyn has four first round picks? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3333.06s)]
*  For some reason, I didn't realize that until I was studying the draft and all [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3336.34s)]
*  the draft picks. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3340.26s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3341.78s)]
*  It's a really interesting spot. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3342.34s)]
*  I saw some bad like, Hey, package all four. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3344.0600000000004s)]
*  Like it's the NFL draft. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3346.86s)]
*  Like that is one of the biggest disconnects of all time. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3348.1400000000003s)]
*  Like if you were in the NFL and you say how give you 12, 17 and 20, like who [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3350.38s)]
*  knows, like you might be able to get it up the top five, the NBA when it's like, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3354.1000000000004s)]
*  we don't want 20, 21 and 27. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3357.5800000000004s)]
*  Like that's not going to get you right. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3362.0600000000004s)]
*  Uh, even though obviously Brooklyn's first pick is a lot higher than that. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3364.78s)]
*  I was, as I've mentioned, but even, even in the NBA, like if you're sitting there [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3367.2200000000003s)]
*  with eight and two other firsts, like, Hey, can we get to four? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3369.86s)]
*  No. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3372.62s)]
*  In the NFL, you could the NBA 19, 26 and 27. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3373.1s)]
*  How high could you move up with those four? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3376.86s)]
*  Could you get to fourth? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3380.94s)]
*  Would Charlotte do that? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3382.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't think you could get to fourth. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3383.46s)]
*  You don't think Charlotte Charlotte wants four more rookies. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3385.34s)]
*  No, no one wants four more rookies, by the way. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3388.82s)]
*  The only team I was thinking about that could potentially get excited is Darrell [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3391.54s)]
*  because he would just have all these picks. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3395.5s)]
*  It would be like his super bowl. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3397.18s)]
*  You'd be like, I'm going to get, I'm going to build an entire bench right now [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3400.9s)]
*  for my guy, Joel and bead. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3404.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3406.18s)]
*  But even the most confident GM isn't going to assume that he's going to hit on all [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3406.42s)]
*  four first round picks and then they're going to be rotational pieces for a team [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3413.1s)]
*  that when Philly's healthy has, you know, Eastern Conference, they're going to be [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3415.7799999999997s)]
*  you know, Eastern Conference finals aspirations, championship aspirations. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3420.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3424.26s)]
*  It's funny when, uh, how often do you look through when we think about all these [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3426.14s)]
*  teams that are loaded with all their picks and then you actually look at the picks? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3430.98s)]
*  You know, okay. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3436.34s)]
*  See is one of those that I thought, okay. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3437.06s)]
*  See, it was just like, holy shit. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3438.98s)]
*  They have so many awesome picks. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3440.42s)]
*  And now you go through it and I'm not sure they're that awesome, but they have two [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3442.78s)]
*  Denver top five protected picks down the road. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3447.02s)]
*  I've assumed yoga just still going to be there. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3450.18s)]
*  They have that Dallas swap and 28, but now they have Cooper flag. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3452.02s)]
*  They have clipper stuff and 26 and 27 swaps and this year, but the clipper [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3456.34s)]
*  is similar, they're going to be at least pretty functional for the next two years. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3463.3s)]
*  And then they have the Philly 26 first top six per sec protected top four [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3467.18s)]
*  protected the next year and Philly seems like they've reloaded. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3472.3s)]
*  They have the Utah top protect the top eight, right? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3476.94s)]
*  And 26, right. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3479.46s)]
*  That's not too much. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3481.18s)]
*  No, no, I didn't say that one, but I almost assume Utah is going to throw next year. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3482.54s)]
*  So they don't really have like a. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3487.02s)]
*  Genuinely juicy pick. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3489.66s)]
*  Whereas, you know, like Houston has Phoenix's 27 first, you know, and they [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3491.5s)]
*  have the ability to choose between Phoenix or Dallas's first and 29. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3499.06s)]
*  Like those are picks where you're like, Oh fuck. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3502.86s)]
*  Those are some, uh, those are some winners. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3506.3s)]
*  Brooklyn has a couple of good ones too. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3508.74s)]
*  Um, but, but again, it's like Brooklyn can swap with Houston and 27. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3511.4599999999996s)]
*  What does that do for you? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3517.54s)]
*  Houston's going to be really good. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3518.3799999999997s)]
*  So sometimes when these teams put together all these picks, Utah is [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3519.9399999999996s)]
*  interesting because they still have a bunch of those Minnesota and Cleveland [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3523.22s)]
*  picks bet left, but ironically, the best pick they have is that sneaky trade. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3527.1s)]
*  They made, um, near the deadline, that weird trade Phoenix made where they gave [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3531.9399999999996s)]
*  up the three firsts for their 2031 first, which Utah now has in their 2031 first. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3537.1s)]
*  Who the fuck's going to be in Phoenix in six years? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3545.42s)]
*  You know, that could, that could end up being, yeah, it might be both of us. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3548.22s)]
*  Um, the, the other one, there's some other weird trades that I just forgot. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3552.98s)]
*  Three of us just hanging out. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3557.02s)]
*  Well, Washington got Memphis's first round pick this year because they took Marcus [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3559.1s)]
*  smart to go back to our Marcus smart trade. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3564.86s)]
*  He went from I'm worth Chris steps, purzingis and two firsts basically to you [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3567.7400000000002s)]
*  have to trade a first to get rid of me to go to my next team. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3572.1800000000003s)]
*  That's pretty, uh, pretty dramatic. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3575.86s)]
*  Um, anyway, there was a reason I brought all this up. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3578.5s)]
*  Oh, because of, uh, cause we were talking about how fast things can flip for who [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3583.1800000000003s)]
*  we think is looking good, who knows. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3588.3s)]
*  You think Utah, if there's somebody that's available, but the agent says, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3592.38s)]
*  yeah, my guy will stay there. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3595.9s)]
*  Cause the idea of Utah taking another rookie guard, I mean, unless the [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3598.66s)]
*  evaluation, they just look at him and go, Hey, he's better than everybody we [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3601.54s)]
*  already have, and this was an upset and he shouldn't have been here. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3604.7799999999997s)]
*  No, maybe it's just, cause I think edge comb should be in the conversation [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3608.58s)]
*  with the other two Rutgers guys. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3613.5s)]
*  Um, I knew you were going to be in this corner. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3615.02s)]
*  I've been waiting for it. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3617.8599999999997s)]
*  I need to do more work, but I am a little surprised that after the combine, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3619.6600000000003s)]
*  whether during the combine or after it's like, okay, well, clearly we know who [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3626.3s)]
*  number one is and then it's Harper and then it's everybody else. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3629.34s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3634.34s)]
*  cause I said two weeks ago, um, even though all indications is Sania Santana [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3637.9s)]
*  just taken Harper, I don't know. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3642.86s)]
*  Edge comb seems like a, I know they are in a castle. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3646.5s)]
*  Like it would be weird to have both of them, I guess, but, um, I don't know. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3649.5s)]
*  And Harper's shooting is better than his numbers. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3653.9s)]
*  The reason his three point shooting percentage is way lower than you would [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3657.02s)]
*  want is cause he takes some terrible shots, which a lot of really big time, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3660.74s)]
*  high profile high school guys come in being like, you know, I've got to, I've [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3666.82s)]
*  got to take these to show that I'll take them. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3671.78s)]
*  So Harper, I think is going to be a better shooter than the numbers prove out. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3674.06s)]
*  And he does so many really good things like running the high pick and roll [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3678.66s)]
*  that you see all the time and all this stuff. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3682.1s)]
*  And like, you know, Castles had a really nice year and he certainly seems to [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3684.54s)]
*  have the mentality of like, you would think he's going to attack this as a [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3687.86s)]
*  competitor, that he's going to care, you know, that he's going to love basketball. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3692.7s)]
*  He's going to be frustrated in those moments where he feels like he's not [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3695.82s)]
*  good enough, like it was just everything, you know, we're always trying to [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3699.2999999999997s)]
*  guess with any of these guys. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3701.54s)]
*  But I don't feel like I see the same separation between Harper and edge comb [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3703.2599999999998s)]
*  that the draft conversation seems to be at right now. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3710.8599999999997s)]
*  Um, so when was the last time that's happened? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3714.18s)]
*  Where when in like April, May, we were like, Oh no, here's going to be the top [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3718.02s)]
*  four and then something shifted as we got to mid May, June. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3722.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3725.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3726.3799999999997s)]
*  Tatum was Tatum was like consensus mock third. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3726.58s)]
*  I just thought. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3729.46s)]
*  At the time, I think Tatum is the right example though. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3732.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3735.26s)]
*  But everybody knew it was like false is going first. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3735.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3737.66s)]
*  And everybody knew Lonzo was going to the Lakers. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3738.7400000000002s)]
*  So at least that was a little bit more accepted. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3740.26s)]
*  It just, you know, ace Bailey, if he was better, is your number two guy. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3742.02s)]
*  Like there's, isn't it more likely that he could drop versus go up? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3747.82s)]
*  Like when I found out he was six, seven and a half and not six, 10, I thought [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3752.66s)]
*  that was a complete game changer. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3756.06s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3757.78s)]
*  But remember we're going off and I hate the league did this and I'm probably [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3758.02s)]
*  one of the few people that even cares about this, but the no shoes thing. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3762.86s)]
*  Like Harper's listed at six, six, any measures six, four and a half of those [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3767.06s)]
*  shoes. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3771.1s)]
*  So now it's presented as this huge disappointment or like, what the hell's [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3771.7000000000003s)]
*  going on with these college programs? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3774.58s)]
*  Like I think one year in lacrosse, one of my roommates, just like they were [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3776.34s)]
*  like, Hey, what are you? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3780.38s)]
*  And he was like six, four, two 30. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3781.26s)]
*  And he, I didn't even think he was six feet. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3783.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3786.2200000000003s)]
*  And they just let him do it. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3786.7s)]
*  Um, so that's been going on in college for, for years and years. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3788.18s)]
*  I mean, it's probably a little bit tighter when you're one of the top players [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3792.06s)]
*  in the high school circuit and then you end up, you know, at a D one program. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3794.82s)]
*  But Harper is listed at six, six, and then he's six, four and a half. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3799.26s)]
*  And so it's the same thing with ACE. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3803.7s)]
*  It's like, Oh, I thought this guy was six, 10, six, 10 from six, seven and a [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3805.1s)]
*  half is a little bit different, but it, it frustrates me because then you've [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3808.26s)]
*  just, I mean, I know the simple thing is like, well, Hey, now they're just not [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3812.14s)]
*  in shoes. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3815.1s)]
*  So factor that in, but then it gets relayed as if all these guys are just [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3815.58s)]
*  across the board, comically shorter than all their listed heights. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3818.74s)]
*  But it's because [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3822.1s)]
*  was another one. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3822.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3823.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, it's because they used to let them up until very recently. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3824.1s)]
*  The official measurement was the measurement in shoes. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3827.62s)]
*  So all of the, this is where we need a sports are to really decide one way or [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3830.22s)]
*  the other with the measurements. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3834.1s)]
*  Are we going shoes or no shoes? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3835.2599999999998s)]
*  It's like when we talk about NFL season. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3836.7799999999997s)]
*  So we'd say in the 2001 pats or the 2002 pats that won the super bowl. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3838.98s)]
*  So the year the super bowl was played or the year we had the regular season, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3843.94s)]
*  there's just some things we haven't figured out as a country. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3847.58s)]
*  Well, maybe they were just like some stability. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3850.46s)]
*  Maybe it's a lot like the tariffs bill. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3852.62s)]
*  It's like, we need, you're going to have to take your medicine. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3854.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3856.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3857.5s)]
*  But, but trust us on this one. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3857.9s)]
*  Not a statement, not a position, just obviously the rationale behind it. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3860.66s)]
*  And maybe the NBA is looking at the same way and be like, well, he's going to [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3864.66s)]
*  just start terrifying everybody. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3867.9s)]
*  Maybe we can start. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3870.2200000000003s)]
*  Terrifying height. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3872.1s)]
*  I, uh, I think it would be most likely ace, but he's Bailey falls out of the top [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3874.26s)]
*  three, then stays in the top three. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3878.62s)]
*  And I still have, uh, edge cone. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3880.7400000000002s)]
*  I think climbing let's take a break. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3884.2200000000003s)]
*  I want to talk about Halbert. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3886.02s)]
*  All right. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3887.34s)]
*  Tyrese, Albert, and we're taping this before game three. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3887.62s)]
*  So he might, he might go one for 15 tonight with 12 turnovers. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3890.2200000000003s)]
*  I was thinking, um, turn the ball over a lot. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3895.42s)]
*  That's true. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3898.26s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3898.7s)]
*  I was thinking he's the best what if guy of this decade, considering all the [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3899.82s)]
*  teams and all the fanbases that can look at him and go, even Golden State. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3903.7400000000002s)]
*  And there was no way Golden State was taking him into during the COVID draft, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3909.46s)]
*  which the COVID draft will be doing documentaries about, cause we had no [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3913.02s)]
*  March madness and nobody could really work out and just doing zoom interviews. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3916.3s)]
*  Golden state knows Halbert and is absolutely perfect for them. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3920.26s)]
*  And there's not quite enough of a resume to take a guy who's probably [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3923.54s)]
*  in the seven to nine range at number two, it would have been really ballsy, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3928.3s)]
*  but you would have had to absolutely love the guy and they did try to [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3931.94s)]
*  trade back from what I heard, but nobody wanted to trade back. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3935.3s)]
*  Cause it was the COVID draft. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3938.02s)]
*  Nobody, but here's a guy who I would assume Curry is the perfect Steve [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3939.2200000000003s)]
*  Kerpware, but Halbert is probably a close second for how he sees the floor [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3944.0600000000004s)]
*  and how he loves the unconstructed chaos. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3947.86s)]
*  So you have them, you've Detroit taking, killing haze over him. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3950.6200000000003s)]
*  You have the Knicks. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3954.38s)]
*  Now this is a what if. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3955.54s)]
*  Now this is a what if in both directions because they take top and over him, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3956.8999999999996s)]
*  but it also leads to Brunson and all the good stuff that happens. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3963.14s)]
*  So you're, you're probably fine with that. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3965.7799999999997s)]
*  It worked out if you're a Knicks fan, Washington passes on him and takes our [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3967.22s)]
*  guy, obdia Phoenix was the most indefensible. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3970.54s)]
*  And we said this in the moment because they actually needed, you know, to [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3973.5s)]
*  think long-term Halbert and Booker together, they take Jaylen Smith who [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3977.06s)]
*  they wave after two years and then San Antonio passes on them. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3980.02s)]
*  So you have all of those teams before we get Sacramento number 12. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3983.66s)]
*  Then you have, this is my favorite one of all of these. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3987.7s)]
*  Philly could have traded Ben Simmons for him. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3991.14s)]
*  It was the Halbert and healed trade. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3993.5s)]
*  And I've argued with people about this for two years. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3995.22s)]
*  It was like, I was never on the table. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3997.3799999999997s)]
*  That was number the trade. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3998.58s)]
*  It was like, well, they traded. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=3999.2999999999997s)]
*  So bonus for Halbert and healed. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4002.06s)]
*  And they were offering some bonus for Ben Simmons. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4006.2599999999998s)]
*  So you can't say like, Oh, this couldn't have happened, but I just feel like if, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4008.9399999999996s)]
*  if Sacramento wanted Ben Simmons, which I think they did because their stories [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4013.18s)]
*  about it, could that have been Halbert and healed, and I just don't think, I [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4018.1s)]
*  don't think Philly thought he was a big enough star to see that. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4021.78s)]
*  And then you have the Sacramento piece. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4025.26s)]
*  Sacramento had him for a hundred and nine games. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4026.66s)]
*  Rosilla they had him for a year and two thirds. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4028.54s)]
*  And they were like Fox and Halbert. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4032.5s)]
*  And I don't know, this doesn't work. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4034.06s)]
*  They weren't going anywhere. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4035.18s)]
*  They had a chance to trade for some bonus, which made sense at the time. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4036.62s)]
*  It worked out. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4040.46s)]
*  They made, you know, they, they want to play off. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4041.26s)]
*  They got to the playoffs. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4043.98s)]
*  They did all the, uh, stuff they did, but, um, end up trading them. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4044.98s)]
*  So that is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight teams that are like, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4053.5s)]
*  Oh, fuck, we could have, we literally could have had that guy. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4058.7400000000002s)]
*  And now he's an Indian and he's not going anywhere. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4062.82s)]
*  I don't remember another player like that. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4065.06s)]
*  I would have to go back to like the 1990s when Jason Kade got traded twice. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4066.54s)]
*  And felt like he was available for a while there in the, in, on Dallas [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4071.74s)]
*  in the mid nineties when that team wasn't working out, but for somebody [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4075.86s)]
*  as talented as Halbert and it just kind of be available both in the [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4078.58s)]
*  draft and as trade bait, it's pretty unusual. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4082.22s)]
*  The Dallas thing is good, but I remember just having mash burn around who just [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4085.62s)]
*  was one of my favorites back in the day, the early SPN stuff. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4089.86s)]
*  And you'd be like, you know, and he was like, it was that bad. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4092.58s)]
*  Like it was just that bad. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4096.3s)]
*  And so, you know, when you're with it every single day, it's easy for us to be [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4098.5s)]
*  like, how could you ever be in the business of wanting to move off from Jason Kade? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4102.34s)]
*  But then again, you know, of his own doing it led to another [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4105.3s)]
*  transaction later on for him. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4109.820000000001s)]
*  So I was just talking about kid, I think with Raja the other day and, you know, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4111.34s)]
*  his highlights hold up in a way where I like watch the highlights and I fear [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4117.620000000001s)]
*  we're never going to see anything like it. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4121.820000000001s)]
*  You know, I go, were we ever going to be like this lucky to see a player that [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4124.3s)]
*  could see the game this way? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4128.02s)]
*  And you knew when you were watching it, even back when he was playing in college, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4130.1s)]
*  you're like, dude, this is something like incredibly special about this guy. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4133.14s)]
*  And again, he has this awesome career in the whole thing. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4135.86s)]
*  I don't know that we're putting Haliburton on that level, but I like what you're [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4138.94s)]
*  doing because you're trying to figure out like, why would you have moved on from? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4143.14s)]
*  I think the funniest thing about the Cibonis Haliburton deal is that it happens. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4146.02s)]
*  It's like, how do you do? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4151.1s)]
*  You can't, no one ever does a deal like this. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4152.02s)]
*  No one ever takes a lottery pick and then moves on from him this quickly, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4153.700000000001s)]
*  especially when it looks like you got it right with the pick and you can't believe [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4156.54s)]
*  he fell to where he fell and really fun trade when it happened. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4159.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4162.820000000001s)]
*  But then it, it's like, oh, here we go again with Sacramento. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4163.06s)]
*  And then Cibonis makes all NBA two seasons and it's kind of 48 games. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4167.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4174.06s)]
*  You look at, and you also look at like Cibonis career stuff this year. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4174.22s)]
*  Everybody's like, no, thanks. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4178.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4181.780000000001s)]
*  Cause the numbers are still really, really good, but it's pretty clear. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4183.38s)]
*  Like when he's your center, there are just limitations on what you can do. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4186.660000000001s)]
*  But Sacramento to even have that, that high seat a few years ago, like how can [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4191.660000000001s)]
*  you get on their case when they took a surplus and added a need and it's work [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4196.42s)]
*  and it's worked for a team that doesn't really get to sniff in this area. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4201.46s)]
*  But now we get to like, we're, we re litigate this trade so much. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4204.38s)]
*  Um, that I think it just proves once again, you can't ever give up on lottery [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4210.78s)]
*  talent, so you think it worked, even if you think it's redundant. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4214.54s)]
*  Well, or maybe you could make a, they traded the wrong guy case too. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4218.38s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4224.5s)]
*  I mean, did you think at the time, did you think at the time it's like, Hey, trade [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4225.22s)]
*  Fox because Darren felt like he, you know, of all the things that I prioritize [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4228.62s)]
*  and I've talked about it, but like, can you get your own when it matters? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4234.66s)]
*  And Darren's that guy, it's always felt like he's more that guy than Halliburton is. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4237.38s)]
*  The case for trading him was that the money was kicking in with him faster. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4242.0199999999995s)]
*  So you had the Halliburton on the, on the rookie deal versus paying more for Fox. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4245.78s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, it was, I think the Knicks were trying to get Fox there for [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4250.38s)]
*  they loved him obviously, because the Kentucky piece and what kind of Godfather [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4254.54s)]
*  deal, but I don't think they ever shot Fox. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4258.94s)]
*  And I think Halliburton was kind of being dangled just because the Fox [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4261.62s)]
*  Halliburton thing didn't work, which in retrospect is kind of crazy. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4265.34s)]
*  I actually think when you think about where the league's gone the last few years, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4270.18s)]
*  they actually could have built their own version of what Indiana has, where, you [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4274.38s)]
*  know, around like around two guards who had the ball at the time who were attacking. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4277.34s)]
*  I think the other piece though, you know, it's so funny, like Rick Carlisle [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4281.86s)]
*  felt, felt like he got old in Dallas in a lot of ways, right. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4285.58s)]
*  And then they finally moved on for him. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4288.98s)]
*  Um, where, how inventive he was, um, for a lot of his career, but it just felt [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4291.3s)]
*  like maybe the league was moving in a different direction or something was [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4297.0199999999995s)]
*  happening, but then you watch what he was able to re how he rekindled how everybody [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4301.26s)]
*  felt about him as a coach in Indiana and how, I mean, that's stuff they were doing [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4305.78s)]
*  to the Knicks and game too. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4310.0599999999995s)]
*  I was watching the, uh, the Twitter clips the next day and some people are [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4312.74s)]
*  putting some good stuff on them. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4316.42s)]
*  Watch what they do to towns. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4317.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4319.219999999999s)]
*  What, what did you like? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4319.46s)]
*  Just chaos. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4321.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, they, they had, they pushed the pace so they get a lot of one of the [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4322.66s)]
*  things that Celtics, I was watching it more from, I was driving myself crazy [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4326.0199999999995s)]
*  about those first two Celtic games, which are moving up the ladder of all time. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4329.46s)]
*  Worst losses still, still healing from those first two games. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4332.82s)]
*  The worst Celtics loss of my lifetime was 2010 game seven finals. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4336.78s)]
*  Game four 22 is up there. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4341.14s)]
*  I think when you lose a game that actually like where you could have won the title [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4342.46s)]
*  and you didn't win because that those have to be the highest, but I think the [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4346.9800000000005s)]
*  combo of those two games, it's really up there historically, like blowing two 20 [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4350.34s)]
*  point games in a row, but part of the reason they blew it and you're watching [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4356.3s)]
*  them in the end is doing they're pushing the pace. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4358.9400000000005s)]
*  They're just trying to make towns stagger around at the top of the key, not [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4361.58s)]
*  having any idea where he should be or using Robinson. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4366.099999999999s)]
*  There was one awesome play where they were in the same play with McConnell [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4369.099999999999s)]
*  twice in a row on the right side. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4372.42s)]
*  And the first time Siakam stayed in the corner and Robinson was kind of guarding [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4374.42s)]
*  him regarding the rim and then the second time Siakam snuck up and got this wide [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4378.54s)]
*  open three, if they were using all the shit the Knicks are bad at against them. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4382.179999999999s)]
*  And it's, it's, he was doing the same stuff last year. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4387.179999999999s)]
*  Like they really gate went toe to toe with Boston in that Eastern finals. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4390.78s)]
*  And that series is way closer than I think it felt. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4395.7s)]
*  It was the closest sweep I've ever watched. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4398.66s)]
*  I never felt comfortable in any of the games. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4400.7s)]
*  Um, but anyway, I just thought, I think he's figured out pace and chaos in a way [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4403.62s)]
*  that's really unusual for a league where everybody wants to know exactly what [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4411.26s)]
*  they're doing, but Boston's the worst possible example of that. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4414.74s)]
*  Let's walk it up. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4417.18s)]
*  Let's play one four. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4418.62s)]
*  Let's wait till eight seconds. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4420.26s)]
*  Come set a pick. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4421.9s)]
*  We're going to hunt this one matchup. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4422.82s)]
*  And I think the Knicks just got used to it and they're not, they can't get used [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4424.42s)]
*  to whatever Indiana is doing. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4428.820000000001s)]
*  I hate talking about this before game three, but that's what I noticed. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4429.820000000001s)]
*  I just felt like the Knicks were frazzled by Indiana. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4433.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4436.5s)]
*  I do. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4437.820000000001s)]
*  I, you know, look, you can just tell a lot based on like sub patterns too. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4438.34s)]
*  Cause in that fourth quarter there, he doesn't go back to cat until it feels [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4442.54s)]
*  like they need his offense because he didn't, I think it was, I mean, I've got [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4446.22s)]
*  somewhere here, but I mean, he was in at two 25 when it was one 10, one Oh one. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4450.22s)]
*  So at that point you figure he's coming in because they got to make up the [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4454.780000000001s)]
*  nine points somehow and they're willing to give up. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4458.54s)]
*  I mean, he was subbed out, uh, with nine minutes to go. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4461.1s)]
*  Uh, I thought the other great thing was that the Pacers won that [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4465.46s)]
*  start of the fourth quarter. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4468.740000000001s)]
*  Cause I thought in game one, they were losing the game because of how bad they [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4469.54s)]
*  were when Brunson goes out with a foul trouble and then it's a 10, oh run like [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4473.54s)]
*  that in two minutes ago, this is supposed to be. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4476.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, even would be a disappointment because Brunson is out in these [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4480.14s)]
*  minutes right now and you may have just lost this game with OJ getting a couple [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4482.9800000000005s)]
*  of buckets. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4485.900000000001s)]
*  So if Tibs is taking out cat with nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter and [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4486.3s)]
*  they're not really making up any ground. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4491.9800000000005s)]
*  And then he brings them back into two 25. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4493.620000000001s)]
*  He realizes how much of an issue cat is. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4495.5s)]
*  And I think you said something, cause sometimes it is very straightforward. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4497.740000000001s)]
*  It's let's get the switch on cat. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4501.5s)]
*  Let's see what we have. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4503.660000000001s)]
*  Let's attack. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4504.54s)]
*  But for Boston, it was always just that. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4505.660000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4508.3s)]
*  It was always just that. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4508.580000000001s)]
*  There's been a couple things and it even takes me like a second time to notice it [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4509.98s)]
*  where it's like, you think we're switching into the cat hunt here with the ball [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4514.46s)]
*  handler, but we're really doing is there's this other thing where somebody's like [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4518.219999999999s)]
*  crossing underneath it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4522.82s)]
*  And that's really what the whole play is because we've shown you this. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4524.42s)]
*  It just, I know what you're saying. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4527.34s)]
*  We're really trying to catch Mitchell Robinson asleep. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4529.139999999999s)]
*  You think we're going after cat, but we're really trying to get Mitchell Robinson [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4531.58s)]
*  to forget that somebody is about the backup behind them. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4535.34s)]
*  Or we're using the first screen. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4537.98s)]
*  The first screen doesn't really even matter. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4540.42s)]
*  So cats overplaying and he's freaked out, but actually what he has to do is make [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4542.26s)]
*  up ground and follow that his, his first primary defensive assignment is now [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4545.58s)]
*  actually setting a screen for somebody else. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4551.3s)]
*  So now you're like, well, shit, I was worried about Halliburton at first, but [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4553.3s)]
*  now I don't know if I'm supposed to take the cutter or stay with my original guy. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4556.66s)]
*  And so it was just a little bit, I don't know how many times this happens, but [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4560.26s)]
*  it's not just, Hey, high pick and roll, even though there's plenty of that. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4563.9s)]
*  I mean, Halliburton, when I was watching game two, I'm kind of like getting [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4566.46s)]
*  frustrated even with Halliburton Dancer, but Mitchell Robinson for such a long time. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4570.14s)]
*  Um, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but you're like, okay, this [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4574.1s)]
*  is, this is a little predictable and it's getting a little late and then shot clock. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4577.58s)]
*  I could totally understand being a Celtics fan and watching some of this stuff going. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4580.9400000000005s)]
*  It was all right there. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4584.74s)]
*  And when cats not the one to attack Brunson's the one to attack. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4585.9s)]
*  And why, why is that complicated? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4589.22s)]
*  Why aren't you pushing the ball? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4591.46s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4592.78s)]
*  I, one of the things Indiana is doing is. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4593.86s)]
*  Indiana is just brought Indiana's brought back the fast break, which was [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4596.5s)]
*  basketball since the entire time we started playing it is we get a rebound. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4601.14s)]
*  Go. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4605.9400000000005s)]
*  So you haven't been chilling on leaking out. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4607.3s)]
*  And, you know, I was very critical of Siakam after the first game, because I [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4610.78s)]
*  went, you know, this is kind of who I like some good numbers and, you know, in [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4614.26s)]
*  the playoffs, he hasn't shot it really well from distance the last four years [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4617.9800000000005s)]
*  of being in the playoffs and, you know, there's a marginal decline in playoff, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4622.14s)]
*  which isn't the end of the world or anything like that, but he's so big. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4625.78s)]
*  And you're like, there's no matchup for him out there. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4629.98s)]
*  There's no matchup for him. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4631.82s)]
*  I mean, is it as simple as, Hey, it's OGs on him. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4632.7s)]
*  And we know how disastrous that was for any ball hander with Celtics going at OG. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4634.86s)]
*  But the fact that they early on were like, we want to get you going. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4638.66s)]
*  And then he starts hitting everything. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4642.5s)]
*  And those were like really nice shots from Siakam to that mid post back into you, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4644.219999999999s)]
*  hit you fade away. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4648.94s)]
*  Uh, but you know, I, I wouldn't be shocked for New York matching, even though it's [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4650.9s)]
*  on the road, New York matching, you know, again, we don't know what's going [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4654.9s)]
*  to happen here tonight, but do you think there's this massive gap between these [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4657.42s)]
*  two teams? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4661.299999999999s)]
*  Cause I do. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4661.7s)]
*  I don't, I don't. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4662.099999999999s)]
*  I'd like to see more bridges. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4665.94s)]
*  I think it's interesting. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4668.299999999999s)]
*  And again, we're taping this for game three. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4670.299999999999s)]
*  I think it's interesting that all those Detroit games were so close and that [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4672.179999999999s)]
*  they were down 14 plus in the first five Knicks games and that the bigger the [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4675.5s)]
*  sample size gets, they just don't have a lot of games like, okay, see, they sucked [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4682.78s)]
*  in game three. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4687.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4688.0599999999995s)]
*  So he's had a lot of quarters and stretches and even entire games where [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4688.38s)]
*  they've just killed teams. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4692.9s)]
*  And that's what would worry me the most if I was in the next fan. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4695.0599999999995s)]
*  They're not having game six against Boston was the only time they like killed [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4697.26s)]
*  the team, right? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4702.26s)]
*  And that was a team that had poor Zingas and a borderline coma, no Tatum, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4703.219999999999s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4709.5s)]
*  I mean, we just take it 17 shots per game. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4710.66s)]
*  So maybe we have seen, I just, every time with him, I feel like he finds a way to [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4713.46s)]
*  get space into a really great look. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4719.58s)]
*  Um, and nobody can figure out that weird 45 degree angle jump shot. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4721.860000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4726.34s)]
*  He has goes in control. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4726.9400000000005s)]
*  He bends and nobody blacks it. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4729.06s)]
*  I don't know what his testing would be on. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4731.06s)]
*  I don't know if it would show up even in the three cone with him. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4732.7s)]
*  He had two plays in game two. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4735.9800000000005s)]
*  One was the fast break, like football outlet to him where he has only a foot to [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4738.099999999999s)]
*  catch it and stop to then get up and still make the layup. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4747.0599999999995s)]
*  And you're thinking like, first of all, the pass is great and it hits him and it, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4750.74s)]
*  but his feet were going to be wrong. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4754.419999999999s)]
*  And it was like, I've got to catch this and then get my feet right. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4756.459999999999s)]
*  And then still go up and finish. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4758.98s)]
*  And it was awesome. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4760.5s)]
*  And then he had another play where he comes baseline. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4761.78s)]
*  He turns and it looks like anybody else's body would just like over-rotate. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4764.5s)]
*  Because if he was trying to like pull a trick on a snowboard and he gets [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4768.54s)]
*  turned and I know there's other players that are athletic enough to do this [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4772.46s)]
*  stuff, but he gets turned where you'd think his body would keep going. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4775.02s)]
*  And then it just kind of stops in midair because he has such great body control [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4777.3s)]
*  so that he's able to get himself squared up and everything. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4781.1s)]
*  And I don't, I don't know that. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4783.1s)]
*  Look, when he's going to the side and those hard dribbles that we saw, even in [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4784.62s)]
*  the last round, when he would have that, that huge fourth quarter moment in game [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4787.74s)]
*  two, he, when he gets all that momentum going with his dribble to one side, and [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4792.18s)]
*  then he's pulling up with his length and the way he's leaning, you're just not [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4796.46s)]
*  contesting that shot. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4799.46s)]
*  So I know he's taken 17 shots a game here and I'm saying a more bridges, but I, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4800.46s)]
*  I don't like it when he gets through these stretches where it's, um, you know, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4806.18s)]
*  he's, he's just kind of stuck in the corner. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4810.66s)]
*  I think we saw probably maybe two, I said it all year. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4812.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4814.700000000001s)]
*  It was shocking to watch what he did to Derek White. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4815.46s)]
*  I thought he was just able to score at him whenever he wanted, basically. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4819.5s)]
*  Quick 2020 NBA redraft Minnesota takes Edwards again. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4822.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4827.9800000000005s)]
*  We can pencil that one in. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4828.3s)]
*  Golden state took wise men's second. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4831.46s)]
*  I just think they shouldn't do that again. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4833.9800000000005s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4836.700000000001s)]
*  I think a wise man is no longer the second pick and I think it's Albert. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4837.9400000000005s)]
*  I think they take him and they're delighted by it. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4842.5s)]
*  And then him and Steph Curry, uh, this is a quite an altering universe. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4845.9800000000005s)]
*  Charlotte had the third pick. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4850.02s)]
*  They took Lamello ball Tyrese Maxey still on the table. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4851.46s)]
*  You think they take Tyrese Maxey or Lamello ball at the third pick? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4855.78s)]
*  Uh, I think they would still take Lamello. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4860.62s)]
*  Really? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4863.46s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4865.58s)]
*  Over Tyrese Maxey. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4867.62s)]
*  I know who I would prefer, but, um, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4870.22s)]
*  well, let's say we were the conciliar is for the pick. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4875.46s)]
*  Who would we tell them to take? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4877.86s)]
*  I would tell them to take Tyrese Maxey. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4881.66s)]
*  That would be my suggestion. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4886.74s)]
*  All right. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4889.54s)]
*  We'll give them the Mellow ball. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4889.9s)]
*  So Chicago is at four. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4892.82s)]
*  They took Patrick Williams. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4896.22s)]
*  I'm not sure they're running that one back. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4897.94s)]
*  So you think they would take Maxey here? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4900.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4902.54s)]
*  All right. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4903.74s)]
*  So the Mellow Maxey are three, four in some order here. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4904.06s)]
*  If Maxey goes three, I mean, you're not going to drop Lamello. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4907.42s)]
*  No. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4910.9800000000005s)]
*  I had Lamello four. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4911.860000000001s)]
*  I had Maxey three though. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4913.66s)]
*  Cleveland's fifth. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4915.9400000000005s)]
*  They took Isaac Okoro. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4916.9800000000005s)]
*  Who'd you have for her? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4920.38s)]
*  I had somebody written down. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4921.38s)]
*  Um, well, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4925.18s)]
*  or you want me to give you the name? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4927.900000000001s)]
*  No, I think I, I might take Jaden McDaniels or Bain. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4929.42s)]
*  I have Bain. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4933.860000000001s)]
*  You'd rather have McDaniels than Bain? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4938.06s)]
*  Normally I'd rather have scoring than defense. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4939.38s)]
*  Uh, I like where this is going. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4941.5s)]
*  I do. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4943.9400000000005s)]
*  I think whatever the end of this season is for Minnesota, it feels like a win on [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4944.34s)]
*  the development part of Jaden McDaniels because he's never going to be the first [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4949.26s)]
*  or second option for this team. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4954.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4955.66s)]
*  He gets stuck in the corner a lot. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4955.900000000001s)]
*  Um, he may never really develop into a guy who daily we can run some stuff for [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4958.06s)]
*  him with the ball in his hands on the other side, but whereas like there's [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4962.9800000000005s)]
*  some players I go, that's never going to happen. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4967.54s)]
*  And it's still like unlikely for Jaden. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4969.18s)]
*  There's a lot I really like about him, even though Bain has just been a [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4972.7s)]
*  flame thrower since he stepped in the league. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4975.66s)]
*  Bain would probably be more fun for you to work out with. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4979.38s)]
*  Or it'd be, he's in the gym, in the gym a lot. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4982.78s)]
*  It seems like. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4985.98s)]
*  So he's almost Bain is I'm doing an age thing here. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4986.74s)]
*  Uh, Bain is almost 27. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4991.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4994.86s)]
*  And Jaden is, uh, he's two years younger. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4995.22s)]
*  So for the people listening, if you don't remember Bain ended up going 30, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=4999.3s)]
*  you got drafted by the Celtics and then traded. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5002.58s)]
*  And this was one of the reasons the COVID draft is so legendary because. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5005.22s)]
*  Like just look how we did the first five, number one, number 12, number 21, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5009.9400000000005s)]
*  number three and number 30 were the first five. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5015.1s)]
*  Um, Atlanta is up next. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5018.26s)]
*  Um, Atlanta is up next. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5021.0599999999995s)]
*  So it sounds like you would have McDaniels or Bain, whoever's left [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5025.299999999999s)]
*  over in this spot, which I agreed with. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5028.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5033.42s)]
*  Well, he went 28th McDaniels. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5035.339999999999s)]
*  You know what my biggest criticism of McDaniels is? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5037.9s)]
*  It has nothing to do with anything about him. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5040.46s)]
*  I think he gets no respect from the referees and I don't really understand [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5043.86s)]
*  it and I've noticed that over and over again, he gets called for. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5047.339999999999s)]
*  Um, touch fouls that I don't feel like any other elite defender gets whistled [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5051.82s)]
*  for, and I don't really fully understand why, but you can kind of feel it too. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5055.9s)]
*  Like I remember going to game two of the Lakers and you're just like, ah, they're [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5060.099999999999s)]
*  just going to foul him out of the game. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5062.82s)]
*  I can see where this is going. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5064.62s)]
*  First two OKC games. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5066.0599999999995s)]
*  I felt like the whistle was not fair with them. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5067.62s)]
*  And then in game three, all of a sudden started getting a good whistle again. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5070.139999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5073.66s)]
*  So Atlanta, Jaden McDaniels, Detroit took killing Hayes, number seven. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5074.299999999999s)]
*  I'm going to say they're not going to do that again. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5078.339999999999s)]
*  This is either Devon Vassell, Denny Abdi or Aaron Neesmith were in that range. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5081.0599999999995s)]
*  I think they're one of those three. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5086.98s)]
*  Who do you have? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5088.339999999999s)]
*  This is funny because I didn't think I'd spend my Sunday Memorial Day weekend [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5092.5s)]
*  going who says no between Denny and Vassell. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5095.78s)]
*  It's, it's an unexpected joy for you. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5098.9s)]
*  You know, people were like, you get a lot of work this weekend. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5102.0199999999995s)]
*  I was like, yeah, kind of like, you're going to have any fun. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5105.219999999999s)]
*  You're going to have any fun. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5108.099999999999s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I'm going to have fun. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5108.98s)]
*  And I was like, right when we say goodbye at the end of this pod, are you kidding? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5110.5s)]
*  I think Vassell is the pick, but I, I, I'm still kind of holding out. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5116.42s)]
*  Like, I think Denny's going to be pretty good and maybe is more, there's a little [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5121.26s)]
*  bit more to Avdia than there is Vassell, but I think the sells the more proven [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5126.780000000001s)]
*  like, Hey, come in and get buckets and score and give us spacing and, and all [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5133.14s)]
*  that kind of stuff where, I mean, Denny's just so aggressive and the rebound. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5137.54s)]
*  You know, I have this out here as well. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5141.74s)]
*  He went 11th. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5143.7s)]
*  I have Denny going to the Knicks with the next next pick. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5144.94s)]
*  He went ninth to the Western Wizards. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5147.22s)]
*  I can't believe Prichard's still on the board for years. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5148.94s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5151.58s)]
*  Then I have Neesmith going to Washington. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5153.62s)]
*  Any arguments? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5157.46s)]
*  Over a Congo? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5160.62s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just watching Aaron Neesmith with flame shooting out of his ass. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5162.62s)]
*  It's Nick series. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5166.18s)]
*  It's a recent sub bias. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5167.06s)]
*  Then the next three are a Congo quickly and Prichard with Phoenix, San [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5169.5s)]
*  Antonio and Sacramento all in the clock. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5174.62s)]
*  A Congo entered going six to Atlanta quickly went 25th and Prichard went 26th. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5176.58s)]
*  So, uh, and, and Phoenix, as we talked about, uh, famously botched this pick. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5182.900000000001s)]
*  So I'm going to say a Congo for them. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5191.3s)]
*  This is where it gets exciting. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5193.22s)]
*  I'll admit with the Congo, I always think he's better. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5194.740000000001s)]
*  No, I always think he's better. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5198.42s)]
*  I think they think he's better. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5200.38s)]
*  They finally made the change, uh, this year and maybe it's just the idea of him. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5202.34s)]
*  Or maybe they were, I don't know if they're trying to keep the, keep [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5208.38s)]
*  his value down a little, I don't, I don't know. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5213.860000000001s)]
*  I kind of like, like them. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5216.740000000001s)]
*  Me too. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5219.14s)]
*  And basically this feels like a make or break a Congo season. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5219.62s)]
*  How's that? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5224.66s)]
*  I think that's totally fair. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5225.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5227.22s)]
*  Then I have quickly gone to San Antonio and Prichard going to Sacramento. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5228.22s)]
*  And then we don't have to do anymore after that. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5232.0599999999995s)]
*  He already has the extension. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5233.98s)]
*  It was super easy number here, but he. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5235.14s)]
*  Richard. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5237.42s)]
*  Uh, no, no, no, I meant the Congo. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5238.46s)]
*  I'm still, I'm still on him because he only started 40 games. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5240.26s)]
*  He's still on the Congo. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5243.22s)]
*  He's still on the Congo. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5244.26s)]
*  He's still on the Congo. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5245.0199999999995s)]
*  He's still on the Congo. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5245.82s)]
*  He's still on the Congo. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5246.62s)]
*  He's still on the Congo. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5247.42s)]
*  He's still on the Congo. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5248.18s)]
*  He started 40 games this year, but it was very clear after never starting any games. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5249.02s)]
*  I mean, he did technically start games. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5253.18s)]
*  It feels like a Kong Wu time is on the horizon down there in Atlanta. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5255.740000000001s)]
*  Quickly or Prichard? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5261.22s)]
*  Uh, I think factor in contracts. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5264.06s)]
*  No, I honestly, with Prichard, I think he is more adaptable to what you need from him. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5265.9800000000005s)]
*  If quickly just doesn't get, you know, 16 shots against the second unit and look [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5274.98s)]
*  quickly was awesome a couple of years ago. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5279.98s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5281.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5282.299999999999s)]
*  But it was very clear. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5282.7s)]
*  It was like, Hey, it's quickly time. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5283.66s)]
*  And I think he needs that freedom to be as impactful where Prichard Prichard, man, he, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5286.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's not just the dribble pull ups. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5292.46s)]
*  It's not just the dribble drives, which he got really good at, I thought this [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5294.219999999999s)]
*  year, but it's also the catch and shoot. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5297.179999999999s)]
*  So I think he's a little bit more versatile in how you can use them as [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5299.339999999999s)]
*  an offensive player where for the most part, it's like quickly just going to go. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5303.94s)]
*  All right. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5308.62s)]
*  So we just did a top 12. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5308.86s)]
*  It's exciting. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5310.78s)]
*  And the guys where they were actually picked versus how that top 12 went. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5311.82s)]
*  Number one, number 12, 21, three, 30, 11, nine, 28, 14, six, 26 and 25. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5317.299999999999s)]
*  That is fucking nuts. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5325.86s)]
*  And we don't have out of the guys in the top eight, we only have three. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5328.34s)]
*  So it just makes you think like when we were going to spend all this time on this [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5336.1s)]
*  draft, maybe you're better off with the 13th pick than this fifth, like who the [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5339.18s)]
*  it's such a crapshoot every year. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5346.74s)]
*  And we always forget it, which is why I think the redrafts are always [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5348.22s)]
*  kind of interesting to redo. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5350.78s)]
*  This one was a crazy one though, cause of COVID. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5352.18s)]
*  Um, this was not considered a great draft by the way. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5355.1s)]
*  Also city bays healthy, who knows, you know, maybe he's in the conversation. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5357.700000000001s)]
*  Uh, but you're right. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5361.900000000001s)]
*  Like I, I'm shocked cause I do it usually around this time every year and I'll [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5364.660000000001s)]
*  probably have a segment and be a slow opening monologue night before, but the [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5368.06s)]
*  number of guys that are in the top 10 and how rare it is now, like for that person [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5373.780000000001s)]
*  to be on the team that drafted them. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5379.14s)]
*  And I mean the team that actually like has them, not the draft rights. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5381.14s)]
*  It's like 50 50 more confusing. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5384.339999999999s)]
*  How many of those guys get to their fourth year? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5386.58s)]
*  I think one stretch I did it over like a five year stretch and it was, it was [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5389.299999999999s)]
*  less than 50% of the guys in the top 10. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5392.7s)]
*  Cause we knew that was always my point of like, you know, oh cool. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5395.259999999999s)]
*  I'm trading picks in the twenties all the time. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5399.259999999999s)]
*  Like who gives a shit and history still tells you like there's a significant [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5401.42s)]
*  drop off and when you're grabbing a rotational guy that's going to make it to [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5406.259999999999s)]
*  a second contract somewhere in the twenties, that's a massive win. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5408.94s)]
*  Also speaks to your boy, Ainge too. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5412.26s)]
*  Cause you start going through this Ainge draft where it felt like Boston had a [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5414.740000000001s)]
*  Richard Rob Williams. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5418.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5420.46s)]
*  He was nailing him. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5420.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's, he's had some really good picks that like, Hey, that guy's [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5422.700000000001s)]
*  going to play like 10 years. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5426.740000000001s)]
*  So, um, yeah. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5427.620000000001s)]
*  So as I talked about the 20 stuff, which we've talked about for a really long [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5429.18s)]
*  time, teams were on this for a long time. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5432.26s)]
*  I always felt like those picks were just a little overrated, but it sounded [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5433.900000000001s)]
*  really cool to be like, Hey, this expiring better or whatever. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5436.3s)]
*  And like, you know, it depends if he's expiring and you're getting something. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5438.58s)]
*  So I'm not criticizing that transaction, but then it's like, okay. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5441.38s)]
*  So that means all the top 10 picks are really valuable. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5443.9400000000005s)]
*  And then you look at those and you go, my God, yeah, this isn't, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5446.66s)]
*  this is where the stars are. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5451.86s)]
*  So that means a chance at one of them is valuable, but the return on even the [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5453.78s)]
*  guys in the top 10, you'd be shocked and I'll do it again this year, but you'd [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5459.62s)]
*  be shocked how many times the guy is not even on the team in the fourth year of [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5462.1s)]
*  the rookie contract. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5465.5s)]
*  Also crazy. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5466.74s)]
*  How many times an awesome player falls into the 12th to 17 range? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5467.54s)]
*  Cause it happened in that 21 draft too, right? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5472.3s)]
*  Shen Gun and Trey Murphy fell to 16 and 17. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5475.06s)]
*  Halberd fell to 12. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5478.54s)]
*  Where did Booker go? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5479.98s)]
*  Like 13? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5480.7s)]
*  12 maybe? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5482.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5483.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5484.06s)]
*  Somewhere like in the 12, 13 range. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5484.22s)]
*  That's something like that. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5486.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5486.98s)]
*  Well, the problem for him was that team in Kentucky was loaded. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5487.26s)]
*  So, uh, yeah, 13th pick, good call. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5491.38s)]
*  There's always one guy in that range that nails it. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5493.78s)]
*  All right. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5496.54s)]
*  Before we go, cause we're going to go enjoy our Memorial day. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5496.82s)]
*  I asked you to, you have to give me one absolutely crazy prediction for the [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5499.9s)]
*  summer that deep down you don't think is that crazy. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5504.98s)]
*  Nets running back with Kyrie. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5511.82s)]
*  All right. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5517.42s)]
*  Make the case. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5517.7s)]
*  Let's hear it. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5518.42s)]
*  Joe, all is for doing. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5521.38s)]
*  All is forgiven. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5522.9s)]
*  Uh, that's, that's not, I, you gave me this like one minute [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5525.46s)]
*  before I jumped into the zoom. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5529.299999999999s)]
*  Um, it was like 20. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5531.099999999999s)]
*  There's not what there's not one. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5533.339999999999s)]
*  It could be like a Jalen Brown ends up in Houston kind of level. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5537.54s)]
*  I think there's going to be three major name transactions. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5543.5s)]
*  I do. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5547.94s)]
*  Cause I think one will go and then the other teams that we're working on it [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5549.139999999999s)]
*  all sees they're going to feel left out. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5552.42s)]
*  And I'd imagine one of those top five picks move. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5554.22s)]
*  Well, I think it's yeah, but it also could be maybe Utah just says we have to do [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5559.9s)]
*  something like we have to figure out a way to package this unless, you know, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5564.9800000000005s)]
*  they get done with the entire draft thing and they go, Hey, look, edge [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5568.9s)]
*  comb fell to us. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5571.06s)]
*  Uh, the Kyrie thing was kind of a joke though, because I was thinking about his [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5572.38s)]
*  negotiation and he can opt out of the 44 million this year and you're thinking, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5575.58s)]
*  okay, but what, what do I have to pay you? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5581.9s)]
*  And you're not going back to the nets. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5584.42s)]
*  Like the one team with all this cap space isn't going to the nets. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5586.82s)]
*  And now if you're Kyrie's representation, you can go, it doesn't [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5589.98s)]
*  matter what our leverage is or isn't. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5592.98s)]
*  But we said this two years ago with him and he still got that [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5595.259999999999s)]
*  awesome contract for them. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5597.62s)]
*  Remember we were like, who are they competing against? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5598.62s)]
*  Didn't matter. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5600.58s)]
*  He got the 40 million a year. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5601.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it was almost like they admitted we had to give him this because [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5602.58s)]
*  what we gave up for him and you're like, okay, you could argue it's going to be [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5606.62s)]
*  the exact same thing that he's going to get everything that he wants because of [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5611.54s)]
*  even with the number one pick and bringing in flag is like, so wait, you're [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5616.06s)]
*  going to play hardball with me now though, when you talked about this, this [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5619.7s)]
*  window and wanted to build this team around me and Anthony Davis. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5623.42s)]
*  So I was trying to be cute with it. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5627.74s)]
*  I don't actually believe that that would happen, but I don't know what Brooklyn's [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5629.34s)]
*  going to do with all of their cap space. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5632.74s)]
*  Would Detroit try to, and they might not have enough space with the way that [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5634.26s)]
*  Kate's contract goes up a little bit here, but would they just go, Hey, we'll [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5638.46s)]
*  give you the full four years to miles Turner. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5642.74s)]
*  You know, we have a stretch five to go with Duran. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5646.74s)]
*  If you want to switch this and try to take away from a team that [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5649.02s)]
*  we're tough. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5651.74s)]
*  Cause we know I was looking at him. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5652.22s)]
*  We know the center market and it's in the, it's around 20. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5653.9400000000005s)]
*  That's where these guys land and over and over again, except with [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5659.26s)]
*  the exception of sub bonus. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5662.9s)]
*  So we think it's 20, but then we know with free agents, especially when [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5665.22s)]
*  there's not a lot of them out there, all of a sudden somebody gets some crazy [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5669.38s)]
*  deal. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5673.14s)]
*  I do you think miles Turner has worked more than 20 million a year? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5673.62s)]
*  I think he is when there aren't any other good free agents out there. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5677.14s)]
*  I mean, he's still only 29 years old. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5679.58s)]
*  He just turned 29 two months ago. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5681.58s)]
*  Um, even though it felt like, again, we said this at the top, it felt like he [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5683.62s)]
*  was available there for a long time, but he was available in that way where it's [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5686.7s)]
*  like, well, we don't want to just give him away. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5689.7s)]
*  Like whatever you may think about his deficiencies, there's still a lot of [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5690.9800000000005s)]
*  really good stuff about it. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5693.94s)]
*  And now here they are two games away from the NBA finals, but he was [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5695.339999999999s)]
*  available partly because he kept getting thrown into Laker trades. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5698.78s)]
*  That seemed like they were just coming from Laker fence, you know, where they're [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5701.98s)]
*  like, oh, they're going to trade for miles Turner and buddy. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5706.54s)]
*  He'll just like, are they, I don't know. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5708.7s)]
*  Why is he doing that? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5710.82s)]
*  Like, I believe he was available for a while, but they weren't, but they [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5712.259999999999s)]
*  weren't going to give away though. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5718.379999999999s)]
*  They wanted to get a good player back for him. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5719.54s)]
*  All right. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5724.259999999999s)]
*  I'm going to give you mine. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5724.419999999999s)]
*  I didn't really give you one. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5727.66s)]
*  You, you didn't have one. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5730.46s)]
*  You didn't have one. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5732.78s)]
*  I got, you know what though? [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5734.62s)]
*  20 plus years of doing this. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5736.46s)]
*  We got a few minutes out of it anyway. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5737.62s)]
*  So thanks in advance. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5740.139999999999s)]
*  I have a good one. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5744.74s)]
*  Can we talk about Lebron going to Cleveland? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5746.54s)]
*  Sure. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5749.259999999999s)]
*  We just talk it out. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5752.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5753.54s)]
*  For sure. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5754.5s)]
*  There's a couple of ways it could go. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5759.179999999999s)]
*  It's a really interesting last act for him. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5761.339999999999s)]
*  I'll start here with what they have with their assets. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5765.139999999999s)]
*  They have with him, Luca and Reeves together Reeves. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5767.78s)]
*  I guess you could try to trade him this summer, which you'd have to with the [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5771.419999999999s)]
*  way his contract is going to go. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5775.339999999999s)]
*  But I'm not sure if you're getting a piece back, but if you put Luca and [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5777.379999999999s)]
*  Lebron and whatever that piece is together, I still don't know what [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5780.9s)]
*  that gets you if you're the Lakers. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5783.7s)]
*  And the goat stuff, which just doesn't end ever. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5787.139999999999s)]
*  And every time you think it's over, now the agents are frightened. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5790.78s)]
*  Now you have David Falk defending MJ and then Rich Paul's like, well, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5793.66s)]
*  I've got to defend Lebron. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5797.38s)]
*  Now we have the agents of the two guys involved in the goat discussion [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5798.42s)]
*  arguing about who's the goat. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5802.0599999999995s)]
*  That's how bad it's gotten. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5803.42s)]
*  How stupid it's gotten. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5804.7s)]
*  I want it to end so bad. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5806.66s)]
*  And it, like, I just thought after a certain age, honestly, with Lebron, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5809.0599999999995s)]
*  to me at this point, there's only things he could add to his legacy. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5812.5s)]
*  Playing this long. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5815.94s)]
*  I don't think there should be any result, any stat line where you're allowed to [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5817.9s)]
*  then go, well, you know, I thought you were this, but this age 41 season, I've [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5821.74s)]
*  got to reassess things. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5826.5s)]
*  You know, I didn't, Steph is kind of getting close to that. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5828.82s)]
*  Like if Steph loses in the first round, it's like, oh, this guy lost this many [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5830.86s)]
*  times in the first round or didn't get the resume is complete. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5833.86s)]
*  We've already printed it out in our printer. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5837.06s)]
*  We have it. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5839.1s)]
*  That would be a good segment where it's like, once you're past this threshold, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5839.86s)]
*  like we can't, it's like the over 38 rule, but it's legacy top where we can't, [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5844.54s)]
*  we can't take anything away from you now. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5850.34s)]
*  You know, it's like Lebron has 40,000 points, but he didn't get 42. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5852.94s)]
*  Like you're just okay. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5858.42s)]
*  He's coasting a bit against Minnesota. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5859.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5861.86s)]
*  I think the team on BA, is that good enough? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5862.26s)]
*  If you're doing game four breakdown and saying, Hey, I thought Lebron wasn't [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5864.38s)]
*  showing the initiative that he showed in game three, that's totally fair. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5869.26s)]
*  But if you're then using that as some like, Hey, Jordan will never do that. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5874.1s)]
*  Jordan will never fucking coast. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5877.42s)]
*  It's like, dude, I don't want to do this. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5878.820000000001s)]
*  It makes me actually want to talk about Angel Reese more. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5880.06s)]
*  So that doesn't happen. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5883.22s)]
*  Um, look, Angel Reese post-ups. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5885.780000000001s)]
*  I think we should have, I ran into Rich Paul recently and it was funny cause I [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5890.18s)]
*  thought he was coming over to, um, give me shit about something I said. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5894.38s)]
*  And honestly dude, he's so good. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5898.9800000000005s)]
*  He's so good with people. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5901.38s)]
*  I was like, Hey man. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5903.3s)]
*  And he was like, what's up? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5904.46s)]
*  And I was like, are you getting on my case? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5905.9400000000005s)]
*  Cause he's like, man, I don't care about any of that shit. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5908.34s)]
*  He's like, I don't know what you're talking. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5911.900000000001s)]
*  And then he started talking to me about college football. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5912.9800000000005s)]
*  He's like, I love like the stuff that you and van and how much you love college [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5915.18s)]
*  football and I was like, God, I forgot. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5921.02s)]
*  Cause I hadn't talked to him in forever. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5923.580000000001s)]
*  And I was like, I forgot like how good he is. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5924.98s)]
*  Compliments are a currency. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5927.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5929.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5929.82s)]
*  And he, but it's again, in a very genuine way, which I think is like our good [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5930.299999999999s)]
*  friend, Tim, Tim Walsh, he's like the rich Paul of my friend, Timmy Walsh. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5934.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5939.66s)]
*  Tim is interested in you. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5940.219999999999s)]
*  He's complimentary. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5943.179999999999s)]
*  He's sincere and it always is actually very genuine. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5944.42s)]
*  It's not, it's not so anyway. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5947.259999999999s)]
*  Um, I don't know that I'll have Rich Paul on to defend himself against David [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5948.98s)]
*  because I can't fucking take it anymore. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5952.78s)]
*  Every time I see a first take clip that actually like legitimately addresses it. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5956.219999999999s)]
*  They did it on Friday. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5961.58s)]
*  It was, it couldn't have been more news. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5962.86s)]
*  It was basketball news galore. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5965.98s)]
*  But guess what? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5968.82s)]
*  It gets the same reason why, like when ESPN tagged the Caitlin Clark, like they [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5970.62s)]
*  lost it was Brianna Stewart got that awful foul call. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5975.86s)]
*  Look at me, your guy. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5978.74s)]
*  And, uh, there was, there was like, the headline was like, despite [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5980.740000000001s)]
*  Caitlin Clark's efforts, Liberty, did they lose the Liberty? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5985.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5988.660000000001s)]
*  And then it was like, Oh, look what, look what they're doing. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5989.58s)]
*  It's like, no, they're not, they're not doing anything. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5992.780000000001s)]
*  They're giving you what you want because somebody is going to click on that [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5995.02s)]
*  because it led with Caitlin, despite Caitlin Clark's effort, not Hey Liberty [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=5998.780000000001s)]
*  win on controversial late free throws. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6003.9400000000005s)]
*  And it is the same thing as LeBron. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6006.820000000001s)]
*  Is that until people start going, I can't fucking take it anymore. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6010.18s)]
*  I'm not clicking on this. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6015.22s)]
*  I'm not watching the videos, but I imagine the results are still there. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6016.3s)]
*  Even though what is left, there's not only, there's no fucking bone left. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6020.42s)]
*  Forget meat on the bone. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6024.740000000001s)]
*  The bone is disintegrated, the carbon dating on this thing. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6026.02s)]
*  And I've yet to meet anybody. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6030.18s)]
*  Have you met anyone who's changed their mind? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6031.26s)]
*  And I, again, I just did five minutes on it. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6032.900000000001s)]
*  So you mean the one person was like, I was having a, is that a party on [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6034.46s)]
*  moral day weekend? [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6040.46s)]
*  I met this guy and he thought LeBron was the goat and we had a drink and I laid [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6042.14s)]
*  out the case for MJ and he changed his mind. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6047.18s)]
*  He was like, I hadn't thought of it that way. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6051.14s)]
*  I'm now on team MJ for the goat debate. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6053.780000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you right now, like if you're a guy in the TV opinion world and you [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6056.5s)]
*  already have to be like being invited to being on shows, like I can't, the college [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6060.620000000001s)]
*  kids listening right now, I'm like, I don't know if you're going to have the [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6064.14s)]
*  platform do it, that would be the move. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6066.22s)]
*  Like instead of, you know, where skip was just, he was moving all of his [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6068.94s)]
*  belongings out of LeBron storage. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6072.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6074.98s)]
*  But like, skip was moving his stuff out of LeBron storage unit and he was putting [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6075.14s)]
*  it in his aunt storage unit because he thought he was like, you know, these [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6078.34s)]
*  old timey writers think these nicknames are actually fucking funny or it's like [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6080.98s)]
*  can't man. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6085.98s)]
*  And you're like, oh, that's Ruffles McHenry in the globe in 1981. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6087.0599999999995s)]
*  Thought of that in the showers. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6092.62s)]
*  He's doing the Ray Liotta finding out the heist happens. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6093.74s)]
*  Can't man. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6096.3s)]
*  I did it. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6097.9800000000005s)]
*  The move would be for an opinion guy that's like not maybe not getting the, you [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6098.820000000001s)]
*  know, it's like, ah, I'll get another fill in shift. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6104.58s)]
*  Like I'm not even a head count. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6106.74s)]
*  The move would be July 5th show. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6108.38s)]
*  That's when you're having me. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6110.58s)]
*  Wait, so the jump is live on location and then a second, you want me to be the [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6113.58s)]
*  backup third person in the LA live studios. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6118.42s)]
*  But Greeny's not going to be on get up. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6121.34s)]
*  And I'm only out of the first half hour that happened to us on get up once. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6123.1s)]
*  It's like, who is it? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6126.54s)]
*  It's Cassidy, Rossello and who? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6127.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6129.900000000001s)]
*  And that person show up. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6130.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6131.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6132.22s)]
*  I think that'd be a win. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6134.740000000001s)]
*  I think that'd be a real lane. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6136.02s)]
*  It's like, I'm open. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6137.5s)]
*  I haven't decided. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6139.3s)]
*  No, to go on record and say after the next, because it's going to come and come up [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6140.46s)]
*  again, be like, I've been in the lab. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6146.18s)]
*  I've been doing the research. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6147.620000000001s)]
*  I'm going to lay it out. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6148.900000000001s)]
*  I've shown you the way. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6149.780000000001s)]
*  I'm going to lay it out. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6151.22s)]
*  I've changed my mind, change my mind guy. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6152.02s)]
*  I don't think he exists in TV right now. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6155.34s)]
*  Here's the, here's it's funny because we're making fun of this, but I'm also [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6160.9400000000005s)]
*  talking about a LeBron Cleveland scenario. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6166.02s)]
*  I'm just wondering if it all ends with him going back to Cleveland, by the way, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6169.02s)]
*  I'm not inventing this people. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6172.58s)]
*  This has been floating around for the last three, four weeks. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6173.9800000000005s)]
*  And people have been wondering just be after how it ended for Cleveland. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6176.3s)]
*  It's like, okay, what could they do? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6179.82s)]
*  There's a couple of different ways. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6181.94s)]
*  First of all, I'm pretty sure unless I, unless I don't think I'm wrong that they [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6183.139999999999s)]
*  could just trade Jared Allen and Deandre Hunter for LeBron James and take the [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6189.0199999999995s)]
*  second year of his deal and maybe give them a one year extension. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6193.54s)]
*  That's a trade that I, according to the trade machine, which still operates on, [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6197.78s)]
*  on, uh, on ESPN, apparently that's a trade that works. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6202.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a good question. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6207.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6209.54s)]
*  I am so nervous with the trade machine now too, because it's like stab news. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6209.74s)]
*  You just don't know. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6213.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6214.9s)]
*  You just don't know. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6215.379999999999s)]
*  It's just like, it says it. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6217.74s)]
*  I don't know if I believe it, but it's claiming this works. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6219.7s)]
*  Um, you could have the LeBron opt out and then signed for a smaller deal. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6223.299999999999s)]
*  So like they, it could just be LeBron for Jared Allen, a trade that I'm not even [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6229.9s)]
*  sure Cleveland would want to do because the bronze can be 41 years old next year, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6234.0199999999995s)]
*  but he could opt out, do a deal around like 20 million straight up trade for [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6237.900000000001s)]
*  Allen, or he could opt out of his deal and sign with them for the 12.9 mid level [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6243.66s)]
*  or he could sign with them for the minimum. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6250.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6253.42s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6253.58s)]
*  See, this is where. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6254.3s)]
*  Is there a sub? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6256.58s)]
*  Be like, I'm passing up. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6257.18s)]
*  I could have made 50 million. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6258.42s)]
*  I want to win one more title in Cleveland so badly. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6260.06s)]
*  I left that money on the table because that's how much I want to win. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6262.7s)]
*  Be nice if you would do it for the Lakers. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6268.34s)]
*  Would it be that I'm off their cap now? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6272.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6275.22s)]
*  I felt like I owed this to the Lakers. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6276.46s)]
*  I hate, I hate to do this, but yeah, you kind of like this. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6279.58s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6284.74s)]
*  But this is the problem. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6285.5s)]
*  Like whenever you and I are just bullshitting and talking about trades and [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6286.54s)]
*  like different stuff and then it's like, oh, that actually isn't allowed. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6289.26s)]
*  And then you just want to yell. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6292.1s)]
*  No, I did say, I did some check in. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6293.18s)]
*  Guy just pick one 13 to move some of the stuff around. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6295.46s)]
*  If Cleveland is over the tax, though, they're not going to have. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6300.18s)]
*  The full non-payer tax mid level, which is 14, I think this year. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6303.94s)]
*  So now we're talking like 5 million. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6308.82s)]
*  Look, if he's given up 50 million, you might be right. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6310.94s)]
*  He's probably giving up. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6314.06s)]
*  I would say one of the things that was very consistent about the way LeBron [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6318.26s)]
*  has handled the finances here is that even if it wasn't that much of a haircut, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6321.14s)]
*  because it was the sign of trade in Miami, but there was always like this position [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6327.14s)]
*  of, Hey, LeBron isn't the highest paid player in the league, isn't the highest [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6329.9800000000005s)]
*  paid players always like 97%. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6332.900000000001s)]
*  Maybe pretty much right there. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6335.18s)]
*  And then when they did this last deal, my guess is they're doing these deals [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6337.62s)]
*  the way they're doing them so that he has the flexibility to opt out and then [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6342.46s)]
*  tack on the next year with the next option. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6345.26s)]
*  And the Lakers were just, I mean, I guess the Lakers could have played hard ball [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6347.22s)]
*  with them last year, but they didn't want to do that. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6350.34s)]
*  Um, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6353.46s)]
*  Kobe famously was like, I'm going to get paid every dollar I deserve. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6355.54s)]
*  I'm I deserve until the end of my career, because I've made you guys a shit load [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6360.78s)]
*  of money and there will be no haircut. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6365.62s)]
*  Pay me. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6368.26s)]
*  Um, just fundamentally, if they were able to add LeBron and keep Garland, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6369.58s)]
*  let's say he did the minimum thing. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6376.06s)]
*  Let's say he said, fuck it. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6377.74s)]
*  Let's stack the calves. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6378.86s)]
*  And they were finishing games with Alan and Mowgli and LeBron [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6381.78s)]
*  and Mitchell and Garland. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6387.0199999999995s)]
*  It's pretty interesting. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6388.66s)]
*  And then we can least. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6389.78s)]
*  I don't think it's going to happen, but it was the craziest thing I could think [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6394.0199999999995s)]
*  of that I could also, I wouldn't be like, Oh my God, like with the Luka trade, I [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6396.82s)]
*  wouldn't be like, Oh my God, he's going back to Cleveland because we've already [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6403.179999999999s)]
*  done this with him. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6406.0599999999995s)]
*  And it would be an interesting way for his career then if he felt like he had one [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6407.46s)]
*  year left. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6410.62s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6413.42s)]
*  And again, I'm not the first person who thought of this. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6413.86s)]
*  I'm not taking credit for it. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6415.82s)]
*  What if Mitchell, what do you think Mitchell would say to his closest friend? [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6417.42s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6421.94s)]
*  This is sweet. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6423.38s)]
*  Cool. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6423.94s)]
*  The goat. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6424.139999999999s)]
*  Um, I think there's some pretty, there's some pretty interesting issues that come [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6425.22s)]
*  into play pretty quickly, right? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6432.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6435.26s)]
*  I don't, I get what you're talking about here, but I don't, I don't really know [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6435.62s)]
*  that it makes that much sense for them. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6440.42s)]
*  It feels too risky weirdly for Cleveland. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6443.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6447.38s)]
*  Who won 64 games. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6447.58s)]
*  Like the Allen and Hunter for LeBron, if you're doing that, it's partly because [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6450.62s)]
*  you're trying to maybe dump contracts in the longterm. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6454.58s)]
*  You're going to take the hit for one year with the money, but then longterm, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6457.38s)]
*  you're actually going to reset your, your cap because they can get away with some [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6460.58s)]
*  second apron stuff next year, just not the year after. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6464.22s)]
*  Um, I was trying to think, is there any other team I could see him wanting to go [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6467.38s)]
*  to that would give him a chance to win the title, the Pacers for the mid level? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6472.900000000001s)]
*  I don't think of that. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6478.1s)]
*  I don't think the Pacers would go. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6478.900000000001s)]
*  Dallas was interesting as, as one too, cause a kid and AD and, um, Cooper [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6481.1s)]
*  flags there, Kyrie's coming back. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6488.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6492.5s)]
*  That was the only other one I could think of. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6493.66s)]
*  Cause otherwise he stays with the Lakers and they trade Reeves. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6496.179999999999s)]
*  And if I was a Laker fan, I'm not sure that's the outcome I'd be hoping for. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6499.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6504.139999999999s)]
*  Like, oh cool. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6506.0199999999995s)]
*  We're gonna have to trade Reeves. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6506.58s)]
*  Although Luca, I don't know if you saw the pictures of Luca recently. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6510.299999999999s)]
*  So I don't trust pictures. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6514.299999999999s)]
*  I don't trust video clips. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6515.339999999999s)]
*  I don't trust pictures. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6517.099999999999s)]
*  Slim. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6518.0599999999995s)]
*  Looks like he had some Caesar salad wraps, some carrot juice. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6519.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6525.94s)]
*  You give me a golf weekend with my buddies and on Monday, I look [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6526.42s)]
*  like something's wrong with me. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6528.9s)]
*  That's how I'm going to feel after this three day weekend. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6531.38s)]
*  Something wrong with you. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6533.22s)]
*  Would you go out last night? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6534.22s)]
*  You were a little, you were a little choppy to start the pod today. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6535.5s)]
*  What do you mean choppy? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6539.0199999999995s)]
*  Just tired. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6540.42s)]
*  Were you tired? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6541.62s)]
*  Were you up late last night doing something in Hollywood? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6542.14s)]
*  No, I'm just old. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6545.099999999999s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6547.38s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6550.14s)]
*  I think we need to address this. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6551.26s)]
*  What's up with you with the pickleball thing? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6552.34s)]
*  You hit that guy right in the head. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6553.82s)]
*  What is it? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6556.18s)]
*  I don't play pickleball. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6557.34s)]
*  That's what I would tell a jury. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6559.78s)]
*  I've never, ever played pickleball. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZSeDb15aM&t=6562.62s)]
