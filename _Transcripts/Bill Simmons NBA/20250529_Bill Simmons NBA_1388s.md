# Can the Knicks Come Back from 3-1 and Make The Finals? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A)
*  I thought this was going to be an awesome game today and, uh, New York had other ideas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=0.0s)]
*  A couple of the Pacers had other ideas. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=4.84s)]
*  Did New York figure anything out today, Mahoney or did Indiana just suck? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=7.68s)]
*  I think they figured out how to play defense like they had something to lose. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=12.68s)]
*  You know, I think there there's games where the next defensive problems are [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=16.64s)]
*  personnel based, are schematic. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=19.96s)]
*  That's been the case in the series to some extent in this game. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=22.64s)]
*  I didn't think they changed a ton. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=24.96s)]
*  They changed some. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Mostly they just played with actual intensity, especially on the perimeter to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=27.56s)]
*  the point that it did feel like the Pacers kind of forgot for a while that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=30.96s)]
*  they were allowed to move into the direction of the basket. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=34.56s)]
*  Like it was all side to side. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=37.04s)]
*  It was all handoffs up top. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=38.4s)]
*  Once they, you know, Ben Mathurin came in and decided to cut and they decided to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=40.4s)]
*  drive a little more of the game changed a bit, but I thought the Knicks perimeter [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=43.84s)]
*  defense pressured them out of a lot of their stuff and they deserve a lot of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=47.16s)]
*  credit for that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=50.28s)]
*  What'd you think, House? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=51.2s)]
*  Um, the Knicks did the thing that's most important in basketball, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=52.84s)]
*  which is make the shots. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=56.64s)]
*  They started off by, by the making of the shots in the first quarter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=58.32s)]
*  And that had the effect of keeping the Pacers from running. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=61.68s)]
*  So we had two quarters from the Pacers where they scored less than 25 points. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=65.72s)]
*  They scored 45 points in the whole first half, 23 points, first quarter, 22 points, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=71.28s)]
*  second quarter, because the Knicks did the making of the baskets. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  Bill Simmons. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=79.0s)]
*  And Indiana stunk. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=80.68s)]
*  Not a good game for them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=82.88s)]
*  It's pretty tough when Ben Mathurin saves you from having like a 75 point game, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=85.04s)]
*  which is where we're headed. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=90.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=91.6s)]
*  And, and the stats reflect how bad it was, but it was even worse watching it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=92.64s)]
*  Niece Smith was one for eight. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=97.36s)]
*  He only played 15 minutes by the way. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=99.76s)]
*  They seemed like they were limiting him with that ankle probably. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=101.64s)]
*  And that, I mean, Jalen Brunson feasts every minute that Niece Smith isn't on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=105.04s)]
*  the floor. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=108.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=109.16s)]
*  And once they kind of realized maybe the game was a little behind them, they [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=109.8s)]
*  started a little more careful. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=114.36s)]
*  Nelmhard was three for eight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=116.84s)]
*  It felt worse. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=118.0s)]
*  Three turnovers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=119.12s)]
*  Turner. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=120.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=122.12s)]
*  24 minutes, five points, four turnovers, and a couple of like really just awkward [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=122.36s)]
*  offensive moments, 25 feet from the basket where he's like trying to dribble [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  against Mitchell Robinson. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=132.28s)]
*  Like it was one time he just kind of fell out of bounds. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=133.56s)]
*  It was like, I thought the biggest thing the Knicks did today, other than pressure [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=136.8s)]
*  Halliburton and just make it more difficult for him on defense was they felt [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=139.84s)]
*  like they were attacking Miles Turner, Rob. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=144.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=146.36s)]
*  Like, oh, you're going to have the bomb coming at you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=147.0s)]
*  Completely. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=149.2s)]
*  And he's been beating up on their smaller defenders, all series against [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=150.12s)]
*  mismatches and they were swiping really well to kind of dislodge him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=153.76s)]
*  They were fighting for position much more effectively. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=156.8s)]
*  You mentioned like on the perimeter, there's times, there's times where [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=159.28s)]
*  Miles Turner looks like a great athlete. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=162.16s)]
*  And then there's times where it looks like one of his legs is like a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=164.56s)]
*  dramatically different length than the other, and he can't quite move in any [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  kind of like fluid manner. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  Uh, they get brought that side out of him to the point that like Mitchell Robinson [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=172.04s)]
*  at some points was pressuring Miles Turner up to half court. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=175.4s)]
*  Like they just wouldn't let him move at all, much less get into that little [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=178.0s)]
*  handoff game. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=182.32s)]
*  It, the Miles Turner free agency tape is going to have to be a carefully edited [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  20 minute highlight tape house. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=188.52s)]
*  But I think the 20 minute highlight tape will be excellent. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=190.08s)]
*  It can't have anything to do with Carl Anthony towns. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think cat, um, has, has found the, the opposing center that he's most [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=195.8s)]
*  comfortable with in the entire NBA. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  And it's a version of cat, you know, that man going to the rim with, with [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=204.52s)]
*  ferocity, relentless ferocity and his, you know, making himself into a true [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=209.36s)]
*  New York Nick, you could see the crowd gets super fired up every time he went [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=214.84s)]
*  to the, to the rack and bang, turn her out of the way and, and, you know, got [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=218.76s)]
*  his and really he and Brunson set the tone in, in the first quarter with that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=223.44s)]
*  intensity that they brought and they controlled the flow of the game in the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  first quarter. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=233.16s)]
*  And it was weird that the Pacers didn't really have a, any kind of retaliation. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=234.32s)]
*  I mean, the closest we got was that 10 points with four minutes left in the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=239.48s)]
*  third quarter. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=242.6s)]
*  Um, and then they kind of got there again in the fourth quarter, but really, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=243.92s)]
*  uh, they just never got there, Mahoney. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=248.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=250.12s)]
*  But to that point with cat, it was really telling that this series for him has [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=250.36s)]
*  become not really a post-up series, not really a three point shooting series. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  It is drive past miles Turner drive past Pascal Siakam. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=258.16s)]
*  Pacers have nobody who can stay in front of him. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=261.8s)]
*  So long as cat can stay at a foul trouble and granted, you know, he had about three [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  or four dumb files in this game. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=268.32s)]
*  I think he easily could have been called for five or six, uh, you know, a shove [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=269.6s)]
*  here or there that just didn't get whistled. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  And maybe this game is very, very different, but he definitely showed up [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=274.44s)]
*  Brunson definitely showed up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=277.84s)]
*  Like those guys had to deliver. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=278.84s)]
*  And the depth also did like, honestly just might be the best Landry [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=280.96s)]
*  Shamett playoff run we've ever seen from him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=285.64s)]
*  Has there been a Langer Shamett playoff run? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=288.36s)]
*  This is the thing he tends to be. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=290.2s)]
*  He tends to be the guy who comes into the playoffs and just immediately [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=291.56s)]
*  disappears, like way too small, gets boxed out of series, two streak. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=294.36s)]
*  He a shooter to really make a difference. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=298.28s)]
*  This guy was like freezing TJ McConnell in the lane, like killed dribble on the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=300.4s)]
*  baseline, completely stalling out the Pacers offense. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=304.52s)]
*  I, the pressure that Shamett and Delon and Delon Wright have brought to the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  series, I think has been like a really meaningful thing, which is crazy to say. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=311.28s)]
*  McConnell was another one who sucked tonight. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=314.96s)]
*  Um, the really everybody in the Pacers you look through, Mather and has 23 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=317.32s)]
*  points and they scored 94 as a team. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=323.32s)]
*  That's pretty rough. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=325.88s)]
*  Um, the town's piece of it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=327.0s)]
*  I still feel like anytime a team isn't just completely attacking him on [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=330.36s)]
*  defense house, especially once he gets to four fouls, I would just go at him [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=334.04s)]
*  every play because I just feel like law of averages, he's just going to foul [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  somebody. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=342.24s)]
*  It was funny to hear Van Gundy, uh, on this three man team we had tonight. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  And we've had all through the playoffs and book conferences, just poor Kevin [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  Harlan, his usage rate is all time low. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=352.88000000000005s)]
*  He's basically like McHale bridges in those games when he has six shots in 48 [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=355.04s)]
*  minutes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=359.12s)]
*  Um, but it was funny to hear Van Gundy just openly saying like they shouldn't [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=359.96s)]
*  put towns back in. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=364.12s)]
*  He's just crazy enough to get a foul here. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=365.12s)]
*  Cause I thought the same thing, 0.6 seconds left. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  That's like just enough time for him to foul somebody on a pick. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=370.52s)]
*  Uh, but for the most part, I think the series has been a win for him house. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  An enormous win and all time when I mean, in the same way that we were observing [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=378.16s)]
*  Julius Randall, you know, kind of, uh, a rebranding for himself by the excellent [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=382.88s)]
*  performance he had for the Timberwolves, uh, in the West until recently, I know, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=388.6s)]
*  but look for the most part, like who saw that coming, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=393.48s)]
*  And you had to do some, some research. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=396.48s)]
*  You had to go back into your, uh, you know, basketball reference, Bill Simmons [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=398.68s)]
*  database to compare him to some 19 and nine. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=403.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=405.6s)]
*  And Elgin Baylor had to do that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  He made you do that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=409.0s)]
*  Julius Randall made you do that, but now he's going to make Charlotte, give him a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=409.92s)]
*  weird free agent offer and that's going to be the only one he gets. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=414.56s)]
*  Undoubtedly true. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=417.0s)]
*  But towns, uh, also, this is like a version of towns that I don't think anybody could [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=418.0s)]
*  say we've seen this from Carl Anthony towns in the playoffs. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  Like this is the Eastern conference finals for Christ sakes. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=425.88s)]
*  It's very impressive to me. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  I like how hard he's playing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=430.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=431.44s)]
*  That's a big thing for me is like, whatever the stats are going to come and go, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=431.6s)]
*  his shots are going to come and go, but he really seems like he fully gives a shit, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  which I think is, uh, and if I felt that way last year with him too, in the, uh, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=438.92s)]
*  Western finals too. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=443.04s)]
*  So we've at least gotten over that hump with them. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=443.88s)]
*  Mahoney. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=446.16s)]
*  I think he's had great responses, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=446.92s)]
*  It's like, he's been embarrassed a couple of times in this series, especially [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=448.76s)]
*  defensively, like we were just talking about played off the floor and fourth [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=451.6s)]
*  quarters taken out of the rotation for critical stretches, like Mitchell [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=454.92s)]
*  Robinson kind of taking his spot a couple of times, and then you get a huge [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=458.2s)]
*  response in crunch time. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=462.20000000000005s)]
*  Then you get this response to the Indiana win. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=463.64s)]
*  I don't know that you can ask a lot more of towns than this. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=466.72s)]
*  He's on a bad knee right now and he's still driving all that much. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=469.8s)]
*  He's still hold like relatively holding up defensively again, give or take all [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=472.92s)]
*  the fouls and credit to him too gets to kind of punch it through with that final [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=476.64s)]
*  possession before the Pacers took everybody out as like a Indiana couldn't [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  pull down a defensive rebound. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=484.64s)]
*  Josh Hart gets it rerouted to towns, pump fake drive, finish over [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=486.24s)]
*  Matheran shrug off everybody. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=489.76s)]
*  We're going home. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=491.96s)]
*  Like he deserves that kind of moment with the series. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=492.64s)]
*  He said, yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=494.96s)]
*  And the next were like dying to let the Pacers back in the game in the third [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  quarter and the Pacers weren't, but there was like a six minute stretch where it [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=499.2s)]
*  just felt like the ball was flying around off everybody. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=502.36s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=505.76000000000005s)]
*  You mentioned the towns playing with a bad knee. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=506.32000000000005s)]
*  Not sure how bad the knee was because it felt like he was doing a lot of stuff [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=509.72s)]
*  out there. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=514.0s)]
*  That's just, I had the hockey game on the smaller TV as I was watching the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=514.52s)]
*  basketball and I was just thinking how funny it is. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=518.28s)]
*  We you're on the, you're the playoff basketball getting like Carl towns, cutting [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=520.96s)]
*  it out for the sorry knee. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=525.08s)]
*  And then you go to the hockey game and guys like they have just divots in the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  side of their heads. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=530.0400000000001s)]
*  They're funny. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=531.4s)]
*  It was just broken hands or broken orbital bones. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=532.0s)]
*  It's just, it's just funny how different the sports are house and classic tips. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=534.6s)]
*  I mean, with, with his, with, with the knee, he had the most minutes of any [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=538.92s)]
*  Nick on the floor, 36 minutes, and he, uh, got the most attempts up, 20 attempts. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=542.8s)]
*  So, you know, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=548.56s)]
*  taking a shot, send him out there. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  I thought it affected his shot a little bit was the one thing I noticed it, but [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=552.12s)]
*  the barreling to the basket thing. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=555.12s)]
*  And I kind of feel like then the knee piece didn't matter, but it was [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=556.64s)]
*  in a matter of, but I don't know. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=560.6s)]
*  I've changed my opinion on that trade a hundred times since they made it, but now [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  I think Nick's won the trade. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=566.08s)]
*  That's where I've landed today. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=568.0s)]
*  After, after watching Julius Randall a couple of times, it gets okay. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=569.24s)]
*  See big one for the Knicks. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=572.12s)]
*  Can I ask you a question? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=574.4s)]
*  I, uh, I've already taken a shot of Tibbs, but I think you coached a great game. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=575.88s)]
*  I honestly think that, that, um, him getting four guys on the bench, double [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=581.16s)]
*  digit minutes, uh, at this stage of, of the playoffs. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=586.72s)]
*  I mean, we are, we, we keep exclaiming out loud. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=590.48s)]
*  We're, we're shocked by the Shamett revelation, but really the lot, right? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=593.12s)]
*  And the Shamett, um, and McBride, and I think the move of heart to the bench, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=596.32s)]
*  you still get into 34 minutes out of him. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=600.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=603.12s)]
*  Got to tip our hat to Tibbs here a little bit, Mahoney. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  Completely. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=606.52s)]
*  I like, maybe he should have been here all along. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=607.1600000000001s)]
*  Maybe they should have been playing this way. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=609.76s)]
*  You know, they, they brought in Delon, Brian, Langer, Shamett a little later in [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=611.28s)]
*  the season, but once they did, maybe those guys should have been in the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=614.0s)]
*  rotation. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=616.2s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=617.12s)]
*  We can, we can talk about that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm sure to encourage positive growth. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=618.72s)]
*  This is Tom Thibodeau and we're meeting him where he is, which is in a moment of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=621.12s)]
*  desperation, started turning to these guys and really found something with it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=624.96s)]
*  Like, I don't even think it's just a minutes thing in terms of keeping the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=628.5200000000001s)]
*  starters minutes down. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=631.96s)]
*  I think having those guys in for meaningful runs where the Knicks are [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=633.0s)]
*  winning on defense, where they're creating all this energy, where they [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=636.6400000000001s)]
*  have the momentum to me, that's taking a lot of pressure off of OG and an OB, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=639.2s)]
*  Michael Bridges, Josh Hart too. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=643.56s)]
*  You really don't even dwell or notice on the fact that like those guys can't [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=645.4799999999999s)]
*  hit threes right now, aren't really hitting a lot of shots because the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=649.52s)]
*  Knicks are winning with this defensive energy. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=652.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=654.9599999999999s)]
*  Their bench, I guess Hart, two for two for eight from three and the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=656.8399999999999s)]
*  Knicks, the Pacers seems super happy to give them as many as you want. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=665.2399999999999s)]
*  It's a weird thing for me. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=669.52s)]
*  I agree that Thibs coached a good game tonight. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=670.3599999999999s)]
*  I also think it was reprehensible that he didn't ever try to figure out how to [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=672.76s)]
*  use his bench during the season. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=676.12s)]
*  I remember doing a podcast after that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=677.5600000000001s)]
*  Nick sold the game in Boston in like February, where he's just playing the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=679.76s)]
*  guys, huge minutes in this game that ultimately they were going to be the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=683.68s)]
*  three seed or the four seed. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=686.76s)]
*  And it's like, what are you doing? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=687.88s)]
*  And I think the Knicks fans in my life, they're, they're just apoplectic that [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=689.28s)]
*  it took until this series losing game one to then now experiment with all [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=694.8s)]
*  these different lineups and lineups that really haven't played together all season. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=700.8s)]
*  But in a way better late than never, I guess, because it's definitely helped them. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=705.92s)]
*  Um, I don't know. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=710.7199999999999s)]
*  I we've, we've seen Shamett for a few seasons here. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=712.12s)]
*  I, I refuse to believe he's like a late bloomer as a playoff asset. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=714.8399999999999s)]
*  And there's been a bunch of teams that have given up on Shamett. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=718.9599999999999s)]
*  Just for the record, but he's out there. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  And again, like these lineups are lineups that I would never choose to put on the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=724.24s)]
*  floor in a must win playoff game. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=730.0s)]
*  Like lineups that should not work, that should not make sense. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=730.16s)]
*  But I think it speaks to the fact that like New York's needs right now are less for [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=733.44s)]
*  explosive offense and more for where are they getting that defensive intensity? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=737.8s)]
*  Who are the guys who are really going to pressure who are really going to play up [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=741.6s)]
*  and write and Shamett have both done that. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=744.8s)]
*  McBride always does that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=746.52s)]
*  And playing those three guys together shouldn't be a thing, but it's a thing. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=747.92s)]
*  And it's working in the series. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=751.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=753.2s)]
*  And make Indiana turn the ball over and make Albert not as comfortable, which [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=753.44s)]
*  they managed to do. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=758.4s)]
*  India had 20 turnovers tonight. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=759.2s)]
*  The Knicks were rebound out, rebounding them by 10 for most of the game. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=761.96s)]
*  And that even got a little bit. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=765.36s)]
*  Um, but I guess from the next side, they were 28% from three and they won handily. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  Good sign for them from the Pacer side. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=772.6400000000001s)]
*  They had 20 turnovers and they felt still felt like they were going to make a run, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=775.76s)]
*  even with like five minutes left with no, but literally nobody playing walks of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=778.9200000000001s)]
*  math or in, I was like, ah, I still feel like they might get going here. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=782.36s)]
*  Uh, it was a bad Halliburton game. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=785.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=787.44s)]
*  You know, a lot of smoke, including on this podcast and all the ringer [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=789.4000000000001s)]
*  podcasts about the big leap he was taking and how great he was playing. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=793.4000000000001s)]
*  And it just felt like he was flustered from the get-go with all the pressure. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=797.8000000000001s)]
*  My guess is that he'll be fine in game six. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=801.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=804.0s)]
*  I mean, and that this is one of those, I looked at the tape. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=804.32s)]
*  I can't believe how bad I was. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=807.0s)]
*  I'm going to do this, this, this, and this, and it will be a [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=808.4000000000001s)]
*  different Albert would be my guess. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=810.96s)]
*  He was the making the big leap and then he took the big shit and that happens [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=812.9200000000001s)]
*  sometimes. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=816.0400000000001s)]
*  We saw SGA, the MVP of the league and what was a game three, you know, lay a [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=817.24s)]
*  big, fat egg. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=821.16s)]
*  It happens. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  The good players. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=823.28s)]
*  When you start talking about like top 20 guys, top 15 guys, top 10 guys, once we [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=824.36s)]
*  go higher up the list, what, what separates the top five, top seven guys, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=829.52s)]
*  like you notice that one SGA game when he wasn't very good in game three, but [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=834.6800000000001s)]
*  for the most part, every single playoff game, he's been between 30 and 38 a game [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=838.84s)]
*  and consistently scoring and consistently getting his shot. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=843.6s)]
*  And you just always know you can count on him, you know, and when you go through [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=846.8s)]
*  all the best guys in the league, that's usually in place, which is why even with [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=850.28s)]
*  somebody like Edwards, people are so disappointed that, Oh, what happened to [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=853.64s)]
*  him in second half of game four? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=858.24s)]
*  And why did he seem so comfortable? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=860.08s)]
*  Because there's, he's being held to a certain standard. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=862.24s)]
*  I feel like Albert had at least was knocking on the door of that level. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=865.16s)]
*  So for him to suck tonight is just like, that's not great. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=869.72s)]
*  And now he's going to take it tomorrow on the shows. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=872.48s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of they need Tyrese Halliburton to step up. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=874.9200000000001s)]
*  He's going to be the step up guy tomorrow. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=879.1600000000001s)]
*  Who was that? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=880.84s)]
*  Who was the step up guy heading in? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=882.32s)]
*  Who was the voice you just did? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=884.08s)]
*  Is that my generic ESPN voice? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=885.48s)]
*  It was all the collage of the voices. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=887.72s)]
*  All every one. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=890.36s)]
*  I want them to have a segment called step up where they just, each of them just [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=891.6s)]
*  screams at the TV that somebody needs to step up. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=895.2s)]
*  And then at the end of the segment, they all just look at each other and they tell [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=897.5200000000001s)]
*  each other to step up. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=900.6s)]
*  Why are you stepping on our content? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=902.04s)]
*  This could easily be a ringer, hottest take style podcast, 10 minute segment, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=903.64s)]
*  anyone in the world, you know, like any world leaders. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=908.3199999999999s)]
*  Who needs to step up? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=911.76s)]
*  The new pope, anybody. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  Like Democrats need to step up. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=914.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=916.8s)]
*  Well, that definitely, I actually do need to step up. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=918.04s)]
*  But, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=921.8s)]
*  Paramount pluses main screen needs to step up because I can't find Mission Impossible. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=923.0s)]
*  Whoever's doing the UI on those things definitely needs to step up. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=929.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a disgrace. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=931.92s)]
*  Well, anyway, I think Tyrese, but long story short, Tyrese Halliburton might need [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=933.12s)]
*  to step up. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=936.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=936.8s)]
*  There is a version of a Tyrese Halliburton game where he shoots seven times and it's [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=937.36s)]
*  still awesome. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=941.12s)]
*  He's done that before plenty of times. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=942.1999999999999s)]
*  This was not that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=943.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it was, it was distressing how little he was even looking at the rim and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=944.8s)]
*  the times where even he would turn the corner on the Knicks defense. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=949.56s)]
*  And it's just like, he's, it looks like he's waiting for the breakdown to make [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=952.4s)]
*  the easy pass for the layup that frankly has been there for the last three games [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=956.36s)]
*  or so. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  But if you're that guy, if you're a top 20 guy, you are the breakdown. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=961.2s)]
*  Like that, that's your job to create that and to capitalize on it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=964.84s)]
*  And the fact that he wasn't really looking to score for, I would say at least [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=968.08s)]
*  two, maybe two and a half quarters. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=971.12s)]
*  It just wasn't enough for where the Pacers were. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=973.36s)]
*  How's, do you think it's cause Michael Imperiali was there? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=976.12s)]
*  You think he was psyched out? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  It's one thing to play in front of Chalamet, Spike Lee, some of the stars, but [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=979.8000000000001s)]
*  when Christopher's in the house, I don't know. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=984.0s)]
*  He's a different level. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=985.84s)]
*  Anything is possible. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=986.6800000000001s)]
*  You don't want Christopher going to the trunk. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=987.76s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  He is Paul. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=991.24s)]
*  Paul is dead, right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=992.5600000000001s)]
*  Paul Walnuts is dead. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=993.76s)]
*  Again, so that would have been the next move is to put court side, just all the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=995.24s)]
*  sopranos characters, the living ones just all in a row, but some of the key ones [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1000.84s)]
*  are dead, but I think it's still, I think that would be a little intimidating. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1005.76s)]
*  Maybe get all the mafia movies. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1008.1600000000001s)]
*  Can we pour one out from Miles Teller though, who was next to Timothy Chalamet [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1009.64s)]
*  couldn't even get the broadcast shout out. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1013.44s)]
*  Like he was just the normal guy sitting to the side of Timothy Chalamet. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1015.8000000000001s)]
*  That's Miles Teller. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1019.08s)]
*  It's a tough beat. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1019.88s)]
*  He's in Top Gun Maverick for God's sakes. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1020.76s)]
*  He's in Whiplash. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1023.52s)]
*  He's been in some big movies. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1024.32s)]
*  He was just in a movie that led Apple TV. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1026.2s)]
*  He should have at least gotten a Chiron. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1028.6s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1030.04s)]
*  He's at Chiron level at bare minimum. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1030.76s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1034.04s)]
*  Uh, my son was admiring Chalamet's fit. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1034.92s)]
*  He likes the Chromeheart and Nix pants. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1037.96s)]
*  We thought, uh, it was a great job. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1039.84s)]
*  He thinks, he thinks Chalamet has done a great job with the, uh, with the, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1041.44s)]
*  with the fits during the games. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1044.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1046.76s)]
*  I'm not going to bring him in later for a fit fit thing. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1047.3600000000001s)]
*  Um, Brunson, six for nine in the first quarter laid the smack down. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1050.28s)]
*  I had in the Taylor fade by my weekly prop. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1056.56s)]
*  I did over 30 and a half because I thought Brunson was going to have a big game. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1060.16s)]
*  I think he finished with like 34. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1063.68s)]
*  But one of the reasons I thought that was because I didn't think towns was [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1065.3200000000002s)]
*  going to be good in this game. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1067.44s)]
*  So whatever they got from towns, I wasn't expecting. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1068.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not positive. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1070.64s)]
*  The Pacers were expecting either, but, um, this Brunson thing, his eyes [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1071.88s)]
*  just light up on them hearts. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1076.5600000000002s)]
*  You mentioned it before, Rob. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1077.76s)]
*  It's like the Nemard Pacers and then the non-Nem. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1079.76s)]
*  I, when he sees Halliburton, it's, he looks like house passing an Arby's. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1082.2800000000002s)]
*  Hey, hey, no, that's a compliment house. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1086.3200000000002s)]
*  I know I'm not, that was an excited. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1089.76s)]
*  Oh, hey, it was, I met somebody else who loved the Arby's and I always bring [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1092.2s)]
*  you up when somebody else likes Arby's. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1098.0s)]
*  Because you're my number one person. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1101.44s)]
*  We should know it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1104.48s)]
*  I just feel like it's almost like houses apart owner and Arby's, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1105.48s)]
*  even though he owns nothing. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1108.64s)]
*  But I've invested enough. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1110.1200000000001s)]
*  Believe me. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1111.5200000000002s)]
*  Believe me. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1114.0800000000002s)]
*  Thank God for Arby's. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  Anyway, Jaylen Brunson, Rob go. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1116.44s)]
*  Come back from Arby's. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1121.48s)]
*  No, he, look, there really is only one Pacer who can guard him in this series. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1122.76s)]
*  He's currently kind of injured clearly, at least being held back to some degree. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1126.48s)]
*  I thought it was a sign of, you know, it was represented, representative of [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1130.64s)]
*  Indy's desperation that Ben Matherin was not only like the only guy who could [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1134.48s)]
*  score, but the only guy they would even trust to guard Jaylen Brunson during [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1138.0s)]
*  critical stretches of the second half. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1142.68s)]
*  Like they, they gave him that job too, because Ben like Shepard can't do it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1144.24s)]
*  Nemhard cannot do it. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1149.0s)]
*  Those guys have no impact honestly on Jaylen Brunson and they're good defenders [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1150.1200000000001s)]
*  who fight through screens and like can be very effective against any other kind of [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1154.48s)]
*  scorer, but for some reason, Jaylen Brunson can just kind of bump them off. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1158.36s)]
*  He can shoot right over the top of Nemhard. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1161.6799999999998s)]
*  They don't bother him at all. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1163.7199999999998s)]
*  And so if we are watching which injuries are real and which ones are exaggerated, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1164.6399999999999s)]
*  Carl Thinney Towns, you know, clearly good enough to drive and still be a [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1169.24s)]
*  dominant player in this game. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1172.04s)]
*  Aaron Eastman has to be a fully operational member of the Pacers rotation. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1173.52s)]
*  If they're going to slow down Jaylen Brunson at all. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1177.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, the recipe for the Knicks to come back from three one house, if you're [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1179.6799999999998s)]
*  doing the 2004 Red Sox, don't let us get one. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1183.72s)]
*  Don't let us get to whatever Kevin Miller said. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1187.72s)]
*  Um, it's easier to do it when you have five and seven at home. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1190.3600000000001s)]
*  You win five, you have to go on the road and take six. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1194.4s)]
*  But when the Celtics tried to do this last round, no Jason Tatum, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1198.8400000000001s)]
*  zombie porzingis Sam Hauser and a sprained ankle and the Knicks played the [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1202.92s)]
*  best game they've had and were completely healthy. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1207.68s)]
*  This, uh, this Pacer situation, knee Smith, not healthy. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1210.6000000000001s)]
*  Turner and Nemhard coming off terrible games, Pacers bench, not doing that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1215.28s)]
*  Well, how burn coming off a bad game and weirdly some pressure for a team up three, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1218.92s)]
*  two. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1225.04s)]
*  Um, what do you think the line is for the series now house? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1226.64s)]
*  Don't look. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1230.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, this is a great question. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1232.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1233.96s)]
*  Uh, the Pacers are definitely still favored. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1234.44s)]
*  Let me think about this. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh, plus for the, for the Knicks, the Pacers are favored minus two 20. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1238.88s)]
*  Rob, I can't remember if you know how to do ads. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1249.4s)]
*  I'll let you have a guess if you want. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1251.56s)]
*  I'm going to say they're more than that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1252.96s)]
*  I think it's probably more of like a minus five or 600. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1254.32s)]
*  Look at the big balls on Brad. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1260.36s)]
*  Um, minus, minus three 70 for the Pacers. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1262.92s)]
*  We are right in between the two of us. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1267.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, the Knicks were minus five today, which I jumped out of me immediately [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1269.4s)]
*  because I thought it was going to be like a minus two. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1272.7600000000002s)]
*  So Vegas, obviously in Fandel and everybody else probably liked some of the [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1274.68s)]
*  metrics that were going. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1279.5600000000002s)]
*  Um, I do think they saved knee Smith a little bit. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1280.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1284.16s)]
*  This is one of those you feel it out. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1284.7600000000002s)]
*  Oh, I didn't realize miles Turner was going to be hot in this game. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1287.24s)]
*  Ooh, I didn't realize Walker was going to make three threes. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1291.1200000000001s)]
*  Um, but none of those things were happening in Carlisle was like, all right, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1294.32s)]
*  I'll save my guy for a, for Saturday night. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1298.6399999999999s)]
*  Fandel has been your buddy for the NBA playoffs and they still have the [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1301.32s)]

*  So Pacers Knicks game six. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1324.6s)]
*  If you think the Pacers are going to bounce back and close it out against [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1327.0s)]
*  the Knicks this weekend, throw together a little same gamer. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTaw6NKG7A&t=1331.36s)]
