# Should the 76ers Be the Favorites in the League? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_llRUk0qhLs)
*  Are we sure that this isn't the year of the Philadelphia 76ers? Oh, I had that one, too
*  We sure I
*  had
*  Where is it? I had are we sure Philly shouldn't be the favorite?
*  League whoa yeah even stronger like cuz I'm Fando the Celtics are the favorite and
*  And I'm like the nets are right there
*  well, I think part of it has to do with where they set the odds and they want people to bet on it, but
*  Look nobody is gonna be more suspicious of a James Harden led team than your friend Bill Simmons. I
*  Like everything they did even the PJ Tucker contract which was too long and by year three that's gonna be whatever
*  It's a one-year deal. That's gonna be three years, but he makes your team was proof
*  You have him on your team you you guys on the team can no longer get away with things
*  And I do feel like for the hardened evolution. He's gonna be important
*  I also like hardened did look like he was in shape right you watch that what did you think?
*  Did or did not at the end of last year and now no right now when he gave that press conference and the whole thing
*  Like I was actually a believer that he's in shape
*  Sure, I mean
*  That's great. I hope he's in shape. It's his job to be in shape
*  We'll see if he's in shape, but by the end of the year, but yeah, he looked he looked good
*  You know he looked good
*  I actually thought he had some playoff games where he looked I think the old James Harden is dead
*  And we all need to get over it Houston Harden get get by anybody like that's not coming back
*  Even if the hamstrings okay, but he had some games in the playoffs where he looked like he could still do enough
*  Do enough to at least get get inside get inside shoulder position do enough to get to the rim
*  He just needs to do do his slogan for the year should just be do enough
*  Do it like when it's elimination game time when it's 2-2 game 5 the whole season is at stake
*  I don't I don't expect 30 and 12. I don't expect step back there used to be ranches
*  Just do enough to help a little bit. That's all
*  23 8 & 7 yeah great in your sight
*  1812 and I didn't just sort of stand around as the game unfolded around me as if I were plotting
*  What my postgame plans and where where I was gonna go on my first vacation
*  Just just just that because he's still pretty damn good
*  I think he's gonna be an all-star this year and in the conversation for third team all-nba and the talent around him is
*  Is this is I think this is the best team top to bottom of the Joel Embiid era the only one that's cool
*  Yeah, is that is the Butler one and I went through that last week six seven and eight in
*  Postseason minutes on that team are Mike Scott James Ennis and Boban like that's sick
*  That's your next three guys this this is team is loaded
*  Couldn't agree more I
*  Also, I never sold my my table stock last year
*  It cratered it was like Bitcoin and I watched the market crash and I watched it and I was like, you know what?
*  I'm holding on I still believe in guys who can be elite defenders and might learn how to shoot three
*  There's been some good Bible buzz at some point. I'll figure out if it's Tybal or Thibault
*  I just call them both I alternate depending on what kind of mood I'm in
*  and
*  We both really like Melton Melton's to me. It's like
*  You we look at it the same way in a lot of respects. I just like give me playoff series guys
*  Can you play in a playoff series?
*  I come out every playoffs and and I look at my own team and some of the others and it's like could you have played
*  In that series Melton's a playoff series guy
*  I still feel like Tybal's a playoff guy and then we know PJ Tucker is and the thing with PJ Tucker, especially
*  Against the Celtics is he's gonna do all the PJ Tucker stuff
*  he's gonna do all the stuff he did the Miami series and
*  Honestly other than Butler has been even played with a guy like that the guy who's tougher than him
*  It's really just Butler and and they've missed that kind of that kind of personality now whether Melton's a playoff guy is is
*  Up for debate because he kind of fell out of the out of the rotation for part
*  I'm just saying what what he what he brings to the table is stuff
*  I want to play off sirs. Well, I can I can swear on this podcast freely
*  And so yes when I talk about what Melton brings to the Sixers
*  I have to talk around it what he brings to this team is a
*  Fuck shit up guy and they need a fuck shit up guy because they can be like slow and sluggy
*  Which is not even a word they just need like he comes in there and he gets rebounds and he flies around and he gets
*  Steals this is like a really bad rebounding team outside of Embiid Tucker will do the same thing offense
*  He's a sneaky good offensive rematch goes in there and trucks guys on the baseline
*  They needed a fuck shit up guy and Melton Melton brings that dimension in the open court on the glass
*  Yeah, look, I mean the case against the Sixers is
*  Hell one and this thing and beads always injured which is like there but they're always like he gets elbowed in the like
*  What am I supposed to do about him getting elbow in the face? That's not anything to me
*  Harden crapping the bed when it matters
*  Well, we know well
*  I'm just factoring that in and I still think you could say they're the favorites even when we're factoring in the James Harden crappy
*  Playoff games and then Harden and maxi being two defensive liabilities in their crunch time five, which I just think I
*  Think you can you can plot around that?
*  In a lot of different ways
*  But I disagree with like there's Harden crappy playoff games
*  And then there's Harden took two shots in the second half of elimination game if that guy comes if that guy shows up
*  They can never win the title. They need him to be good enough
*  Their talent isn't that overwhelming that he can just no show big games. He has to show something
*  Maxi I
*  Would expect he's at least what five percent better ten percent better than his last year was good last year
*  But his year three he'll be a little bit better at least
