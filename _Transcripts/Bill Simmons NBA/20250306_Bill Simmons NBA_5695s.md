*  times of the year. We always wait for the perfect week of the season. Far enough away from the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=54.56s)]
*  playoffs right after the trade deadline. Guys start getting sidelines, scratched, bodies start [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  breaking down. Perfect time to do this. And we have a couple of doozies at the top. House, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=66.0s)]
*  just thinking back this decade, who was your favorite worst contract of the decade before [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=72.72s)]
*  the guys this year? It was probably the Ben Simmons, right? Oh, no, no, no. When he had all that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=76.88s)]
*  money left, that was he number one or something else? No, no, no, no, no. Nobody will ever rival [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=80.56s)]
*  Bradley Beal. We really should change the name of this. Bradley Beal has a no trade clause. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=85.52s)]
*  Like the impact of the Bradley Beal contract on the face of the league over the last, you know, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  seven or eight years. Just unbelievable. Mind blowing, dearly. It was unbelievable to you as [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=98.64s)]
*  it was happening and the no trade pushed it over the top. Is there anybody else you would put was? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=104.08s)]
*  Would you put Simmons above that or no? Oh, Ben Simmons, Bradley Beal. I think those are the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=107.92s)]
*  creme de la creme, specifically because Ben Simmons got a max contract and then never played. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=115.76s)]
*  Right. And when he did play, he didn't want to take layups. So, yeah, those two are the ones [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=121.76s)]
*  that immediately come to mind. Obviously, there are legacy deals like John Wall out there. Like, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=127.04s)]
*  there's a few other doozies, but. Oh, yeah, there was the Westbrook one. I forgot. Yeah, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=132.08s)]
*  we had that Wall Westbrook trade combo. Simmons was five years for 177 and I think [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=137.12s)]
*  the last four was just complete regret by everybody who had them. So we should mention, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=144.72s)]
*  you know, we've been trying to stay positive on the pods with our Ringer NBA coverage. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  This is a decidedly negative podcast, but we have fun. Hey, there's great contracts, great trades, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=156.72s)]
*  great teams. The storylines are awesome right now. How sweet. We haven't talked on the pod. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=162.96s)]
*  We have the Warriors and Lakers as legitimate contenders all of a sudden. It's unbelievable. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=167.12s)]
*  Wonderful. The league feels like it's been supercharged over the last couple of weeks. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=172.32s)]
*  We were like worried. Oh, my God, this is just going to be Cleveland, Boston, OKC and literally [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=177.12s)]
*  nobody else. And now all of a sudden, Denver's in there, the Lakers, the Warriors, the Knicks are [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  kind of lingering a little bit, but was super fun NBA season all of a sudden. Yeah. I mean, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=188.08s)]
*  I think the Luka trade definitely took this thing into a whole different gear. Obviously, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=195.52s)]
*  we spent a lot of time talking about what happened, why it happened, how it happened. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  But the actual basketball, to watch Luka kind of just pretty much automatically be embraced by the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=207.68s)]
*  crowd at Crypto. Yeah. Where he is just playing to the crowd and just straight up he's in it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=214.24s)]
*  And it's kind of amazing that it's come together in nine freaking games this way. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=220.24s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's even more amazing that some people were saying, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=225.36s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know how those guys are going to play together. Two ball dominant guys. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=229.12s)]
*  It's like, what? Two of the highest IQ guys we've had in the last 30 years on a basketball court. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=232.88s)]
*  I'm pretty sure they'll figure it out. It's been really fun to watch. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  I wanted to drop the first F-bomb of the, I mean, he's a force fucking multiplier. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=242.72s)]
*  Like that dude, because of his basketball brain and you put the two biggest basketball brains [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=247.2s)]
*  on the planet together. Yeah. I think they're going to figure it out. But think about where we [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=253.04s)]
*  were in the first third of the season, the criticism levied against the NBA. It was proper [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=258.16s)]
*  criticism. Are we really going to do this goddamn retirement tour thing with LeBron and Steph Curry [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=265.44s)]
*  and Kevin Durant? We have to watch all these shitty games with these shitty teams. And now [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=271.6s)]
*  look where we are. Look where we are. So on the one hand. Yeah. We have a Celtic Laker game [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=275.76000000000005s)]
*  Saturday night. That's, you know, other thing that first Cleveland OKC game is probably the most [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=281.44s)]
*  fascinating game in the season. And it's two guys that the Celtics have real history with, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=286.32000000000005s)]
*  They played Luke in the finals last year and then LeBron has been their biggest foil of the 21st [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=291.36s)]
*  century, both on the same team. They're so weird to watch just as a team now. They have no center. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=296.0s)]
*  They had no point guard. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jackson Hayes dropped 20 points in the first half. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=303.28s)]
*  I had long arm Jackson. But you watch them and you're like, I don't know why this is working, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=307.44s)]
*  but it's working. And this is a team I would not want to see in a series when everything slows down [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=313.2s)]
*  and you have to play the same team every time for two weeks. And I just don't want to see these guys [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=317.6s)]
*  under any circumstances. And LeBron looks rejuvenated. And by the way, LeBron started to look rejuvenated [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=323.12s)]
*  two weeks before this trade. I'm just flagging that. I'm just flagging that. Hopping a step [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=328.48s)]
*  for about two weeks earlier. You say the same thing about Steph. As soon as they [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=335.52s)]
*  acquired Jimmy Curry, he dropped a 56 on us. Like hey, very fast. Did you say Jimmy Curry? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=340.24s)]
*  You've already had your first malapropism of the pod. I did say it. Yeah, Jimmy Butler. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=347.12s)]
*  Whatever. That's the new duo, though. But no, LeBron seems to have a pep in a step. He had a [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=351.2s)]
*  chase down block the other day where I'm just like, this guy's now back to chase down blocking people. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=357.52s)]
*  I loved it. They've smartly decided that no, Luca Donchich is the point guard. The orchestrator [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=362.88s)]
*  will just work around, I don't know, one of the three best players in the NBA. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=368.72s)]
*  And they've been rewarded for that. And the JJ Reddick stuff is absolutely working. Every time [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=373.2s)]
*  the Lakers social media account posts one of his post game speeches, I know it's bullshit, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=379.36s)]
*  but I'm bought in. I'm ready to run through a wall for this guy. It's amazing to watch [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  what the Lakers have been doing. Yeah, it's very Dan Campbell Lyons-ish, those speeches he does. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=388.8s)]
*  And you know, it's a little stuff with him, like the pulling back Dalton Connect, right? Guy gets [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=395.2s)]
*  traded out of nowhere, goes to Charlotte, meets everybody on Charlotte. Trade gets rescinded. It's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  like, ooh, hey man, good to see you again. How have you been? Boy, this is awkward. And yet he's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=408.32s)]
*  inspiring him. It's not like he's a huge part of the team, but he's one of their best nine guys. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  They kind of need him. I've been fascinated watching, and I've talked about this in the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=422.56s)]
*  pod before, but watching LeBron, just like his fucking Terminator brain, recalculating how he [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=426.96s)]
*  should be used with Luca having the ball this much. And I think he immediately embraced, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=432.64s)]
*  I don't need to actually use as much energy as I used to. This is actually really good for me. Now [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm picking my spots in short bursts. It's very similar to that first Miami season when Wade was [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  awesome. And he didn't know how to pick his spots that year, especially as we got in the playoffs. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  So now, he's such a good three point shooter. He wasn't in 2011, now he is. But then he's also [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=453.76s)]
*  figured out the defense rebounding. It's a really great team to watch right now. And I'll say this, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=460.88s)]
*  I know a lot of Laker fans as this was, I can't even describe how euphoric they are. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=465.36s)]
*  They went from like, this is a wrap. I don't like watching this team. I can't take another AD up and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=472.48s)]
*  down. He's hurt. He wants to play the four. LeBron's padding his stats. He's not playing defense. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=480.48s)]
*  This sucks. We're fucked for the decade. In a flip, it's like they inherited money from some [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=486.72s)]
*  aunt they never knew. It's like, my aunt just gave me $10 million. I hadn't seen her in 12 years. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=494.08s)]
*  That's the attitude. They're going absolutely crazy house and I might have to move. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=500.08s)]
*  They deserve to be going crazy. That is the only rational response in the face of the most [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=507.04s)]
*  extraordinary, irrational trade in the history, maybe of professional sports. I mean, I guess the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=513.36s)]
*  Deshaun Watson thing might rival it. No, it's at least basketball. I think it's the craziest, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=519.6s)]
*  most indefensible trade we've had in basketball. All of sports. All of sports. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=524.48s)]
*  We said this when the trade happened, and I know I said this on this pod. This is the greatest [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=529.92s)]
*  thing you ever did for Luka Doncic. We talked about this once when we did the trade deadline [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=533.92s)]
*  a week after. It's like, well, yeah, maybe you were worried about some stuff, but you just did him the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=539.6s)]
*  greatest favor you could have ever done. You lit a fire in him. It's a kick in the ass. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=544.48s)]
*  Yes. Now he's going to have a comeback. That's the other thing with LA is LA loves comeback stories. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=548.08s)]
*  LA loves, oh, Ben Affleck. He's made gone baby gone. He's back. He looked like he had it rock [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=553.84s)]
*  bottom. Now he's putting his career back together. This Luka's as great as he is, but he was a little [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=561.2s)]
*  bit of a comeback story. It's going to be fun to watch him get in better shape, embrace vegan food, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=567.44s)]
*  embrace smoothies, embrace the Versa Climber, all this stuff. Vitamin D. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=574.24s)]
*  He's going to be getting a Halle Bieber from Erdogan. Is that what we're saying? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=582.08s)]
*  He needs a celebrity relationship soon. He's going to be playing all the hits. It's going to be great. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  I fellas, I don't want to see this team in a playoff series if I'm basically anybody. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=592.96s)]
*  And I'm sure there's going to be ways as we keep watching them that you can solve [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=598.64s)]
*  some of their deficiencies. But right now it's just, if you have two guys who are putting up [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=602.88s)]
*  60 points a game, that's, I just don't want to see a team like that. So that story has been great. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=607.28s)]
*  And then Golden State. Oh, excellent. The Jimmy thing is excellent. Can we officially say that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=612.08s)]
*  worked out way better for them than getting KD? Because when we did the trade deadline, we were [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=617.04s)]
*  like, I don't know, what are we getting from Jimmy? And we were all bullish on the Jimmy part. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=621.36s)]
*  But I think now that we've watched it, the fact that he can give them this two way defense stuff [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=626.24s)]
*  doesn't really necessarily need the ball. You don't get all of the up and down personality stuff that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  sadly KD brings to the table from time to time. We saw it the other night on TV. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=638.4s)]
*  Was, would you? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait though. Like Jimmy in Miami didn't [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=643.12s)]
*  cover himself in glory in terms of. I'm just talking this season house. Happy Jimmy. We've [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=648.16s)]
*  seen Jimmy's teeth this season. He was bitch Jimmy for 45 to 60 days. Like you really want to say [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=654.16s)]
*  from an, if you're comparing the emotional kind of component of it, I'm not sure that I'm willing [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  to concede. I think KD, if he had been into it, would have arrived with the very best attitude. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=666.48s)]
*  But I don't know if he was into it. I do. Wasn't into it. And here's the other thing about KD. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=672.24s)]
*  He didn't want to go to Golden State house. If he did want to is what I'm saying. If it had been [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=675.92s)]
*  in his brain that that was where he wanted to land. If my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle. I mean, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=680.64s)]
*  he didn't want to go to Golden State. This is why I disagree with you, House, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  is when's the last time KD was happy somewhere? 2016 Golden State. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  17. Yeah. 16, 17 Golden State. That was the last full happy season. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=695.12s)]
*  So the guy's just been perpetually unhappy. Like everybody remembers that last year in Golden State, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  people think this Booden-Holzer thing is out of left field. It's like, go look at the last year [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  in Golden State. This guy was miserable. A lot of people described it as morose for an entire season [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=710.4s)]
*  for the best team in the league by far. Obviously the Brooklyn thing blew up. And look, I've kind [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=717.12s)]
*  of defended what Jimmy did because it's just like, look, you guys don't want to pay me. After I've [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  basically overachieved my entire tenure here, I'm blowing this thing up. It was ugly, but he got [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=728.16s)]
*  the right outcome for himself in his career. He got his money in Golden State and now he's on a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=734.4s)]
*  team that I think is as scary as anyone. And it's specifically because they got Jimmy Butler. The [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=739.1999999999999s)]
*  defense has taken another step and Jimmy has just seamlessly fit into the offense, which I kind of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  thought would be the case because he played in a similar offense in Miami around, you know, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=750.56s)]
*  Tyler Hero and Duncan Robinson getting free on the three point line. Now it's Steph Curry. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=755.12s)]
*  Right. It's crazy. Well, the other thing, it's so funny with basketball, you can just add one guy [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=760.4s)]
*  and the entire team slides into place, right? Like now Moody is kind of doing a Wiggins impersonation [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=765.76s)]
*  defensively. And he was really good the other night in that Knicks game. Pods, who had the ball too [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=772.0799999999999s)]
*  much and they were almost using him as like a second playmaker because they didn't really have [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  another choice. Now he just is who he is, which is a guy on the side who can hit some threes and [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=784.4s)]
*  rebound and play hard. And then Draymond doesn't have to worry about anything at all other than [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=788.8s)]
*  throw an entry passes to Jimmy or setting screens for Steph. And you feel, Rosselle and I talked [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=793.04s)]
*  about it Sunday. It's like, you can see it's, it's like a different human being Steph now. Steph had [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=798.64s)]
*  weight of the world on his shoulders. Just looked like he'd played nine games in 10 nights every [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=804.4799999999999s)]
*  night. And now he's skipping around that with the way he played in MSG and his little tweaked ankle [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=810.4s)]
*  and he's just dancing and prancing the whole day, which was awesome. So, you know, it's funny [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=816.56s)]
*  cause we talked, I don't know how many months ago about how this league was a prisoner of the LeBron [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=822.0799999999999s)]
*  Steph era and they couldn't move on and create these new stars. So now ironically they might get [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  these two. The thing to watch for me is can go and stay getting to the four or five. Can they get OKC [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=833.28s)]
*  in round two? Cause I want to get them earlier than later. And I think avoid that Lakers Denver [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=840.48s)]
*  combo. Let those guys beat the hell out of each other. And cause those are, those are going to be [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=848.0s)]
*  tough matchups for them. But if they can play OKC, I know OKC is excellent and they're a really good [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  young team and they're having a great season, but Golden State OKC, they've already had awesome [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=858.4s)]
*  games. That's the team that I think Golden State feels like we can play with this team. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=864.16s)]
*  And I just feel like if we end up, we could have a round two where we could have Celtics Knicks. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=870.64s)]
*  We could have Lakers Denver and we could have Golden State OKC. Those would be three of the [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=878.08s)]
*  four series. And I don't even know who the other. Super realistic. Yeah. And then it would be [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=884.0s)]
*  Cleveland against somebody crappy. Before we get to where it's kind of, I'm sorry, it may be a [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=888.5600000000001s)]
*  tangent, but am I the only one who thinks Cleveland is clearly the favorite right now? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=893.36s)]
*  You are one hundred thousand fifty million percent the only one. OK, I, I, and I'm not buying this [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=897.76s)]
*  reverse jinx crap. I'm not reverse jinxing anything. I don't, I'm not doing that. I was [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=903.76s)]
*  going to sniff this out. Get them. We knew you were going to do this reverse jinx. Look, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=908.72s)]
*  the Celtics went out to a 25 to three lead. I think that's for a reason. I think they are just [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=914.16s)]
*  a nightmare matchup for Cleveland because they get Cleveland out of their base offense, which is [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=919.0400000000001s)]
*  ball movement, quick hitting, all of that stuff. The Celtics being so switch heavy, it's just like, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=926.24s)]
*  no, like Garland, you got to beat somebody. You know, Donovan Mitchell, you got to prove that [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  you're an all NBA caliber shot creator finisher. You got to beat somebody. You know, it's going to [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=935.52s)]
*  be Drew Holliday. It's going to be Tatum. It's going to be Brown. Like they're going to force [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=940.88s)]
*  these guys to play in the one on one. And I think they're going to be fine. Like, honestly, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=944.9599999999999s)]
*  it all depends on the health of the Celtics when those two teams get together. Yes. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  It will be it. That's the most important thing for that matchup. Two things health. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=955.04s)]
*  I thought the Philly Super Bowl really fucked me up as well. You didn't have me on to help steer you. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=960.0s)]
*  So no one to blame. You were in New Orleans eating fried oysters. I could have jumped on the phone. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=966.64s)]
*  No, I've had a lot of regrets and I've spent a lot of time thinking about what went wrong [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=975.92s)]
*  with the, with my Super Bowl pick. Cause my instincts are telling me Philly. I've talked [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  about this, but I do wonder sometimes of hunger is the most underrated [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=983.84s)]
*  noun in sports. And that's what worries me about Cleveland versus Boston. As Boston plays hard, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=990.24s)]
*  Tatum plays hard every night. The team gives a shit, but Cleveland hasn't been there before. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=996.1600000000001s)]
*  And every guy in that team, when they play the Celtics, it will be the most important two weeks [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1001.52s)]
*  of their life. And the Celtics can't say the same. And there's that little edge of like game seven [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1006.32s)]
*  at home, Donovan Mitchell with like, holy shit, I could actually make the finals. This is, this is [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1011.68s)]
*  my moment right now. The Celtics had that last year going back to back is really hard. The history [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1018.9599999999999s)]
*  of the NBA is like, this is the single hardest thing you can do in the NBA is win the second time [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1025.2s)]
*  in a row. And that's what worries me that the health, what am I getting from Porzingis? What [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1029.36s)]
*  am I getting from holiday? And then this Cleveland team that just can play everybody 30 minutes a [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1033.9199999999998s)]
*  game or less, they have incredible depth. They have a bench, they have a huge lead. They're going [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1038.16s)]
*  to play somebody absolutely shitty in round one, right? Like truly shitty. Whoever that eight, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1043.44s)]
*  nine, that is going to be a shit team. They're going to get a sweep in that. And they're just [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1051.2s)]
*  going to be fresh in round two. And that, you know, that's, that's a real thing. So those are my [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1055.92s)]
*  concerns. Who would be the four seed in the East? I'm blanking. That would be Indiana, Milwaukee, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1061.3600000000001s)]
*  Indiana. So I mean, Milwaukee is playing better in Indiana. Detroit's making a push by the way. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1066.88s)]
*  Let's not rule out Detroit. Oh, they had a tough loss last night. Why's this guy Schroeder has been [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  really good as the Pistons. That was a sneaky trade. I don't know why Miami didn't want him, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1079.6000000000001s)]
*  especially when Terry Roger has died as we're going to cover in the draft. He's an on-ball [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1083.68s)]
*  menace. He plays his ass off on defense. Like this guy really tries. He takes his matchup personal [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  every single night. Obviously he's a yapper and gets under the skin of every single one of his [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1094.32s)]
*  opponents. Sometimes he's on teammates too, but that's neither here nor there. I just, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1100.48s)]
*  I just think he's a gamer, man. And every now and again, he'll get you some buckets, blow by guys, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  driving kit guy. He'll make his threes every night. Like I've always been a Schroeder guy. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1110.8799999999999s)]
*  They played him. He came off the bench yesterday. Hardeman went nuts yesterday [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1115.6799999999998s)]
*  and Schroeder kind of took him in the fourth quarter. I was just doing a whole bunch of [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1120.64s)]
*  German Schroeder things on him and just defending him full court and annoying him and [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1124.48s)]
*  hard. It was getting badder and badder. I think that Detroit team, that Detroit Knicks series is [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1129.6s)]
*  going to be an absolute bitch for the Knicks. And I can't wait because they are going to be [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1135.44s)]
*  trying to get in the fights, try, you know, shoving matches, get chippy. They're going to try to work [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1140.16s)]
*  on towns. They're going to try to hit Brunson. They have, Waz, where do you, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1145.92s)]
*  we still had, I talked about this Sunday, Ron Holland, who's I think averaging an altercation [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1150.8000000000002s)]
*  every 10 minutes. Is he on your radar yet? Yeah. He's a little Ron or a testy. He's on my radar. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1155.76s)]
*  Obviously freaking Stuart, beef stew. Like that guy's pretty much ready to rumble. No matter who [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1163.28s)]
*  the opponent is. The guy almost murdered LeBron James two years ago. But yeah, Ron Holland is [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1170.8s)]
*  fun. I like that they have him in afraid to throw him on the deep end, man, and let him sort of [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1176.8s)]
*  figure it out. I think coming into last year's draft, people saw him as like kind of the most, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, sort of physically, athletically gifted of the bunch, if not, you know, the most skilled [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1187.68s)]
*  and crafty. But I like what I've seen from him so far. I think he's coaching these guys up. I [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1193.6s)]
*  really do. Yeah, I agree. I like how feisty they are. Feisty team. Okay. We're going to take a break [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1199.84s)]
*  and then we're going to do the worst contracts draft. How, so are you playing FanDuel 30 on 30? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1207.1999999999998s)]

*  It's either four or five. Might be the fifth one. And the rules are as follows. We go, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1322.48s)]
*  we go in a, not snake fashion. We just go in a circle. I'll read the, you have to say the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1329.76s)]

*  NBA trade value. The worst contract in the league, the one you wouldn't want the most, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1341.68s)]
*  the most untradable contract, the one that if you were a fan of the team, you'd be like, oh my God. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1346.48s)]
*  And there's one clear winner this year. We'll see if it goes. House, did you want the first pick [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1353.92s)]
*  or you didn't because we have one wrinkle this year. Coaches and GMs are now eligible for the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1359.04s)]
*  worst contracts draft. We've done coaches before. In the GM case, we don't even know what the [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1364.8799999999999s)]
*  contracts are, but you can still take a guy. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Anyway, House or [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1371.04s)]
*  Waz, one of you can have, you want the first pick Waz or do you want it? I'll go first. It's all [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1377.68s)]
*  good. It's so obvious. It's almost like a ceremonial first pick in the sense that we all know what the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1382.48s)]
*  outcome is going to be. And it's got to be Bradley Beal of the Phoenix Suns. Wow. Wow. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1388.4s)]
*  That was not who I had on my board. I still have him fourth. No shot. And the reason why is we [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1394.64s)]
*  just went through this exercise. The Suns were desperate to move this guy. They spent basically, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1402.8000000000002s)]
*  they did all kinds of tactics. They tried to bench him to get him to remove his no trick. Like [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1410.0s)]
*  they tried everything to get this man off of their team. Like they had Jimmy Butler on hold, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1415.44s)]
*  like ready to go, locked and loaded. They were going to improve their roster. They called everyone. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1423.6000000000001s)]
*  It was not possible. This is an immovable, it's literally can't be moved. This is an interesting [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1429.3600000000001s)]
*  case because it actually is untradeable. So from a worst contract, you can't trade it. I don't know. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1435.84s)]
*  He's winning me over, House. Not only can you not trade him, OK? And there was this sort of like, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1442.96s)]
*  I did it. Will Bradley Beal still a decent contributing player? Like the other night, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1449.2s)]
*  the KD and Bud game, they completely took off after Bradley Beal's ass went to the bench. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1454.0800000000002s)]
*  So he's getting 50 million this year, 53 million next year, and then 57. Well, he has got a player [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1462.72s)]
*  option. Yeah. Hold on. I wonder if he's going to take his player option. Shams is reporting. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1471.2s)]
*  He's exercised it. Yeah. His player option is 57 million and 26, 27, all while holding a no trade [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1475.3600000000001s)]
*  clause, which means he basically has the franchise by the barrel. OK, to me, this is still, because [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1483.3600000000001s)]
*  of the two extra years, still the worst deal in the NBA. And I get it. There's other guys here [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1489.8400000000001s)]
*  that I'm like, wow, this is tough. But Bradley Beal to me is the worst. So I quite love it. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1497.04s)]
*  And I'll just interject quickly. I think it would be fine if we wanted to rename this worst contract. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1503.44s)]
*  We just call it the Bradley Beal Memorial worst contract and just do it every year. Name this for [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1509.52s)]
*  Bradley Beal, like arguably one of the worst contracts in the history of bad contracts in the [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1514.3999999999999s)]
*  in the NBA. I would argue we should name it after Andre Blatch. That was only $27 million. I know, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1519.36s)]
*  but they they gave him an extension and then amnestied him before the extension kicked in. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1526.8s)]
*  We're never going to top that. That's never going to happen in the history of the league ever again. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1531.36s)]
*  I beg for them to do that with John Wall when they gave John Wall the giant extension. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1534.96s)]
*  Right. That could be the reason John Wall, too. The reason that Beal deserves this top billing [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1539.68s)]
*  is because he set two franchises back a grand total of how many years? It'll be at least [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1545.76s)]
*  14 to 15 years. If you add up the number of years that Washington is going to take to recover [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1552.24s)]
*  and be competitive and how long it will be before Phoenix is competitive again, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1557.6s)]
*  that's truly amazing. You've got to give it up to Tommy Shepherd for that one. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1562.64s)]
*  Well, it's also funny that the way they got him was they Chris Paul was an expiring, right? That [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1566.96s)]
*  they could have bought out after his next year. And then they had Aitin who they wanted to get [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  rid of. And they somehow turned that into Beal and then another guy who's going to be in this [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1577.44s)]
*  worst contracts draft a little bit later. It was like they took two things where they actually [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1583.52s)]
*  would have had some flexibility and now they're just stuck. I just want to mention [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1588.0800000000002s)]
*  his last two years, he's averaging 18 a game with 51, 40, 42, 82 percentage splits. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1593.76s)]
*  And on paper, you could go to basketball reference in 50 years and be like, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1601.04s)]
*  Bradley Beal wasn't that bad. This contract's devastating. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1605.12s)]
*  When do you think his last season playing 61 games was? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1609.76s)]
*  House would know this way better. Right before the extension, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1617.84s)]
*  right before like, you know, it was before the extension. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1620.0s)]
*  The 2018-19 season. There you go. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1622.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. How many playoff games do you think he's played since he lost to the Celtics in the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1626.32s)]
*  Kelly Olynyk game? He definitely, Russell Westbrook, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1631.04s)]
*  single-handedly dragged the Wizards into the playoffs. So he played four games [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1635.76s)]
*  as they got their asses swept in that series. And then I don't know how many, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1641.28s)]
*  was he played three, four games for the Suns? He's played 15 total. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1645.36s)]
*  Okay. So they're not making it this year. So that'd be eight playoff games, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1650.32s)]
*  15 playoff games in eight years for Bradley. Anyway, a stunning number one pick, but I kind [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1654.56s)]
*  of liked it. Bold. People tomorrow in the papers would be like, Big Waz, bold with his first pick. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1658.8s)]
*  And I gotta say, going through this list, there's just not as many horrific, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1667.2s)]
*  scary contracts as there used to be. I know. Yeah, we didn't have the same depth. Yeah, I agree. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1674.8s)]
*  Most of these contracts are like, eh, not that terrible. Some of them you could be like, oh, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1679.12s)]
*  it's kind of risky. But most of these deals, like even if a guy is slightly overpaid, it's not a [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1685.12s)]
*  franchise killer. The way this Bradley Beale thing is. And I'm sure, I'm pretty sure I know [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1691.04s)]
*  your next pick is going to be, but yeah, it's tough. How's your next pick? Well, this is, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1696.3999999999999s)]
*  so I respect Waz because he's a traditionalist. He went with the OG here. This is an out of, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1702.56s)]
*  slightly out of left field, but you know, this guy changed. He altered the course of two franchises. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1709.12s)]
*  Speaking of, you know, a five to 10 year recovery window for one franchise and another franchise [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1716.7199999999998s)]
*  that's going to enjoy, it should be at least another decade of prosperity. It's Nico Harrison. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1722.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, what Nico Harrison? I don't know how much money that man made. And I know that he is going [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1729.52s)]
*  to, I hope he's beefing up on the current offering of Nike sneakers or whatever, because that man [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1734.48s)]
*  is going to return to the sneaker business. He is, there is no franchise in the NBA that he can go [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1740.64s)]
*  to now. There are no more jobs for him in terms of a front office. How do you tell your fan base? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1747.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, even quietly, yeah, we brought him in because he's got this. No, no, no, no. This is his [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1754.08s)]
*  last job in a front office. And I keep looking for the definitive economic impacts. Like nobody's [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1759.76s)]
*  done the soup to nuts of how much money it will cost the Dallas Mavericks. Just over the next [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1767.3600000000001s)]
*  five years, I think it's going to take much longer than that for them to properly recover because of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1774.4s)]
*  what happened to Kyrie. But I, it's very, at the very, very lowest conservative estimate, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1780.3200000000002s)]
*  it is a billion dollars. It is a billion dollars in diminished value for that Dallas franchise. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1787.52s)]
*  When you think about the impact on revenue from, from attendance, okay, fine. All of that is, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1793.68s)]
*  is getting walloped. The revenue that they're going to get there and over the air, you know, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1799.52s)]
*  in their local broadcast, they don't have a regional sports network that they're on. They [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1804.8s)]
*  switched that. How are they going to get advertisers to pay anything to watch for people? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1808.6399999999999s)]
*  How about Jersey sales? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1813.84s)]
*  Right. Merchandise partners. How do you, how do you tell the, what are you going to tell those [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1815.76s)]
*  people? So on down the line, you can go through six or seven or eight categories, the ways the [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1818.8799999999999s)]
*  team make money, the way that the teams have cashflow walloped. Just take it right off. I think the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1824.0s)]
*  ultimate economic impact is going to be between a billion and a half and $2 billion. And think of [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1829.68s)]
*  how remarkable it is in this era where in every sport we look at them, we say the best investment [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1835.52s)]
*  that a rich person can make is in a professional sports franchise because no franchise ever goes [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1841.76s)]
*  down in value. This motherfucker, look at the alchemy he performs here. He took the golden [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1846.32s)]
*  goose and turned it into a golden pile of shit. Magnificent. That is the worst contract in [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1853.76s)]
*  professional basketball. And we don't even know how much he makes and he's number two in the worst [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1859.36s)]
*  contract trap. Yeah. I did something on my pod at the top on a, on Tuesday and I was thinking about [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1864.0s)]
*  it. Cause remember like when LeBron left Cleveland the first time and they would do those franchise [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1869.68s)]
*  values every year. And like last year he was on Cleveland. They were like the number two team. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1876.4s)]
*  And then a year later they were like 28th and it was just, they went from being like worth, I don't [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1881.1200000000001s)]
*  know, a billion point two to like being worth like 500 million. This is 15 years ago. If Luca wins the [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1886.88s)]
*  title with the Lakers this year, you could argue Dallas might, like this might be a, they have to [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1894.4s)]
*  move in the middle of the night and go somewhere else. Like just break leases. Like, like who is [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1901.0400000000002s)]
*  the guy in the Colts? Ursay? Yeah. They just moved to Baltimore in the middle of the night. It might [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1905.92s)]
*  be a move in the middle of the night one night. I don't know how they recover. And the way sports [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1910.88s)]
*  is consumed now with all these little kids get attached to players instead of teams and all these [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1916.0800000000002s)]
*  kids love Luca. I don't know how they come back. Like what this might be like a death blow. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1921.04s)]
*  It's tough. I gotta say I've been one of the biggest like, look, elements of wanting to move [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1926.64s)]
*  on from Luca were justifiable people in the media. Right? Like there are elements to it where I'm [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1933.44s)]
*  like, I understand why a team would say, you know what, man, this guy is going to be problematic [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1938.88s)]
*  after we give him $350 million. The bottom line is trading for AD just, it just, you just, you [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1943.84s)]
*  just had to do something more or better. Oh, you had to get twice as much in the trade. And then [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1950.9599999999998s)]
*  even then I'm not sure. Yeah. And then AD goes, it's just like the way he framed it in the media [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1956.56s)]
*  was about availability. AD goes down immediately. The first game he plays and now Kyrie's gone, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  Lightly's gone, Gaffer's gone, Artie's gone. Did you see Kid's thing? Did you see Kid's thing about, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1970.88s)]
*  he was, he took real offense that people thought it was the increased workload that, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1976.0800000000002s)]
*  that hurt Kyrie's knee. And he's like, it was a fluke injury. It was like, dude, we've been [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1981.6000000000001s)]
*  following the NBA our whole lives. Like this is Klay Thompson going down in the 2019 finals. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1986.3200000000002s)]
*  Cause he was playing like crazy minutes and doing some crazy workload. And then all of a sudden his, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1991.2800000000002s)]
*  his leg blew out. Like this is what happens in the league. The more you put on these guys, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=1996.0800000000002s)]
*  the more likely it is they're going to break down. Dumb ass. I have a question. I have a serious [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2000.32s)]
*  question because that, that trade was immediately followed by the Lakers trying to acquire Mark [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2005.4399999999998s)]
*  Williams. And then for whatever reason, having cold feet about that. And the reason- You mean [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2011.84s)]
*  when they backed out? They shook out a trade and backed out, became the first team in 15 years to [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2015.6799999999998s)]
*  back out of a trade? It was a smart back out. Good back out. They used the physical. Dallas acquired [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2021.6s)]
*  a hurt player and then got him hurt. And somehow he passed the physical. So I would like- Oh, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2028.32s)]
*  I like this house. So the better move would have been to back out of the trade because the physical [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2036.32s)]
*  because of the reaction, but now you've lit a fire on the Luka. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2041.6s)]
*  Well, now you've also sent open to the entire league, the possibility that Luka is available. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2045.4399999999998s)]
*  Let's see that auction. Let's see how the rest of the league responds to that. Let's have a proper, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2052.0s)]
*  I thought there was a possibility. I put it in the text threads within the first 12 hours, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2056.8s)]
*  that there was like this crazy Machiavellian play. I wish that that's what had come to pass, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2060.7200000000003s)]
*  but what Dallas did is prove to all of us, they showed their ass in terms of their inability to [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2065.84s)]
*  run very basic downside cases. Like here's the hope for outcome. Kyrie's awesome. AD's injury is [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2072.2400000000002s)]
*  behind him. We have all these giant guys. We're going to be good. And we're going to really [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2079.28s)]
*  compete this year. Then we have a window, but the downside case that any sensible, like rational [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2084.96s)]
*  business person would conduct is what happens if AD's injury is lingering or, you know, can't be [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2091.2s)]
*  overcome quickly. How does that impact, you know, the rest of the team? How does that impact directly [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2098.32s)]
*  Kyrie? What's our assessment of the injury risk to Kyrie going forward? Like what happened to [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2103.44s)]
*  Dallas is not extraordinary. It's the downside case, but now, now the rational basketball response, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2108.88s)]
*  the only thing that would make sense and possibly win the fans back, they got to throw Nico into [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2116.96s)]
*  the bushes. They got a trade AD. Well, Nico needs to move. I mean, why would he even want to stay in [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2123.04s)]
*  Dallas now? He should resign. Great point. Here's the thing. I'll make a prediction because we saw [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2128.6400000000003s)]
*  this in 2011 when Cleveland miraculously won the lottery the year after LeBron left. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2133.84s)]
*  I just think Dallas wins the lottery now. I'm going to bet on it. I'm going to bet on it on Fandl. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2139.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm betting on it. Dallas wins the lottery. No way. Yeah, this is like, we got to save [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2144.7200000000003s)]
*  basketball at Dallas. Oh, they got Cooper flag. Everything's okay. You don't like this idea, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2150.08s)]
*  house? Like a hundred to one odds. Well, I mean, gambling on it and it coming to pass are two [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2155.92s)]
*  different things. Of course I'll gamble on it. God, you took that. You guys took that so seriously. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2162.08s)]
*  I'm up. I don't know how he's still on the board. It's a, it's very reminiscent of the 2014 NBA [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2167.04s)]
*  draft when he fell to three. Vince Carter was half man, half amazing. He's half man, half available. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2174.4s)]
*  He's Joel Embiid. Yeah. Five years, $299.5 million left. Uh, by the end of this season, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2182.0s)]
*  because he's been scratched for the rest of the season, 452 games played, 440 games missed. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2190.16s)]
*  It's a very sad story. I don't mean to sound so excited talking about it. I'm just excited. He [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2197.6s)]
*  was still on the board. Um, I'm just going to read through his injuries guys. In college, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2202.08s)]
*  stress fractured in his lower back, mismatch madness. Right before the draft stress, stress [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2208.7999999999997s)]
*  fracture, navicular bone in his foot. 2014 rebroke the same thing. 2015 left meniscus tear 2017 [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2215.28s)]
*  fractured orbital bone 18 finger surgery, 2020 right meniscus tear 2021. So we tore meniscus [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2224.32s)]
*  in both legs, torn ligaments, right thumb 22 fractured same orbital bone 22, right torn lateral [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2231.6800000000003s)]
*  meniscus 23. There's two different meniscuses, I guess, in his right knee tore both of them. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2239.2s)]
*  Bell's palsy 24. And then this year they don't, they're not even telling us what the injury is. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2245.8399999999997s)]
*  It's just left knee swelling management that now he's out. And what's weird is the left [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2252.0s)]
*  knee was the one that's only been operated on once unless they're not telling us about one. And then [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2257.2799999999997s)]
*  the right knee, which isn't even the one that's having all the swelling has two operations, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2262.3199999999997s)]
*  four years left. There's no way out of this. And we've seen with the big centers, like once you [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2267.2799999999997s)]
*  keep breaking down like this, there's really no path back. And maybe if there's a path, it's 50, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2275.92s)]
*  60 games. Brutal contract wise. Why did they do the extension? Will we ever figure this out? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2280.3199999999997s)]
*  Why did they do it? I think they did it because it's like before he went down last year, he was [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2287.68s)]
*  basically averaged 35 points. He was having the best scoring season since Michael Jordan, literally, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2293.68s)]
*  in like 1988. And so the idea being like, look, when this guy was on the floor for us, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2300.24s)]
*  he was amazing. And even in his limited capacity against the Knicks, he was pretty good. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2306.0s)]
*  So the idea is like, oh, he's going to get back to that form before he went down midway through the [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2312.48s)]
*  season. I think the problem for me and what makes this a justifiable pick is that guys go down and [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2317.68s)]
*  it's like, all right, he's got an ACL, he's got a PCL, he's got a broken fibia, he's got whatever, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2325.2s)]
*  ankle, whatever. This is the problem. This is the procedure we're going to do. This is how long it's [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2330.56s)]
*  going to take for him to come back. It's going to be fine. They can't even tell us what is wrong [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2335.12s)]
*  with his knee and what they're going to do. People are throwing out micro fracture [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2341.76s)]
*  surgery. Do they even still do that? Dude, that's how dumbfounded they are by what they can do to [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2346.96s)]
*  address the problem in his knee. And it feels like there's nothing left to fix. Yeah, but why? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2353.92s)]
*  They said, so they do the extension, but then Bontemps writes that piece right before the [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2358.6400000000003s)]
*  season starts about how Philly finally has their plan to peak in the playoffs. And Embiid says, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2363.36s)]
*  I'm never playing back to backs again for the rest of my career. That would have been my [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2369.04s)]
*  extension, Red Flag. Call me nuts to just add the three million, three years and 170 million to [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2373.12s)]
*  a contract I'm already worried about. House, from what you saw from Embiid in the Olympics, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2380.24s)]
*  would you have given him an extension? Under any circumstances? Can you remind me, you did this [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2384.56s)]
*  outstanding podcast with the executive producer of White Lotus, David Bernad. And he described [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2389.92s)]
*  this phenomena. He said one of the best pieces of advice he ever got was from, I can't remember [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2399.2s)]
*  who the famous person was that gave him this advice. It had to do with, you know, you get inside [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2404.56s)]
*  of, was it the monkey cage? What was it? It was inside. Oh yeah. You can't get used to the smell [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2410.24s)]
*  of shit. You grow so acclimated to the smell of the shit that you cannot identify that there's a bad [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2416.4s)]
*  thing, that you're in a bad environment situation. So for me, the problem with the Sixers goes all [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2424.56s)]
*  the way back to what I will forever argue was an ill-advised and ill-conceived return to the [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2431.52s)]
*  playoffs by Embiid. He wasn't ready. He wasn't healthy. We know this. Was is right. He had a [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2442.56s)]
*  50 point game in the first game in Philadelphia. I went up there and watched it. It was awesome. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2450.4s)]
*  But he also had many dramatic moments where he went down on the floor and stayed on the floor for [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2455.92s)]
*  several minutes and then went to the locker room and then came back. That whole situation of him [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2461.36s)]
*  coming back to the playoffs and playing in under the highest leverage situation in the shape that [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2467.6800000000003s)]
*  he was in with his knee and the condition it was in. And then you go from that to the Olympics, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2473.36s)]
*  which are barely six weeks later and even less than that when you consider the training. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2479.28s)]
*  And the USA team says, look, it's on the player to make the decision about the player's health. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2485.36s)]
*  And what we saw from him looked like a competent Joel Embiid. Now he had some impactful moments. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2491.92s)]
*  He didn't look as explosive. No, they used his size really well, but you could tell he wasn't 100%. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2499.52s)]
*  Right. And so we come off of that. And that's the moment when the extension is given after [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2505.12s)]
*  the Olympics. And Winnhorst had a great story this week about some of the decision making and some [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2511.52s)]
*  all they went, you know, the six years talk to every single knee specialist in the world and got [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2518.4799999999996s)]
*  the input. That's a red flag. They wanted the assurance. The problem with the extension is [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2524.08s)]
*  what the fuck was the rush? Like, how about him just play the season, see what happens. Now, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2531.92s)]
*  Maury said, the quote that Winnhorst attributed to him was like, we didn't want to arrive in the [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2538.48s)]
*  summer of 25 and have the uncertainty, the potential chaos of him going somewhere else. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2543.2000000000003s)]
*  And my question is why the fuck not? Why not? He would have been 32 and had played 60% of the games [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2548.8s)]
*  in his career. Listen, I've known Darrell a long time. I think if there's a flaw with him, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2555.68s)]
*  I think he wants to be liked by players. And we saw that with the heart and thing fell sideways. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2561.04s)]
*  And I just think he likes him bead and wanted to take care of them and chose to see it as a [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2566.16s)]
*  glass half full versus a glass half empty thing. And I think the owners like him be too. And [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2571.68s)]
*  ultimately like that was what was so funny about last week when they're leaking out, like this was [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2577.12s)]
*  Darrell's fault. Darrell did this. It's like the owner makes the decision. They just stop. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2581.6s)]
*  One person is signing that extension and one person is asking all the questions and getting [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2586.96s)]
*  all the answers for it. But it's a devastating, devastating contract. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2592.16s)]
*  Just so folks understand, let's just say, presumably he plays three more years on this knee. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2596.56s)]
*  In 28, 29, he's going to be owed basically $70 million. That's tough. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2603.6s)]
*  There might be some insurance wrinkles with this. Because we found out more info about Zion's [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2614.7200000000003s)]
*  contract as the months came out and there might be some wrinkles with this. But as of yet, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2620.4s)]
*  we have not heard of any. And this just seems like a straight $300 million for a guy who doesn't [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2627.28s)]
*  seem like he's going to be able to play that much. In his age 30, what'll that be? 31 next year. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2632.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. If we were gambling on this before, like, what do you think is more likely? He [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2638.64s)]
*  retires in the next two years or he makes it to that third year of that contract? Oh, he's going [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2644.96s)]
*  to make it to the third year. He's not retiring. We have not seen, the only person we've seen [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2649.2s)]
*  retire is Andrew Luck. Yeah. Like just walk away from money. And that was seemed like a more like, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2654.64s)]
*  I don't want to put my body through this anymore. Okay. He's not going to retire before this [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2660.24s)]
*  contract is up. He can't. His accountant will not allow it. Okay. So 20 games a season out of him [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2664.8799999999997s)]
*  for the Sixers? Hey, it is whatever I got to do to make it to the finish line. And listen, look, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2670.7999999999997s)]
*  I think Joellen Bede is a bit of a tragic figure. A lot of a tragic figure. I mean, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2675.8399999999997s)]
*  everybody likes him. It is what it is. And he seems to want it really badly. It's just his body just [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2682.08s)]
*  straight up has not cooperated and that sucks. But at the end of the day, he's going to have like [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2687.12s)]
*  $600 million in career earnings. And I don't feel that bad for the guy, you know? Right. Well, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2691.52s)]
*  House and I are old enough to remember doing this dance with Bill Walton way, way, way back when [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2697.92s)]
*  Yao Ming, Greg Oden, Ralph Sampson. There's been a lot of big dudes that their bodies couldn't hold [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2704.96s)]
*  up because just fundamentally it's really hard for a seven foot three person to run up and down [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2711.68s)]
*  a basketball court for nine months a year and jump up and down and land on things. You're [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2718.3199999999997s)]
*  you're playing with fire. All right. We're going to take one more break and then we'll do the rest. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2723.04s)]
*  All right. Come back. Was is up. There's one big kahuna still left on the board. This is the last [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2726.16s)]
*  obvious, this is just horrible contract in my opinion, left in the league. There's ones, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2732.96s)]
*  other ones that are like, all right, this is pretty bad, but this is like horrific. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2738.4799999999996s)]
*  And it's Joe Allen Bede's teammate, Paul George. I honestly thought these two could be one, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2743.2799999999997s)]
*  two in the drafts. No, easily. I think so. I think you can make arguments for both. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2748.9599999999996s)]
*  We are in this situation with this worst contract draft where we have one guy who costs his team [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2753.2799999999997s)]
*  like a billion and a half dollars and another guy that costs his team $500 million. And both [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2758.4799999999996s)]
*  of those franchises are looking at a decade of pure misery coming up. Yeah. Amazing. So Paul [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2764.64s)]
*  George is four years to 11.6, three years after this one. Yep. Player option in 27, 28 for 56 [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2770.8799999999997s)]
*  mil. Probably opting into that one. I couldn't figure out a way to look this up because I'm not [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2779.04s)]
*  smart enough. But when somebody drops six points a game, just fundamentally, when somebody goes [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2784.16s)]
*  from 22 to 16 and they played, they're like year 12 or later, it usually doesn't come back. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2791.76s)]
*  I remember talking about this with Jermaine O'Neal 20 years ago, when you go from being a 24, 10 guy [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2799.36s)]
*  or 22, 11 guy, and now you're like a 15 and nine guy, it doesn't come back. And that would be my [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2805.1200000000003s)]
*  fear with Paul George. And I don't, they said like something's wrong with this finger, but it [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2811.92s)]
*  doesn't explain the lack of explosiveness. It's been so bad. And this is the thing. I think [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2815.68s)]
*  we got to give cut Darrell a break here a little bit in the sense that last year on the Clippers, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2821.7599999999998s)]
*  Paul George was an all NBA performer. He was the Clippers on-off numbers with Paul George on them, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2826.7999999999997s)]
*  both offense and defense. He was their best player last year. He was a bona fide star NBA [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2833.8399999999997s)]
*  player last year. And he's come into the 76ers environment, just turned into a pumpkin. I don't [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2841.36s)]
*  think we could have foreseen this. This is bad. This is bad. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2848.88s)]
*  House, this is one of those, we see this in sports sometimes, you had to do it, but you didn't feel [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2853.6800000000003s)]
*  awesome about it as you're doing it signings. We had this argument in October when we were [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2858.8s)]
*  doing the over under, pod, me, you and Rosillo. And I'm the only one that chose the over for [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2863.6s)]
*  Philadelphia. I own it, but I did understand the thesis. I understood all of the moves that [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2869.44s)]
*  Philadelphia made in their off season. It was a gamble. It was an all in, all the chips to the [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2876.4s)]
*  center of the table gamble where that Philadelphia team on paper, as we entered the season, looked [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2882.0s)]
*  like it had the potential to compete. I'm not saying beat, but compete with Boston. Boston is [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2888.88s)]
*  the standard. How can we get put guys around Joel Embiid? The whole thing revolves around Joel [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2894.8s)]
*  Embiid's health. That is, you know, obviously the biggest part of the gamble, but the other side of [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2900.0s)]
*  the gamble is that Paul George will show up. The thing that the sixers had done successfully in [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2905.6800000000003s)]
*  the two seasons leading up to this season is in those chunks of time that Embiid was missing, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2911.04s)]
*  they could tread water and they were able to tread water through the players that they had. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2916.0s)]
*  Paul George was supposed to be the tread water character, but that dude showed up. I will never, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2920.64s)]
*  this will always be Paul George for me. And I hope when he gets into the hall of fame that they put [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2925.8399999999997s)]
*  this picture up as part of the montage for his legacy, him putting his mouth on his wife's titty [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2930.08s)]
*  on a spring break, you know, during right before the all star, you know, the players that aren't [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2936.64s)]
*  involved with the all star game are off on their version of having a break. And that man has to go [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2943.2799999999997s)]
*  to put on his Instagram, his mouth on his wife's titty. That will forever be the Paul George moment [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2950.24s)]
*  for me. That will forever, I'll always think of him under that context. That's it. That's it. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2955.68s)]
*  Well, next year is year 16 for him in the NBA. Damn. Wow. The year after that will be year 17. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2960.9599999999996s)]
*  And then the last year of this contract will be year 18. Not feeling great about it. And he's [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2967.68s)]
*  another one that's had some, some physical stuff, right? He's got the rod and his leg and all kinds [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2971.68s)]
*  of things. Well, house you're up in the, in the, uh, there's, I think there's one prime time guy [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2977.12s)]
*  left here, but we'll see if you take them. Oh, interesting. Cause I'm not now I'm officially [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2984.56s)]
*  kind of having the draft is dropped. Yeah, I'm having a hard time. I think there's one good one [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2989.3599999999997s)]
*  left, but let's see. We can do houses. It's round two and houses already like flummoxed and can't [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=2995.3599999999997s)]
*  figure out who to pick. No, I'm not flummoxed. I know who I want to put in here and you know, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3001.04s)]
*  um, I'm prepared to take all of the slings and arrows. It's Scotty Barnes. I don't like the [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3006.8s)]
*  Scotty Barnes extension. I don't like it. What one bit they have. This is the thing, right? And the [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3011.44s)]
*  reason why I'm putting him in at this moment, I know what I'm going to take from, from, from Toronto, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3017.36s)]
*  the bullets I'm about to take from, from the Raptors, but somebody proved to me that he is not [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3022.96s)]
*  Zach Levine. Somebody proved to me that he is not Trey Young. The problem with paying a guy that's [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3028.88s)]
*  not ready to be the leader of the team. And look, you, you can say he's been hurt. Well, yes, he's [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3036.2400000000002s)]
*  been hurt. He's only in the fourth year of his NBA career. I don't want guys that are missing [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3043.76s)]
*  chunks of time. The way that Scotty Barnes is missing time now. Can we give the contract [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3050.2400000000002s)]
*  because he's on the last year of his rookie deal, which is 10 million. Next year we're kicking in [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3055.04s)]
*  five years, two 24. So you're not, you're not a fan. Well, he's, he's, it's the, it's his worst year, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3060.96s)]
*  um, shooting percentage wise of his entire career. So I've been, I, I've been saying this for a while [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3069.04s)]
*  and the Toronto fans get mad. I'm not against Scotty Barnes becoming potentially a guy, but they've [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3074.64s)]
*  been, he's been treated from day one like he's a future franchise guy. Remember he wasn't in the [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3079.44s)]
*  Katie trade. Yeah. And I got yelled at a few years ago because I implied that he wasn't the [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3084.72s)]
*  next Kawhi Leonard. People thought I was insane and they kept saying, look at his rookie stats [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3089.52s)]
*  compared to Kawhi's. I'm like, guys, like this is not like, I think Scotty Barnes is a really good [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3093.52s)]
*  player. I don't think he's anybody's idea of a number one. I think he's a good player. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3100.16s)]
*  I don't think he's anybody's idea of a number one option. I think around the right circumstance [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3105.52s)]
*  where he would be de-emphasized and just kind of just solely allowed to focus on his strengths [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3110.24s)]
*  and not, you know, firing up threes on a regular basis. Controlling the ball at the end of the game. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3116.3199999999997s)]
*  It's that Iguodala-Philly situation, right? Where it's like, all right, you're not really a number [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3122.64s)]
*  one guy, but if you're a number three guy on an awesome team, you might be awesome. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3127.2s)]
*  Tell me when he will make his first all NBA team. Hey, he made the all-star team last year, House. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3131.2799999999997s)]
*  All-star. All-star. All-star. So he's knocking on the door, theoretically, on all NBA. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3139.76s)]
*  I've never been the biggest Scotty Barnes person, but I don't see his contract as like, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3147.52s)]
*  you know, some kind of death knell to Toronto's future. I think some of the team building, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3155.36s)]
*  they've, you know, taken the actions they've taken in that direction, I think are highly problematic. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3160.2400000000002s)]
*  But I don't think Scotty Barnes is like, some horribly overplayed guy. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3167.28s)]
*  I love it. House has replaced Trump as the number one enemy of Canada. I love it. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3171.36s)]
*  I put him where I put him because we've seen this song and dance before. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3178.4s)]
*  It's good. And you warned us about Bradley Beal. You've warned us about guys in the past. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3183.1200000000003s)]
*  Scotty Barnes averaging 28 and six. He's shooting 27% from three. And the team loses year after year. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3186.8s)]
*  Worst shooting percentage. So here's what I compare Scotty Barnes to. I compare it to the [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3194.0s)]
*  deal that Wiggins got off of his rookie extension, where Glenn Taylor said that, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3199.28s)]
*  well, Andrew Wiggins promised me that he was going to work his ass off in the off season. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3205.68s)]
*  And so I gave him the max contract extension. Like, he hasn't put it on the court that he's [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3209.84s)]
*  worked at, but he promised me, he gave me his word. I think if Scott, I think I look at his deal like [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3213.84s)]
*  that, like you look at the talent, where they drafted him, the idea that they're just not going [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3218.96s)]
*  to give him a max extension, I think would have been problematic for their management. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3223.04s)]
*  And I'm like, in a few years, can Scotty Barnes be the finishing piece, even at a [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3228.16s)]
*  slightly inflated or an inflate of vastly inflated, according to Joe Howe's contract? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3234.0s)]
*  Could he be help a winner, like elevate their situation the way Wiggins did for the worse? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3239.52s)]
*  I think he could potentially. That's why I'm not so, so down. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3245.52s)]
*  When he's a fourth banana. Okay. I'll keep my eye on it. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3249.44s)]
*  $50 million fourth banana. There you go. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3252.96s)]
*  There we go. I just came back from, from the grocery store. It's not that far off. I'll tell you. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3255.44s)]
*  He turns 24 in August. Listen, they need him to be a number one guy. If they're going to pay him that [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3262.6400000000003s)]
*  kind of money. I agree. I like the pic you used history. Some, I think this young guy might be a [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3268.7200000000003s)]
*  max guy. So I'm giving them a max when there's no actual evidence. He's a max guy and look at his [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3276.7200000000003s)]
*  stats and his basketball reference page is really good. We have seen this go wrong many times. I [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3280.96s)]
*  like the way we can see too. Well guys, I feel like I've already won the draft. I got Joellen [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3284.96s)]
*  bead with the third pick. Kawhi Leonard still on the board. I don't know. What are you guys doing? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3289.92s)]
*  Kawhi Leonard three years, $149 million. He's played 20 games this season. He's played 249 games [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3298.08s)]
*  and six years for the Clippers. He's played 15 playoff games. What, what, what does he [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3306.0s)]
*  call Ripken jr. All of a sudden what is happening? You know, what's so funny bill is that when I [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3310.88s)]
*  looked, I looked at Kawhi's contract, but I looked at it next to Paul George's and I was like, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3316.8s)]
*  not so bad. And plus like he's been playing so well recently. I'm like, but you're right though. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3322.56s)]
*  It is. I watched last night and it's like, there's Kawhi at during a time out wearing a, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3328.16s)]
*  wearing a, you know, jogging suit. It's like, oh, I guess he's not playing. He just straight up does [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3332.24s)]
*  not play. And that's what never know if he's going to play. You go to a Clipper game. It's like, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3337.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, Kawhi's warming up. He's going to play. This is great. I'll confess. I might have a little [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3341.3599999999997s)]
*  softer view on Kawhi because at the end of the day, I think that everything the Clippers have done [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3347.3599999999997s)]
*  with him has been part of the wildly successful arrival of the Intuit center. I think what [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3354.96s)]
*  Ballmer did was try and create a credible product. Yes. Not an incredible product, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3363.44s)]
*  a credible product. And the way that he did that was he used Kawhi as the vehicle. It has been a [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3370.56s)]
*  gross overpay from really the, the, ever since he arrived from, from the Raptors, each of the, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3377.52s)]
*  the two extensions were gross overpays, but for the purposes of what the Clippers are trying to, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3384.8s)]
*  the identity that they're, you know, they, they want to be relevant and the risk of him, you know, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3390.8s)]
*  not being available was kind of worth it. So risk it's the fact of him not being available. So the [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3397.04s)]
*  case for this contract, they had a really fun Lakers game a couple of nights ago and Kawhi played, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3403.6800000000003s)]
*  played 40 minutes, 13 for 23, 33 points, 10 rebounds and looked like he was every bit as good [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3409.04s)]
*  as Luke and LeBron. And that's why he did it. Now, if he, if you got it, saw a tweet tomorrow and it's [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3415.76s)]
*  like Kawhi Leonard has been shut down for the next three weeks, wouldn't be surprised at all. And [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3421.6800000000003s)]
*  that's why for 50 million a year, I got to put them on there. Uh, 249 games in six years for the [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3425.28s)]
*  Clippers is nuts. Waz you're up. My next contract is like this, I feel like this contract goes under [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3431.36s)]
*  the radar because this franchise is just known for an aptitude basically. Um, but it doesn't get [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3438.56s)]
*  talked about enough. And to me, this contract just signals like everything this franchise is about. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3446.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's Patrick Williams of the Bulls. I had him on my list. Interesting. Like this dude is going [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3451.44s)]
*  to make $18 million per year until 2029. And like he's never been good. He's not good now. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3457.84s)]
*  And like what, there was no reason to do this. Like they, who are they competing against? Five [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3467.52s)]
*  years, 90 million for Patrick Williams. He's like a nice man. This guy has been theorized. It's like, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3472.4s)]
*  Oh, look at the body and the three and D and it's just never ever materialized. And it's just what [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3477.36s)]
*  the Bulls do. Nothing they've done aside from finally, thankfully moving on from Zach Levine [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3483.12s)]
*  makes any sense whatsoever. But are we even sure that they're even going down the rebuilding, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3490.4s)]
*  you know, path? We don't even know if that's the case, man. But like the, the Patrick, as soon as [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3496.48s)]
*  they inked this, it was like, what are they doing? Like, why would you do this? The Bulls are your, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3501.3599999999997s)]
*  your guy in your fantasy league, your, your friend that you haven't talked to in 12 years, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3505.8399999999997s)]
*  who doesn't really make any moves. And then every once in a while we'll spend $58 in the free agent [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3509.76s)]
*  auction. And you're like, Oh, there he is. It's like trying to finish sixth place. What's this guy [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3515.1200000000003s)]
*  doing? I just like speeding in the league. He likes speed on the email threads. They're embarrassing. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3521.28s)]
*  I, I have Patrick Williams too. He's 26 minutes a game somehow this season, averaging 37% from [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3526.0s)]
*  on field goals house. And I've never, I just don't get it when I watch them. He doesn't really jump [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3533.92s)]
*  out of the TV. There seems like there's 20 guys like him. I don't know why you would pay him. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3539.2s)]
*  I think five years from 50 would have been kind of the same. I don't get it. Dude for the season, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3543.68s)]
*  he's shooting 37 and a half percent. He can't shoot from the field guys. He's six foot eight. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3549.6s)]
*  How's your up? This is crazy. It's time to have the Terry Roger. Yeah. Welcome. Welcome. Now two [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3556.7999999999997s)]
*  years, 51.5 million left for Terry Roger. Look at it on the face of it. 25 million bucks for [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3566.4s)]
*  a shooting guard. This capable of being a prolific score. It's okay. The problem is [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3573.6s)]
*  we have a sizzle reel from this season that shows him actively, actively undermining the ability of [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3581.36s)]
*  the Miami Heat to win basketball games. It looks like he's completely lost his ability to play [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3592.16s)]
*  basketball because I looked at, I looked up when they made the trade last year, because I remember [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3596.3199999999997s)]
*  thinking like, Oh, getting Terry Roger for what they gave up like a first for him. I would much [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3601.36s)]
*  rather do that than give all the shit you had to give up for Dame lowered, which included Tyler hero. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3606.96s)]
*  Right. So when they traded for him last year, he played 30 Charlotte games, 23.2 points a game, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3611.68s)]
*  yeah, 36% from three and, and was playing awesome and was like crunch time. He was a good player. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3618.2400000000002s)]
*  I thought my game made a great pickup. Yeah. This year, his stats are almost half. He's 11.8 points [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3624.4s)]
*  a game. He's shooting 40%. He's shooting 29% from three. And I test wise, he might be the worst [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3631.92s)]
*  rotation guy in the league. And I don't know what happened. And there's lots of theories floating [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3638.6400000000003s)]
*  around, not hard to find, but it really seems like whatever, there might be a scandal with him. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3643.92s)]
*  There might not with some of this betting thing, but it really seems like it, it sent him into an [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3649.92s)]
*  absolute tailspin, but they keep playing him as the part I don't get house. I wonder, you know, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3653.84s)]
*  we can theorize about stuff that doesn't take us into uncomfortable territory. No team in the NBA [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3660.2400000000002s)]
*  has more double digit leads that they've coughed up in the fourth quarter than the Miami Heat. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3667.4399999999996s)]
*  And I, on the ringer gambling podcast, just this past Monday said, one of my favorite betting [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3675.2799999999997s)]
*  strategies over the last couple of weeks and will be until the end of the season is to find situations [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3679.9199999999996s)]
*  where Miami has a lead going into the fourth quarter and watching them cough it up. They down [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3685.4399999999996s)]
*  the stretch in the last six minutes of the game have no apparent game plan. It's ISO to hero, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3691.76s)]
*  but Rozier's contribution to that. And again, who knows? I wonder if they quietly went to him [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3700.0800000000004s)]
*  and were like, dude, we're really not trying to make the playoffs. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3706.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, so they're the seventh seed right now, 29 and 32, Orlando's 29 and 34, Atlanta's 28 and 34. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3710.88s)]
*  So they could fall to the nine seed pretty easily if they wanted to. The shocking thing to me is [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3719.6s)]
*  they are a bottom half of the league from a talent standpoint. The weirdest thing to me that I, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3725.2799999999997s)]
*  that I think helps your theory house is why they didn't want Schroeder. Why didn't they want him? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3729.92s)]
*  Great point. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3735.04s)]
*  Like they, they actively try to not keep him in the trade. It's like that guy actually would [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3736.16s)]
*  have been a really fun heat that would have helped you. And now instead you're playing [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3741.12s)]
*  Terry Rozier. I don't, I've never seen some somebody who is not past this prime, right? He was, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3745.2799999999997s)]
*  I think he was, I'm going to say he's 30. I've never seen somebody crater. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3753.92s)]
*  He's 31 on St. Patrick's day. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3758.08s)]
*  I've never seen somebody crater where last year you're watching going, man, Terry Rozier, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3760.72s)]
*  could he make the all-star team to this guy is now the worst rotation guy in the league. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3765.12s)]
*  Good pick house. I feel really bad with my next pick. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3769.7599999999998s)]
*  Doesn't make me feel good. I almost want to take a shower after, um, he's somebody I did not like [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3774.2400000000002s)]
*  for a long time and he really won me back over the last couple of years. I really respect him. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3780.1600000000003s)]
*  I really feel bad for him. I feel for him. And this is way too soon, but I have to take Kyrie Irving. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3784.96s)]
*  He only has two years left at 84.9 million. He's not playing this year and I don't think he's [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3792.1600000000003s)]
*  playing next year. Wait, is this one that's the extension and Nico Harrison is going to eventually [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3796.7200000000003s)]
*  give him this summer? Well, regardless, he's, if he, this is this, these Kyrie, the ACL injury, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3802.0s)]
*  when it happens at this point of the season, it's usually a season and a half. We saw it with Jamal [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3809.76s)]
*  Murray in football. You can come back in less than a year in basketball. It doesn't seem like you can. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3815.52s)]
*  So basically he's not going to play again on this contract. And I feel bad, but I don't see a worse [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3820.64s)]
*  contract left than two years, 84.9 for a guy who can't play. So not his fault. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3826.88s)]
*  Stuff, stuff. And again, I do, I think Dallas was good. They were basically going to be over a [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3832.56s)]
*  barrel this summer and have, they would have maxed them. They would have given him a max extension for four [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3838.2400000000002s)]
*  years, which would have been kind of insane. With a lot of scary history for the smart guards. But now they could probably wheeze a lot of that. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3843.44s)]
*  And so maybe that'll be a mitigating factor in the next deal. But yeah, he's not playing next year. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3850.32s)]
*  Wait, you're saying that a team owned by Patrick Dumont, who just traded the most popular guy in the [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3855.68s)]
*  history of the franchise since Dirk DeWittsky and then talked all kinds of leaky shit about him after [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3861.68s)]
*  they traded him, would do something shady? Stuff. He said he wanted them to exhibit the work habits [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3868.08s)]
*  of one Shaquille O'Neal. That was tough. Am I up now? You're up now. Go ahead. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3873.2799999999997s)]
*  So, actually, let's take one more break and then you're up. All right. Let's go speed round from now on. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3881.12s)]
*  Waz, you're up. Who do you got? This is kind of easy for me, to be honest. And it's Brandon Ingram, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3887.2799999999997s)]
*  another guy who nobody, they tried to trade this guy for two straight years. Basically, David Griffin [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3893.7599999999998s)]
*  was like, bro, we're not paying you a penny over your current salary. Like it's not going to happen. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3901.52s)]
*  They fought and they fought and fought. Nobody would take this guy. Golden State needed a forward. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3905.8399999999997s)]
*  It wouldn't take him. It was like, no, thank you. Everybody said no, thank you. And then, of course, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3910.8799999999997s)]
*  like the Raptors, for reasons I still don't understand, traded for the guy, gave him the [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3915.68s)]
*  extension, three years, $140 million. And then, you know, right after, my guy, Jake Fisher is like, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3921.4399999999996s)]
*  yo, they're probably going to trade RJ Barrett next summer. Like, what was the point of this? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3928.48s)]
*  I don't get it. He's not a fit next to Scotty Barnes. He never plays any defense despite, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3934.16s)]
*  you know, the physical tools and the profile. He's always just been a kind of like, give me the ball, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3941.2799999999997s)]
*  let me cook and not going to elevate a single thing around me. Hates taking spot up threes. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3946.64s)]
*  I don't understand the trade. I don't understand this deal. I don't understand what Masai Ujiri has [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3952.48s)]
*  done basically since 2019. To be fair, it's three years, $120 million extension. $120 million, sorry, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3960.0s)]
*  not $40 million. And it's still awful because that's $40 million a year for a guy that they, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3967.28s)]
*  that New Orleans could not trade for a solid year as an expiring contract. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3970.96s)]
*  I love it because it's a confession about how they feel about Scotty Barnes. So it's wonderful. It [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3975.12s)]
*  feels like it validates. Oh, it's a win for house. Yeah. It feels like an extra win for me. Also, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3980.24s)]
*  I love putting a worst contract on here that hasn't officially kicked in yet. I think kudos [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3985.36s)]
*  to everybody involved. It's on its way. Masai Ujiri, who remember there was that moment when it's, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3990.4s)]
*  it was like, could the Knicks just turn over the entire franchise to him? Is this guy the next, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=3996.48s)]
*  see the next guy? And he did a great job with the Raptors in the 2010s, but holy shit, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4001.44s)]
*  the last five years, I disagree with basically everything they've done. I just don't understand [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4007.44s)]
*  it. House you're up. This one, I understand the controversy surrounding it. I have to though, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4012.88s)]
*  put a bright light on Jamal Murray because an enormous, enormous contract for a guy. Remember [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4020.48s)]
*  where we are with him in terms of his injury situation and his execution. Our recency bias [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4032.56s)]
*  will tell us this guy is a mad killer when he's healthy, but the dude's only been healthy for [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4039.36s)]
*  about six weeks now. And I adore him next to Joker. I want to be very plain about this. Very clear. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4046.88s)]
*  I love the contribution of Jamal Murray to the Denver Nuggets. I'm very excited to see how this [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4055.28s)]
*  playoff shakes out, but his injury history, classic does to that, to that franchise. What he [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4061.76s)]
*  does to that franchise when he can't play it, it, it, it ruins an all time historical figure in, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4068.88s)]
*  in the Joker. It takes so much off the table with the Joker. So when you're staring at it says five [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4078.0s)]
*  years, $243 million, that's a big, that's a big gamble. That's a big, that's all I want to say. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4084.0s)]
*  That's a big gamble. First of all, classic house backhand compliment talks about what a great fit [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4092.0s)]
*  he is. Thank complaints about the contract. The extension was four years for 207.8. That kicks in [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4096.96s)]
*  starting next year. I'm, I'm personally fine with it. I had, I had, I had a way later in the draft. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4103.28s)]
*  I had a way later in the draft. You gotta, you gotta have to pay the money. You have, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4109.2s)]
*  he definitely made my list, but it's like, you're the nuggets. This guy's been a part of the [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4112.48s)]
*  greatest team in the history of your franchise. You drafted the guy. They love the guy. If the [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4117.28s)]
*  nuggets make another finals runner too, I think this is completely justified to keep the error [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4123.28s)]
*  going and all of that, but I'm not going to lie. House, some of these Jamal Murray box scores to [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4128.96s)]
*  start the season. Definitely my eyebrow was raised for a while. The performance between Canada and [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4134.32s)]
*  the goddamn Olympics. That was scary stuff for me. But as of lately, he's dropping 50 on guys. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4140.4s)]
*  He's looking spry. I love it. I'm feeling more confident, but it's scary when you think about [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4146.4s)]
*  his injury history. I think house has moved into the clear number one spot for a guy who's going [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4150.719999999999s)]
*  to take the most shit online from this draft. And I can't wait for it. I'm going to read you the [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4155.36s)]
*  salary years for my pick yet another great pick. I'm, I feel like I'm dominating the draft now. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4160.719999999999s)]
*  Um, 43.8 to $7,587 this year. So almost 44 million this year. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4168.0s)]
*  Three-year extension kicking in for 109.5 million next three years. That's right. The Stifle Tower [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4176.96s)]
*  himself, Rudy Gobert. I had him circled. So they had, this is a really interesting one. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4184.639999999999s)]
*  They had him at 43.8 this year and 46.6 next year. And they, they thought they would get all smart. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4192.16s)]
*  They're like, Hey Rudy, let's wipe out that player option for the 46.6 and we'll give you the three [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4200.48s)]
*  years 109. And then we'll turn Carl Anthony Towns into D Fuenchenzo and Julius Randall. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4207.44s)]
*  And it's a re reallocation of money. It's going to be great. Um, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4215.36s)]
*  um, so Rudy Gobert who is having the worst statistical season he's had, um, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4219.44s)]
*  is it fair to say he is unplayable in a Laker series and OKC series and a Golden State series? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4226.639999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. I don't think that's a fair characterization. I look, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4235.44s)]
*  you think he sees the court in a Laker series. You think he sees a fourth quarter [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4240.16s)]
*  Yes. In a Laker series with Luca and LeBron in the game. Yes. 100%. I think so. I think [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4244.4s)]
*  Rudy was the anchor of by far the league's best defense last year. Um, the, he was keen to beating [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4252.16s)]
*  Joker in the playoffs. He was, I mean, it was, it was a trio, but Rudy played a major part [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4260.32s)]
*  in sort of like keeping Joker contained. They wouldn't that in a dog fight, you know, seven [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4265.92s)]
*  game series. And then he got played out the court by Luca Donci and should the next series. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4271.36s)]
*  They, they justify, they justify it by saying, look, $35 million. That's probably the going [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4275.92s)]
*  great for starting centers. This guy's always been an Iron Man in terms of playing takes his, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4283.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, his conditioning and his body really super seriously to stay on the court. I, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4288.799999999999s)]
*  like, I understand the pick bill. I, I think that's not why they did it. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4293.839999999999s)]
*  I would be fine if that's why they did it. They did it because of the money, because they, they [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4298.64s)]
*  are worried about how much money they're paying. They didn't want to pay Townes what he was paying. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4303.2s)]
*  And they looked at it as like, we can get off this Randall deal hopefully next year, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4307.4400000000005s)]
*  cause we'll have an awesome season for us. So go into free agency. Guess what? Julius Randall [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4311.2s)]
*  will be opting into the $32 million next year. So they didn't get out of that contract. Deep in [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4315.84s)]
*  Shenzo they're going to lose. And now they're stuck with Rudy for three more years. And, uh, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4320.96s)]
*  I don't know, man, they're going to lose Naz read now. Naz read is gone. Like he's done. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4327.04s)]
*  He's leaving. They can't keep him out. There's no chance they keep him. He is going to New Orleans. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4332.72s)]
*  He'll go to Brooklyn. He could go to your Washington wizards. He's going to be making [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4339.84s)]
*  $35 million a year next year and it will not be in Minnesota. I think that Minnesota is going to [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4344.0s)]
*  find a way to keep him. I think that there's an off season. Right now. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4349.44s)]
*  Dinner bet. He will not be on Minnesota next year. It's not happening. He's not, he's not [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4355.68s)]
*  happening. Well, well look, I mean, you, you just went through, they moved cat. Nobody had that on [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4360.56s)]
*  their radar for money saving purposes. I think they understand the value. We'll see it in the [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4366.88s)]
*  playoffs. I think the Naz read is going to make such a compelling case over the course of these [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4372.0s)]
*  playoffs. Uh, if Minnesota goes anywhere, honest to God, my favorite matchup of the entire first [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4376.88s)]
*  round is Oklahoma city, Minnesota. I pray to God that we get that as our opening round in that [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4382.8s)]
*  thing. And, and the, the toll it's going to take on Oklahoma city sets up that, that matchup against [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4388.4800000000005s)]
*  potentially golden state in the second, God is so juicy. But to go back to the point around [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4393.84s)]
*  Naz read and Rudy go bear, if the go bear extension was for the purposes of, uh, you know, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4399.04s)]
*  does it make them more palatable as a trade asset? But they have to do something to keep [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4405.68s)]
*  Naz read. And I think Naz read will stay with Minnesota. What do you think was, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4412.56s)]
*  I think Rudy's going to stick around. Um, the idea that they had a three center rotation last year [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4417.12s)]
*  is just an anomaly. Like you can't keep three centers who are basically paid their market value [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4423.84s)]
*  on your roster when all of them are basically kind of started calibers. So I don't know. I [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4430.320000000001s)]
*  think they figure out how to do, how to make the Naz read thing works. I just, I'm just not as [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4435.360000000001s)]
*  disgusted by the Rudy deal. And I guess I've kind of become a Rudy convert, man. I just think a lot [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4440.64s)]
*  of stuff does gets a little bit underrated. And he's expensive, but I'm going to be texting you guys [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4446.88s)]
*  when he's sitting on the bench in the fourth quarter of a Laker series, watching LeBron and Luca [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4453.280000000001s)]
*  pick and rolls. Waz, you're up. By the way, Julius Randall is still available. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4457.92s)]
*  Another one. I take no joy from this, but Dejante Murray, um, after this year, he's got three years [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4463.200000000001s)]
*  at about 32 per, um, coming off of an Achilles injury. And it's just, it's tough. You tear your [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4471.12s)]
*  Achilles at guard and you're like, one of your main strengths is basically your athleticism, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4479.04s)]
*  your shiftyness. I'm not seeing it for him. And, uh, the deal is tough. I think this is going to [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4485.28s)]
*  end up being a bad deal for New Orleans, man. Four for 114 for him. I mean, it could be worse. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4493.679999999999s)]
*  They could have traded Dyson Daniels in the, oh, wait, sorry. How's your up? Um, it's mandatory. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4500.24s)]
*  If we're doing a worst contract, uh, draft, we've mentioned his name once, but he has to officially [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4506.4s)]
*  be a selection is Ben Simmons. Ben Simmons has to be the Ben Simmons buyout. You just take them [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4510.48s)]
*  anyway. Okay. Yeah. You can't have a draft, uh, and talk about bad contracts. Uh, Roscillo sent [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4517.04s)]
*  a hilarious text this week, watching him, uh, on the Clippers, uh, just making an observation [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4522.879999999999s)]
*  around what seemed to be Ben Simmons instincts for, for passing the ball. Some of like, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4530.719999999999s)]
*  it was just hard to really thread the needle in terms of what he was trying to accomplish, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4536.4s)]
*  where the ball was going. Uh, it's an honorary pick for, for Ben Simmons for me at this stage. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4541.52s)]
*  I like it. Um, you know, I'm upset that Patrick Lames is gone cause this is right where I thought [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4547.68s)]
*  I was going to be able to get him, but he's not a, he's not on the list anymore. Um, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4553.52s)]
*  I got to do a manual quickly. We got to go back to the Raptors. Wow. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4559.92s)]
*  You got to do it one more time. He's in the first year of a deal that pays him [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4566.16s)]
*  five years, 162.5 million. And I kind of like a manual quickly. Like he's 38% from three. He's [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4570.56s)]
*  instant offense off the bench, but his destiny on any good team on an actual good team would be a [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4577.28s)]
*  sixth or seventh man, a bench score, instant offense. That's how you'd want to ideally use [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4584.88s)]
*  him. And you don't pay 30 plus million dollars a year for a guy like that. You pay like [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4590.56s)]
*  14 million dollars a year. You pay the Celtics are playing Peyton Prichard, seven million a year. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4596.8s)]
*  Well, he's on, he's on the opposite of a bad contract. That's an amazing contract they got [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4602.88s)]
*  for Peyton Prichard right now. Right. Right. That would be the best contracts. That's one of them. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4608.72s)]
*  He'd be up there for sure. It's just too much money. If it was five for 100, I'd be like, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4613.68s)]
*  all right, I guess. But when you're talking about that much and now you're basically locked into [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4618.240000000001s)]
*  Barnes and Ingram and quickly as your three expensive guys, where the fuck are you going [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4625.280000000001s)]
*  at that point? What do you think is going to happen? You're going to win 38 games? Like, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4630.0s)]
*  I honestly do not understand what Toronto is doing. Anyway, Waz, you're up. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4639.04s)]
*  Uh, this is pretty easy for me and it sucks, but it's Grant Williams. This guy has three for 41. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4643.68s)]
*  Yeah. And he's just not an NBA player anymore. Straight up. Doesn't play. Just, just, he's just [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4651.84s)]
*  done. He's well, he blew out his knee, but you're saying next year? Next year, he's even when he was [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4658.8s)]
*  was playing and he was getting ticked this season, it was pretty disastrous. This was another, he was [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4665.92s)]
*  another Nico Harrison sort of unearthing, uh, just never, never panned out. Um, yeah, Grant, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4672.4s)]
*  Grant Williams, I think he's done. All right. House. Um, am I allowed to do a combo deal? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4680.879999999999s)]
*  Cause these guys, uh, to me fit the exact same profile and they are also in this, in this gamble [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4688.24s)]
*  phase. Why would you be able to take two picks in the same pick? I don't understand. All right. Then [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4694.0s)]
*  I'll choose Zion because you know, you can, you can imagine who the, who the foil would be, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4699.04s)]
*  who the other guy's name is, but I won't say it. He could still be a viable pick. You know, what we, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4703.84s)]
*  we need proof that the Zion can play, um, basketball for the entire season. I had, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4709.04s)]
*  I didn't know where to put them on the board because he's technically has four for 163 left, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4714.48s)]
*  but they have all these different outs for games played for weight, weight, weighing him. And it [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4718.72s)]
*  makes sense like a movable contract. I also think teams would have traded for it in February. If [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4723.5199999999995s)]
*  they had put it out there and I don't think they, I know teams kick the tires on it. I'm positive. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4728.8s)]
*  And I think New Orleans was like, no, we need, but maybe this summer we could see something. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4734.4800000000005s)]
*  He's looked good in a couple of these games though. I did too. I wanted to work. Um, okay. Well, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4742.0s)]
*  I need a white guy and, uh, this is very similar to what I just laid out with the manual quickly. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4748.0s)]
*  Grace and Alan at four years, 70 million to basically be my ninth man. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4758.16s)]
*  Like, yeah, he's shooting 43% from three. He's Sam, he's Sam Hauser. He's in that kind of level of [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4766.72s)]
*  like those white dudes, the calves have, there's a bunch of these guys and guess what? None of them [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4773.28s)]
*  are making 17, 18 million a year. They're all making like three, they're making four, they're [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4779.76s)]
*  making two. They're making, oh man, we found this guy in the waiver wire. They're not making this. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4784.8s)]
*  So congratulations, Matt Ishbia. You did it again. I mean, he's making Austin Reeves money. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4790.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy. He's making more than Austin Reeves. He's making more than Austin Reeves. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4795.68s)]
*  That's correct. He's nowhere near. I'm glad you brought up Austin Reeves because fuck the Spurs [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4800.4800000000005s)]
*  again for not making an offer that summer. I said it that whole month and everybody's like, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4804.4800000000005s)]
*  why are you just saying this? Cause you want the Lakers to lose them. It's like, no, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4809.84s)]
*  I'm saying cause Austin Reeves is good and he should have gone. Now that's somebody, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4812.72s)]
*  if he got a quickly deal, I would have been like, all right, a little high, but I would do it. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4816.8s)]
*  Waz, who do you have? I don't want to draw the ire of this fan base, but for me it's the bonus. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4820.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. I love when you do this. This guy is just overbearing. I think the team's limitations [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4828.400000000001s)]
*  are based on their commitment to this dude playing center. We're just like straight up, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4837.68s)]
*  you cannot guard the pain. Chelsea Doug Christie's changed up the game plan to make it just straight [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4843.360000000001s)]
*  up. Everybody just packs the pain and we allow teams to shoot threes now. That's it. We cannot [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4848.96s)]
*  guard the pain with the minus a bonus at center. And they just committed to it and I get it. He [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4854.0s)]
*  gets rebounds. He's a great guy. I get it. All of that. But like this guy is just not [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4859.200000000001s)]
*  worth what they're paying him. So they're paying him four for 186. It's year one of the new [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4864.88s)]
*  extension. Listen, he always has... You're another team and you've identified some bonus as somebody [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4872.4800000000005s)]
*  you want. Why? Why do you want him at that number? Because I want to win 43 games. Okay. Thank you. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4878.400000000001s)]
*  I think there's a world where you could build an awesome team around him, but I think it's really [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4886.88s)]
*  hard. Like you really have to put a lot of thought into every other player in that roster because [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4892.0s)]
*  he does have some limitations, but you're right. He's like the center version of Ben Simmons would [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4896.64s)]
*  have panned out. Wow. Every year, Subotus just takes straights from class on this. He really does. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4901.2s)]
*  Who do you have, House? I'm going back to an old favorite of mine. This guy is near the end of his [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4909.6s)]
*  career doing a very distinguished job of helping a franchise with a tremendous talent, try and see [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4918.0s)]
*  the best outcome. This is Damian Lillard time. He's playing well lately. Wow. I agree. Three for 161 [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4924.88s)]
*  for Damian Lillard. The problem is the amount that's left on this contract at his age and the [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4933.44s)]
*  history in the NBA of guards with his profile being effective. It's just really the end of the [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4939.52s)]
*  year thing. I said upfront that I'm glad that he's playing well because I'm glad for Milwaukee to be [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4944.56s)]
*  good. I'm pissed at Milwaukee. And our guy Doc. Doc's going to get to play golf at Bel Air with Doc. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4950.88s)]
*  We got to praise Damian Lillard. Now you pissed off another fan base. Well, I don't think so [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4957.200000000001s)]
*  because he's doing all that he can do. 161 is a gulp. And wait for the playoffs, House. You're [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4962.88s)]
*  going to regret this in the playoffs. I promise you. I'm trying to put it in the right category. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4970.32s)]
*  He's going to be good. I'm pissed at Milwaukee. I honestly think the Portis drug thing was a bummer. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4976.16s)]
*  But I don't think they should have traded Milton. They've taken off since he... I know that they needed [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4982.96s)]
*  some cap savings and that Kuzma is a live body. But I will tell you come playoff time without [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4988.799999999999s)]
*  any reservation or hesitation, a moment will come and Kyle Kuzma will have the effing ball at that [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=4994.799999999999s)]
*  moment and it is going to go badly. It's going... Chris Middleton I trust, Kyle Kuzma I do not. Best [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5000.24s)]
*  of luck to the Bucs. For my next pick, first of all, House has won the draft for pissing off the [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5007.5199999999995s)]
*  most fan bases. He locked it up two rounds ago. Milwaukee's not going to be pissed. Oh yeah, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5013.679999999999s)]
*  don't be mad. The Dane fans. There's a whole Dane line. I can't believe this guy's still available. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5017.36s)]
*  Three years, 66 million. Contavious Caldwell Pope. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5023.68s)]
*  Goes to Orlando. It's been a rough year in Orlando. Leaves Denver, Christian Brown comes in and is [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5031.2s)]
*  immediately like twice as good as he was. Goes to Orlando. Oh my God, twice as good. Come on, man. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5036.08s)]
*  Hear the stats. 60 games, 8.6 points, 2.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists. Congratulations on all that. 31% [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5042.08s)]
*  from three. He's rocking the 9.0 PER. Not what he's brought in to do. And he's playing 30 minutes [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5051.44s)]
*  a game and you could argue if anyone playing 30 minutes or more a game, he might be the least [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5060.799999999999s)]
*  useful player. And I know there's good defense. Look, he's a good defensive player. There's metrics. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5066.32s)]
*  Great locker room guy. Great locker room guy, all that. But I promise you they were looking for more [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5071.44s)]
*  than what he's given them this year with this contract. So he is my pick. Waz, who do you have? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5075.839999999999s)]
*  Ah, man, now I'm starting to get into guys that I really actually like as players. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5080.96s)]
*  That's part of the draft. This is tough. I think the Jalen Green deal [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5086.32s)]
*  is a tough one. Just the up and down inconsistent nature of his game, man. Two weeks he's up, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5091.2s)]
*  three weeks he's down. Well, can we give the deal one for 12? Yes. And then next year, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5097.36s)]
*  three for 105 as an extension. Which, what a play option at the end of it. And by the way, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5102.0s)]
*  good content for us because he's going to be in 58 percent of the fake trades we make in June. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5106.96s)]
*  Yeah, when we try to get them a superstar. And when we get to Devin Booker and we try to, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5112.56s)]
*  it's like, well, Jalen Green will be in it. And I think the ultimate indictment of Jalen Green [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5116.72s)]
*  and the deal is that Fred Van Vliet goes down and the offense just goes into the tank because they [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5121.44s)]
*  don't have a creator who can effectively get them into decent offense. And it's like, Jalen Green, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5127.68s)]
*  you're right here. You should be stepping up here. He cannot create anything for anybody else. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5133.2s)]
*  That would be the criticism. And I really like Jalen Green. Yeah. There was a moment last year [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5139.2s)]
*  when it really felt like it all came together and I have not seen it. It was waiting. House, you're up. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5144.88s)]
*  I can't believe this guy is still available, to be honest with you. And I'll take the criticism [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5150.4s)]
*  for some of my earlier picks, but Andrew Wiggins is still on the board. Look at this contract. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5154.88s)]
*  And please tell me the next time that you think that he is going to play 60 games in an NBA season. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5162.400000000001s)]
*  Please, please tell me the next time you think that that's going to happen. He's at 49 games [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5167.76s)]
*  right now. He played 49 games last season. He is living off of a contract that was a reward [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5173.280000000001s)]
*  for helping the Golden State Warriors win a championship. The award is totally reasonable. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5180.72s)]
*  You always forget to say the contract. Three years, 85 million. That counts this year. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5186.96s)]
*  That's a lot. That's a lot of money left for a guy that looks like he's lost some interest. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5192.48s)]
*  And his interest in basketball has always been kind of an open question, except for the championship [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5198.08s)]
*  year. Everyone's getting groggy. We're nearing the end of the draft and I haven't really pissed off [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5203.2s)]
*  the fan base yet. And I also haven't made Woz laugh hysterically with a pick yet. And I think this is [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5209.76s)]
*  going to be it. It's the most controversial pick of the late rounds. I got to do it. Four years, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5216.0s)]
*  163 million. Jammerant. Stop it. Get the hell out of here. Listen, it's the end of the draft. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5222.24s)]
*  Get out of here. I'm just trying to get value. I'm just trying to get value. Why doesn't he play? [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5230.56s)]
*  Why doesn't he play? They're conserving his body for the postseason, folks. Chill. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5236.16s)]
*  What's wrong now? What's going on? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5241.2s)]
*  When I asked for permission to combine players, I wanted to do Zion and Ja together because to me, [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5246.5599999999995s)]
*  they fit the same kind of like, when is Ja going to be able, like if the idea with him over his [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5253.12s)]
*  entire career will be to preserve him for the playoffs, then what does that do for your team? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5258.72s)]
*  You're paying- He's 25. What are we preserving him for? He should be playing every game. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5264.96s)]
*  He can't. There's no proof that he can. But he is- [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5270.16s)]
*  So this year he's played 38 games this year. He played nine games last year. He plays 29.4 [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5275.04s)]
*  minutes a game. He doesn't even play 30 minutes a game. They're conserving him. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5282.72s)]
*  They're being very conservative. And they're kid gloves bubble wrapping him. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5285.84s)]
*  And now, yesterday he didn't play well and he's like, I don't know if my shoulder is going to be [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5288.96s)]
*  good the rest of the year. So now I have a fundamental shoulder issue on top of all the [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5292.32s)]
*  other baggage. Look, there's 10 teams that are paying him that contract without blinking. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5297.12s)]
*  I'm just flagging it. We're near the end of the draft. The contract, the numbers are pretty high [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5302.16s)]
*  for somebody who doesn't seem like he's going to play all the time. Okay. Not mad at it. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5306.96s)]
*  Who do you got, Wes? This hurts me because he's one of my [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5312.32s)]
*  favorite players in the league, but it's OG on Inobi. That contract is so- [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5316.0s)]
*  I was wondering when he'd go five for 212. Big. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5320.32s)]
*  It's a huge deal with a guy who has an extensive injury history, especially muscle injuries, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5324.16s)]
*  which tend to happen with a lot of over usage, which newsflash, he plays with Tom Thibodeau. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5331.839999999999s)]
*  Asked me well dang about that. I love watching OG play. I love his approach to the game, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5340.0s)]
*  but this is so much money for a guy who doesn't create his own shot ever. He's not some great [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5347.36s)]
*  distributor. It's like, man, this is a lot. And he's a very good defender, but I will also [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5354.88s)]
*  say that Tatum and Brown aren't exactly quaking in their boots when they see him. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5361.36s)]
*  And that was one of the reasons they did that thing. I'm with you. He's [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5365.28s)]
*  for the injury issues with him that always are lingering. 212 is a scary number. House, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5369.36s)]
*  I'll give you one more pick. Thank you. And I want to say this name so we can have a quick [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5375.36s)]
*  conversation about him. I'm going to draw a distinction between him and Scotty Barnes. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5379.92s)]
*  I'm taking Lamello Ball here and the distinction that I want to make is- [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5385.44s)]
*  See, this is when the draft gets great. John Brandon Lamello Ball. I love it. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5389.839999999999s)]
*  But here's the distinction. I think Lamello Ball could definitely make an all NBA team [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5394.24s)]
*  and it could be like right around the corner. It's just not going to be in Charlotte. And I [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5399.36s)]
*  don't really quibble with Charlotte paying him this contract. I think it is commensurate [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5403.76s)]
*  with his talent, but his talent, he is a loser. He's a serial loser. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5409.280000000001s)]
*  You mean a loser of games, not an actual human loser. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5416.0s)]
*  Correct. Correct. There is no proof to the contrary. He's never played basketball in this [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5419.12s)]
*  situation, a serious situation where his team has been a winning team. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5423.92s)]
*  Where his team has been high-fiving and shaking hands and celebration after games. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5428.400000000001s)]
*  It's a unique experience for him. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5432.8s)]
*  For missing the winning component. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5434.48s)]
*  Good win. I can't believe we won seven games in a row. It's never been said. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5436.4s)]
*  With his talent, if he can stay healthy, another guy who can, you know, we keep seeing these [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5440.24s)]
*  nagging ankles here and there, but his talent is such that if he was with the right situation, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5445.36s)]
*  with the right coach, this would be an incredible contract potentially. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5452.32s)]
*  Cause I think he is supremely talented and I like his swag. It just needs to be redirected. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5455.52s)]
*  So in this circumstance with this team, tough one. I don't think it's bad money, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5462.320000000001s)]
*  but you know what? I'll take his career over Scotty Barnes and everybody from Toronto can go [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5467.200000000001s)]
*  ahead and send me poop sandwiches. I'm fine with it. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5471.84s)]
*  I'll recap the draft before I make the last pick. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5474.96s)]
*  Waz took Bradley Beale to kick us off. House took Nico Harrison. I took Joellen Bede. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5478.8s)]
*  And then it went Paul George, Scotty Barnes, Kawhi Leonard, Patrick Williams, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5484.64s)]
*  Terry Roger, Kyrie Irving. I felt bad about that one. Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, Rudy Gobert, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5489.04s)]
*  Dejante Murray, Ben Simmons, just inemoritis just has to be picked anyway. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5495.92s)]
*  Honorary. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5501.76s)]
*  A billion bucks. House just handed him on the board. I took Emmanuel quickly. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5502.4800000000005s)]
*  Then Grant Williams, Zion Williamson, Grayson Allen, Damata Sabonis, Dame Lillard, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5507.280000000001s)]
*  Contavious Caldwell Pope, Jalen Green, Andrew Wiggins, John Morant, OJ Ananobe, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5513.28s)]
*  Lamello Ball, and the last pick of the draft. Only because he has to, another guy, he's like Ben [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5520.48s)]
*  Simmons, he has to be in there. House is so excited. Zach Levine, three for 141. We gotta have him. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5526.719999999999s)]
*  Can't leave Zach out. Zach was outside the door knocking like, hey guys, I thought that was the [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5532.959999999999s)]
*  worst contract party. Hey, anybody home? Okay. I mean, the case for that, even though he's had [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5539.76s)]
*  a really good year, is the Bulls traded him and didn't even get good stuff back. They just got bad [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5548.64s)]
*  contracts from other teams. Literally a hilly beans. So apologies to the following people for not [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5554.72s)]
*  getting picked. Julius Randall, two for 64. Jimmy Butler, three for 159. Chris Middleton on House's [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5561.52s)]
*  withers, two for 169. Zach Collins, two for 35.7. Can't believe that contract is still happening. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5568.72s)]
*  How is he not in our draft? Yeah, he should be. Zach Collins definitely should be. Kevin Herter, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5576.4800000000005s)]
*  two for 35. Yeah. Terrence Min, one for 11 this year, then kicks in three for 47. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5581.84s)]
*  Laurie Markkinen, five for 237. I did look at him for the last couple rounds. I looked long and hard [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5590.16s)]
*  at it. I almost took him over Jabba Rant. Gary Harris, two for 15, just had to put it in there, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5595.2s)]
*  principal. Buddy Heald, four for 38. Can't believe he didn't get drafted. Teams are trying to sign [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5600.16s)]
*  him as an undrafted free agent for the draft right now. Drew Holliday, four for 134. Drew Holliday's [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5605.76s)]
*  tough. And another guy that's tough. He's got like a fucked up finger. That I thought about, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5614.08s)]
*  this bad model bio. He's having a horrible season. Everybody thought this was going to be a breakout [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5618.88s)]
*  year, particularly on offense. That just straight up has not happened. He's got a sterling reputation [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5625.76s)]
*  amongst people in our profession. So he won't get killed in like the media, but like he's been a [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5630.320000000001s)]
*  disappointment. Well, we've hit the end. I had a wonderful time. Me too. It was the worst contracts [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5634.8s)]
*  My favorite part is that everyone's going to be the maddest at house. Yes. I feel like maybe the [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5645.04s)]
*  Memphis fans come after me a tiny bit. Was who's coming after you? Probably Sacramento. Definitely [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5650.320000000001s)]
*  Sacramento. Oh, Sabonis. Yeah. The Sabonis hive coming at you. This was a blast though. Thanks to [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aganp7ZHZn8&t=5655.68s)]
