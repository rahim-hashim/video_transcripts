# Will Luka and Kyrie Redeem Themselves This Season? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs)
*  Dallas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=0.0s)]
*  We can spend one minute on this or we can spend 30. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=1.84s)]
*  The over-under is 43 and a half. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=4.8s)]
*  They're plus 185 for our division, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  which is an interesting short of Memphis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=9.36s)]
*  If you want to get excited. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=11.92s)]
*  They're somehow 25 to win the title. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm happy to book those bets. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=14.92s)]
*  Minus 192 for the playoffs. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=17.28s)]
*  I don't know where to start. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=22.56s)]
*  Where should we start with Cilla? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=23.76s)]
*  Okay, well, I mean, if you want to trump it all with, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  they have Kyrie as their number two guy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=29.32s)]
*  Good luck with the over. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=31.44s)]
*  It's a hard argument to counter. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=33.2s)]
*  But, you know, 43 and a half, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=35.92s)]
*  I think it's the lowest you're going to get [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=38.08s)]
*  with Luca at the stage of his career. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=39.64s)]
*  I think Luca finally is going to be a little pissed off [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=41.96s)]
*  about everything, you know, feeling like he still [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=45.28s)]
*  was doing it the right way, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  even though he needed to kind of step up his game. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=48.6s)]
*  He could make an excuse that his way was always working [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  because it made to the Western Conference Finals [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=53.6s)]
*  two years ago, which was still sort of weird [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=55.68s)]
*  with the fact that they beat Phoenix, you know, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=57.84s)]
*  I'm still not quite over that one. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=59.64s)]
*  But at 43 and a half, knowing they won 38 games last year, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=62.2s)]
*  still were sort of tanking at the very end [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  to protect the pick, and they won 15 two years ago. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  And I think Josh Green is going to be good. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=71.04s)]
*  I think Grant gives them something stable. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=73.92s)]
*  You know, they also brought in Seth Curry. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=77.08000000000001s)]
*  Something stable like the sound of conversation? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=78.92s)]
*  Well, he's just not Christian Wood. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=82.2s)]
*  A voice talking? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=83.48s)]
*  They don't have the Christian Wood option anymore [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  because like once you have to get Christian Wood [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  on your team to understand, like, oh, wait. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=87.68s)]
*  Well, we've had five years at Luka. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=90.2s)]
*  How many guys have been like, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=92.72000000000001s)]
*  well, we got to get rid of that guy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, he doesn't fit here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=96.4s)]
*  Does anyone fit with Luka? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's definitely getting to like the dangerous. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=100.2s)]
*  I just feel like we've been so hard on James Harden [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=103.76s)]
*  and it's just like, who does fit with Luka? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  No, it's, there's- [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=108.28s)]
*  Seth Curry kind of fits with him because we've seen it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  and they brought Seth Curry back, so I was excited for that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=111.56s)]
*  I love seeing the hope for Dante Exum [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=113.84s)]
*  that like he's been so nasty recently. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  Shout out to Danny Chow. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=118.16s)]
*  Danny, he's on Exum Island by himself with some rice. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=119.56s)]
*  Give me the over, which, you know, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=123.12s)]
*  I wouldn't want to do with Kyrie, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=124.64s)]
*  but I just think it's a low number [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=125.8s)]
*  for what a great Luka year it is. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=127.16s)]
*  Do you want to, can you put that in pencil [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=129.2s)]
*  until I'm done with my Dallas part? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=131.36s)]
*  Because I might bring you back. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=133.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=134.44s)]
*  What do you have, House? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=135.84s)]
*  I also prefer the over. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=136.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=138.68s)]
*  Because of how I, the esteem that I heap on Luka. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=139.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=142.16s)]
*  Kyrie has not had a normal NBA season since 2017. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=146.32s)]
*  No, it's true. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=149.76s)]
*  What were we doing in 2017, Rossello? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=152.6s)]
*  What were we doing like around April 2017? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  Were you with Van Pelt at that point? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=157.64s)]
*  Were you, you have your own show? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=159.6s)]
*  No, I think Kanell just got laid off [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=161.2s)]
*  and I was in Manhattan Beach looking for a house [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  and they were like, you're not being laid off. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  Can you please come back? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  That was actually exactly what happened. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=170.64s)]
*  How about you, House? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=171.76s)]
*  What was going on in 2017 for you? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=172.6s)]
*  I feel like I was trying to, in April, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  I probably was trying to figure out [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=176.56s)]
*  who could pay for me to go to the Masters. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=178.28s)]
*  That seems like what I would, that's every year. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=182.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  2017 for us, I think was like year two of the Ringer. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=185.2s)]
*  I just, he's played 290 games in the last six years. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  Is that low? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=193.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=194.28s)]
*  He's played 22 playoff games since the 2017 finals [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=195.2s)]
*  and every year he figures out a reason [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  to be unhappy about something [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=202.04s)]
*  or to go sideways on something. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=204.28s)]
*  And I just can't get out of my head [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=206.04s)]
*  that he's gonna try to force himself to the Lakers [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=209.44s)]
*  in January or February. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  They have all these assets that are ready, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=213.28s)]
*  they're ready to trade. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=215.28s)]
*  They did that Russell contract specifically to trade it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=216.84s)]
*  And if anything about the situation is unhappy [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  and he thinks he has another place to go, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=221.84s)]
*  we've seen what he does and I just don't trust it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=224.68s)]
*  And I don't really think he even necessarily wanted [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=228.64s)]
*  to resign with Dallas. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=231.2s)]
*  I just think he did. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  Now he's probably gonna, somebody will cut this clip [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  and put it on his Twitter timeline [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=235.64s)]
*  and then he'll tweet at it with like some weird emoji. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=236.88s)]
*  That'd be pretty cool though. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=240.56s)]
*  I'm just saying this is a six year track record [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=241.56s)]
*  of when was the last time you had a normal NBA season? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=244.04s)]
*  Six years. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=247.16s)]
*  This would be year seven. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  So I'm going under. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=250.88s)]
*  I just don't trust him. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=252.56s)]
*  If you're the second best player on the team [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=254.2s)]
*  and your name's Kyrie and I don't really love [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=256.52s)]
*  the rest of the team, they're relying on two rookies. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=261.0s)]
*  Like Lively's gonna play. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=264.44s)]
*  Like the Duke fans weren't even happy about Lively. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=266.0s)]
*  This was a year ago, it was in college. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=268.16s)]
*  Prosper, they're gonna need to play. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=270.2s)]
*  Josh Green who had some moments but was buried [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=272.12s)]
*  by the end of last year and then Grant [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=274.28s)]
*  was getting DMPs on Boston. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=276.16s)]
*  So on paper I get it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=278.24s)]
*  I was like, oh, I got this and that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=279.48s)]
*  But I don't really trust any of those guys. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=280.8s)]
*  I don't trust Jaden Hardy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=283.2s)]
*  Seth is probably the most reliable third guy on the team. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=284.28s)]
*  I like Grant. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=287.52s)]
*  I like Josh Green way more than Jaden Hardy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  But they buried him last year. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=291.72s)]
*  Remember Josh Green fell out of the rotation [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=292.8s)]
*  by the end of the year. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=294.88s)]
*  I like Josh Green too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=295.72s)]
*  Powell, how many at bats can he get? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  I like him as a backup in this spot [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  but to Lively being the starter. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=302.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  God, everybody likes Lively more after he left Duke. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  I feel like that's one of those NFL [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=309.48s)]
*  college football disconnects where one group can't believe [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=311.16s)]
*  the way the other group is talking about a player. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  And in this case, I didn't love Lively's draft stuff at all. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=316.8s)]
*  There's times you didn't even know [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=320.36s)]
*  he was right next to the rim. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=321.28s)]
*  It's one clip I have of him. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  That's the rookie centers? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=323.88s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=324.96s)]
*  No, I just feel like Luca coming in a little pissed off [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=325.8s)]
*  knowing how disappointing last year was. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  Luca is good enough to get you to 45 wins. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=332.24s)]
*  So- That's my view as well. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=334.48s)]
*  And to your point, everything that you laid out [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=336.2s)]
*  about Kyrie misbehaving this upcoming season could be true [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=339.28s)]
*  and they can still win games. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=343.24s)]
*  It's better for him to play well [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=344.6s)]
*  and try and force what he wants. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  I just think that's been, I think, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=349.44s)]
*  top three most dysfunctional NBA organization [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=351.6s)]
*  for the last 10 years. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  Like not the last five, for the last 10. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=355.72s)]
*  They've had the most weird shit and just hard stuff [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=357.36s)]
*  to figure out the most kind of zags and trades [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=361.48s)]
*  and they lucked into the Luca trade. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  But I just don't see any cohesiveness [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=365.72s)]
*  with anything about them and I don't trust Kyrie. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=368.48s)]
*  So if I'm wrong on this, so be it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=371.32000000000005s)]
*  But I just couldn't risk kicking myself [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=373.76s)]
*  and be like, God damn it, I got sucked in. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=376.96s)]
*  It's just a low bar. I'm not doing it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=379.24s)]
*  44 wins isn't over. But here's the thing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=380.92s)]
*  I'm with you normally on Luca's so good, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=383.24s)]
*  it's a guaranteed 45 wins, but the league is awesome. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  There's so many great players now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=388.2s)]
*  I don't know if you can just write that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=389.64s)]
*  To me, it's Jokic and Giannis are the only two now [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=391.76s)]
*  that you can say that's 50 wins blind. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  We've seen Curry miss the playoffs. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=396.24s)]
*  We saw Luca miss the playoffs last year. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=398.12s)]
*  So I'm out. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=400.44s)]
*  All right, so I'm under, you guys are both over. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=401.36s)]
*  We've had some good disagreements this year. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=404.56s)]
*  When are we on the clock with Luca for you, Rossello? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  What if they start out 24 and 26? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=409.92s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think the hardened thing [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=413.12s)]
*  that you brought up is interesting [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=414.96s)]
*  because it was kind of like in the beginning, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=416.6s)]
*  you're like, oh my God, this is amazing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=417.96s)]
*  Look at the numbers. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=419.76s)]
*  And those two series that he had against the Clippers [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=420.6s)]
*  are like all time things. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=422.76s)]
*  You don't have to look at the numbers, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=424.2s)]
*  you just watch the games. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  Be like, this guy is on another level. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=425.88s)]
*  The battle he was having with Kawhi there. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=428.36s)]
*  But when somebody needs the ball this much, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=430.2s)]
*  you do wonder, like I always wonder, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=433.4s)]
*  with the high usage rate guy at the top, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=435.64s)]
*  and it's worked for other teams, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=438.0s)]
*  but a lot of times you're like, okay, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=439.68s)]
*  the best option is him having the ball [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=442.52s)]
*  and making the decision every single possession, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=444.2s)]
*  but is that actually the best option [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=446.0s)]
*  once you get into the playoffs? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=447.44s)]
*  And it really comes down to what that person wants, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=448.96s)]
*  where it's just not my favorite despite how impressive [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=452.52s)]
*  he can be and how great the numbers are. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=456.32s)]
*  I don't see a lot of evidence of those two [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  being able to play together either. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=459.6s)]
*  And not so defensively. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  Just have a lot of questions about this game defensively. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  You didn't like five and 11? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=464.48s)]
*  No. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=465.6s)]
*  That didn't grab your attention? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=466.44s)]
*  I like when Kyrie tells the other guy how smart he is. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=468.20000000000005s)]
*  When he's like, hey, if you were smarter, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  you would have understood that I was doing this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=474.12s)]
*  ["Spring Day"] [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry5lkVAviIs&t=476.36s)]
