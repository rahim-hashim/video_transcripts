# Will the Bradley Beal Trade Work Out for the Suns? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k)
*  It turns out my father's day present was a Bradley Beale trade and it was a weird, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=0.0s)]
*  weird trade. We knew it was going to get weird this weekend, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=4.0s)]
*  Rossella because he was like, ah, Miami or Phoenix. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=6.36s)]
*  Those two sound good. And it's like, well, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=10.84s)]
*  Phoenix doesn't have any first round picks basically for the rest of the decade. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  And Miami is too smart to go all in on a Bradley Beale trade. They'll, you know, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=15.84s)]
*  they'll do bargain basement shopping. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And Washington ends up just settling for basically Chris Paul, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=23.28s)]
*  Shamett and between three and 37 second round picks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=26.44s)]
*  Where do you want to start? You take us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=31.0s)]
*  Let's start with this. I think it's stupid for Phoenix. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=35.0s)]
*  And I think the other part that we have to get into that we can spend some time [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=37.84s)]
*  on is also who Beale is, right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=40.64s)]
*  It's like trying to talk through what we all think of Beale in the NBA as he [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=43.6s)]
*  turns 30 later this month. But the first part of this is, you know, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=47.94s)]
*  I know like the way we've talked about super teams is that I, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  I felt like that was the norm. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=55.04s)]
*  So whoever was building a team had to deal with Miami, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=56.64s)]
*  They had to deal with Golden State. They had to deal with Cleveland. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=61.4s)]
*  The Lakers part of their run of winning it with AD and LeBron a few years ago, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=64.72s)]
*  a big part of that story all season long was when are they getting their third [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  guy? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=72.88s)]
*  Because we were just conditioned to believe that whoever was the NBA favorite [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=73.36s)]
*  had to be a big three. And what happened is it just kind of stopped. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=77.12s)]
*  It just stopped. Even though other teams were trying to do it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Certainly Brooklyn was trying to do it two different times. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  It felt like Philly was, was flirting with the idea. But we really didn't have it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=86.84s)]
*  It stopped because the league got too talented. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=91.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  it's too hard to just have three guys and do the 2012 Miami Heat model. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  Basically you can't do it. I don't think in this day and age. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=99.16s)]
*  Right. And I think like there could be some argument to adding Drew Holliday to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=101.72s)]
*  Middleton and Giannis, maybe, you know, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=104.72s)]
*  Chris Paul towards the end when they were in the finals a couple of years ago, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=107.64s)]
*  losing to Milwaukee with he Booker and then Aitin. I mean, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=110.64s)]
*  that doesn't seem all that accurate. Right. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=113.48s)]
*  So I felt like we always watched going, well, who's, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=114.88s)]
*  who's the next team that's going to add that third guy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=118.4s)]
*  And what we've seen recently now is that we have these championships because [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=120.8s)]
*  there is no other team. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=123.72s)]
*  There isn't a team with the established three guys that obviously the best [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=124.92s)]
*  versions of it are Miami, Golden state, and then probably that second Cleveland [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=128.72s)]
*  run. So the other part is that like with Jokic having this run, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=132.04s)]
*  I think a lot of dumb things are being said being like, that's the way to do it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=137.04s)]
*  It's like, yeah, if you have Jokic, it's the way to do it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=139.88s)]
*  Like it's so dismissive of who Jokic is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  So if we just start from the Phoenix part of this, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=145.4s)]
*  even though the price is nothing, as you astutely point out, the no trade thing, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=148.6s)]
*  you know, I don't know if the market was going to be that hot form without a no [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=153.4s)]
*  trade. This package coming back feels like it's atrocious for Washington, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  but the Phoenix part of this to now have these four guys, including Aitin, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=160.24s)]
*  knowing that a Booker extension is coming in another year, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=165.12s)]
*  the tax apron stuff that we covered where it's almost like the closest we've ever [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=168.4s)]
*  been to a hard cap. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=172.44s)]
*  Beal's not the guy to lock yourself into this kind of financial commitment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=175.04s)]
*  You and I did not text about this because I wanted, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=180.44s)]
*  I figured we'd be somewhat aligned. I just don't like the trade for Phoenix. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=183.08s)]
*  And I know in a vacuum you can go, well, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=187.24s)]
*  look what we gave up and look what we got back. Sure. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=188.96s)]
*  If you look at just like, if we're putting together big threes, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=193.96s)]
*  how the teams put them together since 2008 when the Celtics kind of were the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=197.2s)]
*  first one to go really on the map with it with the KG and Paul Pierce and Ray [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=201.2s)]
*  Allen. And they were like, big three. And the way they built those three together, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=204.76s)]
*  all those three guys complimented each other. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  And then we've had different variations of it over the years. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  Brooklyn was probably the weirdest where they put the rant and harden and Kyrie [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  together and they're like, we're just going to outscore everybody. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=218.04s)]
*  Our offense is going to be unbelievable. And we saw it for about two weeks. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=219.88s)]
*  And then they had injuries and we never saw it again. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=223.44s)]
*  And just to jump in on the nets, would you agree that had they all been healthy, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=225.88s)]
*  I still think that team would have been in contender, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=230.0s)]
*  despite what I think of some of the dudes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=231.76s)]
*  Yeah. Which will be the case with Phoenix. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=234.16s)]
*  I just don't love how the three guys compliment each other. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=236.92s)]
*  And I think you and I both feel like Beale is overrated as an asset, but you know, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=239.12s)]
*  this puts an incredible burden on Durant. He's going to have to be basically, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=243.88s)]
*  I guess, I think the lead wing defender on this team, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=248.0s)]
*  maybe even like a chip and rim protector guy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  One of these guys, either Durant or Booker is going to have to be the facilitator. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=254.44s)]
*  And we've seen this over and over again, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=258.28s)]
*  when you put these three high usage rate guys together, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=259.76s)]
*  the usage rate can only add up to a hundred percent, right? It just, by rule, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=263.36s)]
*  you can only get to a hundred. So if you have three guys who are like, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=269.08s)]
*  I'm usually 38, well, I'm usually 35. Well, I'm usually 36. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=272.28s)]
*  Somebody's going to suffer. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=276.48s)]
*  We even saw Curry is one of the best teammates of the last 30 years when that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  first warrior season got a little rocky there around Christmas. So it was like, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  man, I'm barely being used. And then they kind of navigated it and figured it out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=285.16s)]
*  I just think somebody's going to be unhappy out of these three guys. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's probably going to be Beale, which I'm going to throw it back to you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  Goes back to how good is Bradley Beale? Are we sure he's that good? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=296.12s)]
*  If he's your third guy, okay. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=300.76s)]
*  But is your third guy with two other score first offensive players kind of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=305.0s)]
*  creator need the ball at the time guy now? What am I getting with him? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  He's going to stand in the corner. Who's going to set him up? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=313.04s)]
*  Is he going to be happy? He scored 30 points a game. Like what? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=315.88s)]
*  Three years ago, he hit the ball all the time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=319.76s)]
*  He's not going to have the ball all the time now. Telling you that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  So I don't see how he's happy with this. Plus he's making 50 million a year. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=324.8s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you pointed out like in a vacuum, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=329.68s)]
*  when you look at the pieces going out, Chris Paul, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=332.48s)]
*  who's guaranteed 15 million if you wave them by June 28th. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=334.52000000000004s)]
*  And it sounds like he's going to be rerouted somewhere anyway. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=337.76s)]
*  Then you've got 10 million on the books for sham it next year. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=340.36s)]
*  And the second rounders, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=343.48s)]
*  which we still aren't quite sure how it's all going to shake out and the pick [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=345.24s)]
*  swap. Like if you look at that for Brad, even if you don't like Bradley Beale, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=348.76s)]
*  you're like, okay, well give me a break. Like I'll do that because this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=351.88s)]
*  Right. Right. But for Phoenix, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=356.4s)]
*  for Phoenix to then lock yourselves in this way, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  and then let's get to it. Like I'm, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=363.92s)]
*  I'm shocked the pushback I got this week from like pointing out that Beale doesn't [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  play nearly as much as you think he does. And then it was like, okay, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  well there was the COVID stuff and they were shorter seasons and you know, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=373.08s)]
*  they were tanking and all these different things. You're like, okay, fine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=376.35999999999996s)]
*  Let's do it this way. For his career, he's missed 19% of his games. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  He hasn't turned 30 yet. Again, he turns 30 at the end of this month. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=383.4s)]
*  The last four seasons he's missed 33% of the games. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=386.4s)]
*  His first five seasons he was about 39 to 40% from three. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  The last five seasons, 36 and a half, 30, 35, 35, 35. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=394.12s)]
*  So he's basically 35. But if you look at him on [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=398.32s)]
*  his 34% range from three in the last three seasons [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=403.72s)]
*  of all the players in the league with 800 or more attempts, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=408.76s)]
*  which he is over three seasons, his 34% ranks 100 out of 109. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=411.92s)]
*  I went through synergy numbers this morning and I looked at his catch and shoot [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=417.0s)]
*  stuff because now we're going to be looking at somebody who just because of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=419.88s)]
*  Booker's amazing, like I am as high on Booker as I've ever been. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=422.28s)]
*  I still think Durant figures it out some way, even though, you know, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=425.67999999999995s)]
*  I didn't love a lot of the stuff I saw. We know his injury concerns going forward. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  But when I look at Beal on the catch and shoot stuff, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=433.96s)]
*  for the most part, when you look at the points per shot efficiency, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  he's an average player. The free throws have gone down. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=440.91999999999996s)]
*  The rebounding has always gone down. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=444.08s)]
*  And I always feel like those years where he had 30 plus a game back to back years, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=445.76s)]
*  he was top five in usage in the NBA those two seasons, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=449.32s)]
*  and he's not going to get to do that. So of course he can score. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=452.32s)]
*  Of course, there's like another level to his shot creation that you just don't [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=455.64s)]
*  get in a lot of players in the league. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=458.8s)]
*  But if he's going to be a ball stopping guy while Booker and Durant are watching him, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=460.68s)]
*  it doesn't make a lot of sense to me other than that there's a brand new owner [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=466.56s)]
*  going like, look what I did. And you're like, okay. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=470.76s)]
*  You know, I'm just not a fan of it because now this is who you are for like [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  three or four years too. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=478.64s)]
*  Yeah. There's a Bradley Beal, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=480.76s)]
*  I think in people's heads versus the Bradley Beal that's actually existed the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  last couple of years. Like when he averaged a 30 a game, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=485.32s)]
*  he just had the ball all the time. I had a house who, you know, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=487.56s)]
*  has been my friend for 35 years who's come on this pod and talked about Bill a [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=491.0s)]
*  bunch. It's just like, this is not an end of the game guy. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  If he's your number one guy, you're going nowhere. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=497.4s)]
*  If he's in the Ray Allen 2008 role, Ray Allen was just a way better shooter. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=500.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, and Ray Allen was somebody who didn't need the ball a lot. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=506.76s)]
*  It still have a huge impact on the game. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=509.52s)]
*  We haven't really seen that version of Bill at all. And he's also not like, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=511.0s)]
*  he's not an above average defensive player. I would say he, where would you put him? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=514.92s)]
*  Would you put him average or below average? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=518.72s)]
*  I'd say below average his box score plus minus, which again, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=520.6s)]
*  doesn't tell everything, especially in a team that hasn't been all that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=523.6s)]
*  competitive, but he's been a negative defensive box score plus minus nine of his [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=525.76s)]
*  11 seasons. But you know, the funny thing about like anybody. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=530.04s)]
*  And then get to the, and then get to the, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=532.92s)]
*  the passing and can he create shots for other guys? That's not really there either. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=534.8399999999999s)]
*  So it's somebody that he's basically a score first guy that I wouldn't put him [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=539.28s)]
*  above average in really any other category. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=543.64s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, in this year alone, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know how it shook out the other years because it was something I was [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=548.4s)]
*  always looking at with Harden and Embiid, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=550.8s)]
*  but in turnovers per however many possessions during clutch time, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=552.92s)]
*  Bill led the lead. Like he was, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=557.36s)]
*  he was the most turnover prone guy in clutch moments in those games. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=559.04s)]
*  So, you know, this isn't, this isn't to say that like, nobody's saying he sucks. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=562.2s)]
*  It's that I, if I'm an owner and you don't get to pay a money to just a guys, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=567.5600000000001s)]
*  you don't, it's not the way the league works. Like we look at these contracts, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=573.8000000000001s)]
*  we're like, I can't believe this guy got this guy and like, yeah, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=576.44s)]
*  but it's the fear of not having anything is why you're paying a premium on the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  players aren't necessarily a premium guy, but for Beal to turn 30, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  to, to not be a dude that laces them up all the time. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it was just him in Washington and he was the good guy and [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=590.76s)]
*  everything sucked around him. But you know, when you're the number one guy, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  like I'd like you to flirt with the playoffs a little bit more, like a little bit more. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=597.3599999999999s)]
*  I think that team was, was a little bit better talent wise than the record. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=600.64s)]
*  Porzingis had a really good year for what you would expect from a Porzingis year [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  last year. Kuzma was like a borderline all star for most of that year. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=608.8s)]
*  And if you look at their bench guys, like I liked Danny Avdodja. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=613.12s)]
*  I thought he actually has a role guy was pretty good. Kispert think shot like what? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=616.1999999999999s)]
*  42, 43% from three. He's not a bust. Their point guards weren't great, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=620.28s)]
*  but for the most part they were in the mix. They were 500, you know, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  January and February and looked like they were going to at least be a playing [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=629.36s)]
*  team. And they never got there. He hasn't really, he missed a lot of games. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=632.4399999999999s)]
*  He missed a lot of games, but he hasn't really, you know, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=636.76s)]
*  in 2017 when they almost beat the Celtics and the Kelly Olympic game, game seven, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=639.48s)]
*  and they should have, they were a much better team than that Celtics team. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=643.48s)]
*  And the, one of the reasons they lost was the Celtics just basically, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=647.04s)]
*  they figured out John Wall wasn't shooting threes well. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  And they basically put the series in his hand and was daring him to shoot threes. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=654.04s)]
*  Beal I thought played pretty well. He didn't shoot that great from three in the playoffs, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=657.24s)]
*  but I thought for the most part he was laying the groundwork for like, Oh, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=660.88s)]
*  this guy, there's something here. I just don't know as a third guy. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=664.6s)]
*  Like we just learned this with Denver. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=668.76s)]
*  Denver had their three best guys complimenting each other so well. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=670.96s)]
*  And Gordon was third guy. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=674.4000000000001s)]
*  Gordon's not as good as Bradley Beal on paper from a talent standpoint, right? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=675.32s)]
*  If you're in a fantasy basketball draft, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=679.5200000000001s)]
*  you're taking Bradley Beal before Aaron Gordon, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=681.7600000000001s)]
*  but Aaron Gordon is a much more impactful basketball player on both ends than [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=683.5600000000001s)]
*  Bradley Beal is. And that was one of the reasons I thought that Denver, I mean, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=687.2s)]
*  Yocage is the key reason, but I just, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=690.5200000000001s)]
*  I look at all the moves that Phoenix made and there's Chris Paul stuff to get [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=694.2s)]
*  through and there's Washington stuff to get to that we can do after the break. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  But I look at all the stuff Phoenix had, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=700.7600000000001s)]
*  and I almost like this trait more if they hadn't done the KD trade. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=702.48s)]
*  Like if they still had Mikhail Bridges and they still had Cam Johnson, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=706.2s)]
*  they still had all their firsts. And then they're like, Hey man, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=709.96s)]
*  we just stole Bradley Beal. Like, right. We barely gave up anything for him. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=712.88s)]
*  And Booker and Beal are going to be our two high-priced guys. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=716.52s)]
*  We have Mikhail Bridges on this awesome contract. We still have our picks. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=718.84s)]
*  We have Aitin. There's one more move to be had, but we just, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=722.72s)]
*  we couldn't resist just grabbing Beal here. I liked, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=725.44s)]
*  I liked the team more if it was that. With this one, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=728.76s)]
*  if it was that. With this where it's like, Hey, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=731.4s)]
*  we have these three super expensive guys. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=733.48s)]
*  The second Abrams is going to murder them. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=735.92s)]
*  They're going to really have to rely on the goodwill of guys just being like, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  all right, I'll play for 1.6 just to try to win a title. If I'm doing that, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=740.64s)]
*  I'd rather play with Denver. I'd rather be on Jokic's team. You know, so, um, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=744.84s)]
*  we talked about new owner syndrome a lot. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=750.24s)]
*  This is the most new owner syndrome-y guy we've had in a long time. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=752.6s)]
*  And one of his lead advisors is Isaiah Thomas. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=756.96s)]
*  When Isaiah Thomas likes to zag, he did this with the Knicks in mid 2000s, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=759.68s)]
*  when everyone else was trying to get smaller and small ball and shooting and, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  you know, that the league was starting to shift a different way. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=768.8s)]
*  And he was like, I'm going to get bigger. He said this, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=771.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to get Zach Randolph. I'm going to get Eddie Curry. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  We're going to bully teams. We're going to play bigger. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=775.52s)]
*  We're going to pound them. And he wanted to zag. And this to me, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=777.7199999999999s)]
*  it feels like a zag where they're in the sun's, you know, brain trust thing. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=780.88s)]
*  And they're like, how do we get better? How do we get better? It's like, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=785.4s)]
*  we just got to outscore everybody. We'll get Bradley Beale. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=787.68s)]
*  How are they going to stop us with these three guys? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  I actually think it'll be a little easier to stop them than maybe they realize. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, they didn't have depth this past year, right? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=796.8s)]
*  Depth was an issue before this happened. Like they always needed another point [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=799.9599999999999s)]
*  guard, I thought, to just make it easier on Chris Paul. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=803.52s)]
*  So he could be healthier later in the year. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=806.16s)]
*  That's something I thought they should have had for years. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=807.8s)]
*  They didn't even have another big in that Milwaukee matchup, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=810.12s)]
*  which may have cost them a title in 21 because they just didn't have another. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=812.4799999999999s)]
*  So this depth thing has been an issue when it wasn't like this. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=815.4000000000001s)]
*  And now you're going to have these four guys making this kind of money. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=819.2s)]
*  They have rights on two other players. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=821.7600000000001s)]
*  Do we think Aitin's on this team in two weeks? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=824.36s)]
*  Because I would say no, I would say this would be step A and step B [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=827.84s)]
*  is some sort of Aitin for multiple players trade. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=831.6s)]
*  But like what you just said, if we watch that Denver [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=834.2800000000001s)]
*  Phoenix series that happened a month ago and you put Bradley Beale in the shim [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=837.96s)]
*  at spot, is that series different? Because I don't think it is. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't I don't know how Beale changes the destiny of them [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=845.88s)]
*  because they couldn't get stops. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=848.6800000000001s)]
*  They had no depth like Denver was just basically, you know, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=850.36s)]
*  I don't even think that series should have gone six. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=853.2s)]
*  You had this historic fluke event of an 86 point game from two guys. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=855.0s)]
*  I don't know how Beale changes the destiny of that series. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=859.84s)]
*  I just think it's so risky, man. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=865.1600000000001s)]
*  I think it's so risky. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=866.88s)]
*  And Beale is not somebody I'd want to pay this much money to. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=868.44s)]
*  He's just he's just not. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=873.2800000000001s)]
*  Now, maybe he's energized. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=874.4s)]
*  You know, like the Wizards stuff is weird because, yeah, you can blame wall. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=875.8s)]
*  You can blame the front office. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=879.72s)]
*  You can blame a bunch of different things. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=881.8s)]
*  I mean, the coaching thing, whatever, they tried a bunch of different deals. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  But like, if you're truly that guy, which none of us ever have thought, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=885.64s)]
*  like we never talked about Beale as a top 10 guy. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=891.28s)]
*  I don't even know if he's top 20. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=893.1999999999999s)]
*  And you're like, OK, can you can you at least flirt with. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=895.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, always being in the back end, the contention for the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=900.52s)]
*  playoff spot in the East. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=902.84s)]
*  And so I wonder, you know, I wonder how many people would feel like, well, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=905.48s)]
*  maybe the reason the team wasn't all the competitive is because their [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=907.96s)]
*  number one guy was Beale. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=910.48s)]
*  So, like, he's going to score. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=911.6s)]
*  He's going to have some huge nights. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=913.64s)]
*  I can already see the headlines, like three games into the season. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=915.0s)]
*  He goes for like 35 and it's like, oh, it's going so well. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=917.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=920.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=921.2s)]
*  But he'll talk to me in four years when he's $57 million. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  So I, I think with the new CBA apron stuff, like this felt like a deal. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=924.2s)]
*  Like, I don't know that I would have liked it in the previous CBA, but you [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  throw it into the new one, you throw it into the new one and you're like, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=933.32s)]
*  did you guys not get the email? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=936.9200000000001s)]
*  Like, did you not get it? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=938.96s)]
*  And I love that you brought up the Isaiah part of it because Isaiah's biggest [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=939.8000000000001s)]
*  thing with the Knicks is he couldn't stop himself from trading for bad contracts. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  Like he never cared. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=946.1600000000001s)]
*  I'll never forget listening to him on Mike and the Mad Dog where dog was like, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=947.08s)]
*  you know, I'm not going to do the impersonation, but he's like, you keep [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=951.1600000000001s)]
*  trading for these contracts. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=953.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Isaiah, you keep getting these, these expensive guys. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=955.24s)]
*  I just don't know what you're going to do with them. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=958.08s)]
*  Steve France is 17 million. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=959.68s)]
*  Isaiah and Isaiah was like, yeah, but what you don't realize is that those [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=961.0s)]
*  contracts expire and they're valuable. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=964.88s)]
*  And like, it was the weirdest defense of it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=967.4799999999999s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no, I'm just going to keep taking everybody's bad contracts [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=970.28s)]
*  because one day they expire and you were like, what? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  Like anybody with any like entry level understanding of how salaries work in [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=976.8399999999999s)]
*  the league was like, wait, that's, that's your position. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=981.3199999999999s)]
*  And so far, like, look, Durant, Durant gets hurt all the time. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=984.7199999999999s)]
*  Durant's really expensive, you know, Durant, but he's still Durant. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=988.4s)]
*  Maybe not peak Durant, but he's still Kevin Durant. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=993.84s)]
*  That one I understood, even though that price retroactively looks exorbitant. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=996.92s)]
*  Uh, I, I wouldn't want this tax bill. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1002.52s)]
*  I wouldn't want this tax bill. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1005.24s)]
*  Like I would need more assurances that I feel like I'm easily top, like without [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1006.16s)]
*  question, top three in the West to do something like this. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1010.0s)]
*  And I don't know that. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1012.48s)]
*  And again, yeah, you're right. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  There's still moves to come. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1014.12s)]
*  We did last week, we did the, I wouldn't be surprised if you were another team in [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1014.96s)]
*  August draft and we both had Beale number one, we went through the salary, which was [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1018.0400000000001s)]
*  46.7 this upcoming season, 50.2 in 24, 25, 53.7 the next year. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1022.44s)]
*  And then player option 57.1, 26, 27. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1030.08s)]
*  You want to do your joke? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1034.0s)]
*  I think we'll probably pick that year up. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1036.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1037.88s)]
*  I'm going to break that now. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1038.92s)]
*  It's, uh, it's just been a staggering one. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1040.8s)]
*  It's just been a staggering amount of money. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1043.8s)]
*  The one thing I would love to find out now that he waved his no trade clause, is [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1045.36s)]
*  that wave forever? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1049.12s)]
*  No, no, he still has, he still have it. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1053.08s)]
*  And then I'm glad you brought up the Durant thing because he got hurt twice last [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1055.7199999999998s)]
*  year and he's had, he's had some major injuries, major injuries. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1059.24s)]
*  He's he's had a Jones fracture in his foot. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1065.76s)]
*  He tore his Achilles. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1068.8s)]
*  He's had his knee operated on in different ways, multiple times. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1070.48s)]
*  He's seven feet tall. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1074.1200000000001s)]
*  He's been playing basketball since 07. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1075.4s)]
*  We've been talking about Jeff Green, your guy, congrats by the way, uh, got his [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1078.04s)]
*  title and it's been a lot of Jeff Green, the old veteran. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1082.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1086.44s)]
*  Jeff Green's been on so many teams. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1087.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  The old guy finally did it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1090.04s)]
*  Um, he was in the same draft as Kevin Durant. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1091.68s)]
*  He's two years older, but same draft. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1093.72s)]
*  So, you know, I just think cause Durant other than like his hair is going a [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1096.52s)]
*  little bit, but he looks the same. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1100.6399999999999s)]
*  He always looks the same. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1102.84s)]
*  You know, it's like when Hulk Hogan in the early 2000s still looked like Hulk [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1104.72s)]
*  Hogan, but it wasn't Hulk Hogan anymore. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1107.8799999999999s)]
*  I, at some point that Durant thing, he's going to not be one of the top seven [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1109.8799999999999s)]
*  guys in the league anymore. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1113.8s)]
*  And a lot of this is going to go on Booker. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1114.8s)]
*  I, to me is if Beal can come back and his threes can go way up again, maybe [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1116.32s)]
*  we'll feel differently about this trade. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1122.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1123.56s)]
*  We got to take a break. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1123.76s)]
*  We got a hammer Washington. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1125.04s)]
*  I really want to bring the, uh, not even a small hammer out. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1126.4399999999998s)]
*  I want to bring an ice pick camera out and really go, go at them. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1129.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1132.56s)]
*  But I have one, when we come back, I have one question for you. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1132.8s)]
*  Cause I could go on the Beal thing. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1135.76s)]
*  Like there's just so many parts of this that are so interesting. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1137.52s)]
*  I still think there's more meat on the Phoenix bone, but I have a specific [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1139.6399999999999s)]
*  Beal 2000 Celtics, 2008 Celtics. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1142.32s)]
*  Cause I know we rarely bring up the 08 Celtics on the pod. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1145.28s)]
*  So I just want to make sure we do that. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1147.76s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1148.9199999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1149.52s)]
*  Give me your 08 Celtics Beal analogy before we move on to the pathetic, uh, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1149.7199999999998s)]
*  Washington team. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1153.36s)]
*  Um, were you surprised at the Celtics version of Ray Allen that first year? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1155.1599999999999s)]
*  Yes, because, um, he had battled injuries and was in a pretty bad Seattle [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1163.0s)]
*  situation that year before. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1169.7199999999998s)]
*  And I remember when they made the trade, I've talked about this. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1172.1999999999998s)]
*  I was upset because I didn't get it. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1176.0s)]
*  I was like, even if he's healthy again, where does Ray Allen and Paul [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1177.7199999999998s)]
*  Pierce take us and then they had the KG trade coming, but I thought he really [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1180.56s)]
*  reinvented himself, you know, some guys do this, like even somebody as great as [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1184.2s)]
*  Kobe, there was still a reinvention with him. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1188.92s)]
*  He added this whole 2008 to 2013 stretch of his superstar career that really made [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1191.0800000000002s)]
*  the career special, like the way he was able to tweak his game, add stuff, add [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1197.56s)]
*  the little fall away and, um, just kind of change how we played for the better in a [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1203.68s)]
*  lot of ways, um, elevated his career. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1208.56s)]
*  I felt like Ray Allen was a junior version of that. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1211.52s)]
*  He learned how to not have the ball at the time and still have huge impacts in [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1214.24s)]
*  games and he ended up, you know, he goes all the way through basically through [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1217.44s)]
*  Miami in 2014, but you know, had seven pretty meaningful years there. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1221.28s)]
*  I'm really good teams. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1225.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if Bill has that in him. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1227.16s)]
*  I I'm not ruling it out by the way. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1228.64s)]
*  Are you like, he might, he might have it in him. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1230.04s)]
*  I wouldn't cross it off. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1232.16s)]
*  Look, there's part of me as I've looked at this going, what if he's motivated by [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1235.0s)]
*  this and, you know, knowing he was never a number one and then going like, I don't [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1238.44s)]
*  even think he's a two on a title contender. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1241.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, here you go. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1243.68s)]
*  Like a two, better, what better spot to be a three with this group. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1244.76s)]
*  And you're going to get to be the number one option in those games or Durant's gone. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1248.0s)]
*  Uh, you're right, because there's still some TBD on the rest of this stuff with [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1251.4s)]
*  eight and where it may be the rare trade that usually I don't like where you're [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1255.0s)]
*  trading the most talented player for three pieces, but they're kind of in need [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1257.8400000000001s)]
*  of that and I don't want Booker to play point guard the whole time. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1261.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't want Booker's drives to be taken away from him. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1264.52s)]
*  I want him, I want him driving the way I saw him drive this year that to me, like [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1266.8400000000001s)]
*  puts him at a whole nother level. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1271.28s)]
*  Like I'm just, I'm so in on him and his mentality and everything. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1272.52s)]
*  Like he's one of the few guys that loses in the second round for a team. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1275.84s)]
*  It seems like it's going in the wrong direction where I'm like, I'm more in on [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1278.68s)]
*  them now than ever before, so I don't want anything to interfere with that. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1281.16s)]
*  But the reason I asked the Ray Allen question was that I think it was almost [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1284.24s)]
*  always kind of surprising for us because he thought, Hey, he's such a great shooter. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1287.28s)]
*  But he wasn't really a catch and shoot guy because he was always used to kind of [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1292.28s)]
*  working off the ball a little bit more. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1296.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1298.04s)]
*  Um, and I mean it like in the way we kind of define catch and shoot now where it's [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1298.44s)]
*  like, you never move and you sit there and just wait. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1302.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1305.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1306.64s)]
*  Even though Seth can do a little bit more. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1307.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1310.16s)]
*  But I thought it was way harder for Ray Allen than the other two guys. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1310.44s)]
*  And it was, it was, it felt like a strength. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1316.2800000000002s)]
*  Then he's taken like eight less shots per game. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1318.3600000000001s)]
*  And yet he's still at like 17 a game. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1321.0s)]
*  He's still like almost 40% from three. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1322.6000000000001s)]
*  So the numbers tell you, Oh, he just took less shots. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1324.8000000000002s)]
*  But I thought it was like a real, a real, like, I don't know. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1327.6000000000001s)]
*  I just think he deserved a lot of credit for, it could have been a lot of fun all [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1332.8s)]
*  the time, but there was a greater good there. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1337.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1339.52s)]
*  It was, it was the goal of the team. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1339.88s)]
*  And the other part of that team was that the three guys we've already brought this [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1341.4s)]
*  up too many times is they were all collectively over the individual part of it. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1344.16s)]
*  They were old enough in their career. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1347.8400000000001s)]
*  They'd been through their old failures. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  So yeah, I guess there's part of me that wonders like, can Beal go in going, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1350.6000000000001s)]
*  all right, dude, I've done a decade. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1354.0800000000002s)]
*  I've got the money. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1355.32s)]
*  I've got everything. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't have any of the accolades. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1357.52s)]
*  I've never done anything with the team. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1358.96s)]
*  Like I need to find a way. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1360.8400000000001s)]
*  He is talented enough. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1362.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't think any of us deny that he is talented enough. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1363.8s)]
*  I would think to find a way to fit in where it's not at the detriment of the other [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1367.04s)]
*  guys, but if he's going to do ball stopping ISO shit and not make threes and then, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1370.76s)]
*  you know, be less available post 30, unless that's all wizards related. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1378.68s)]
*  It's just, I try to kind of see the other side of something, even if I, if I don't [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1384.32s)]
*  necessarily believe it, but there's going to have to be some real sacrifice from [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1388.6000000000001s)]
*  him of adapting his game around it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1392.04s)]
*  And I wonder, I don't know. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1393.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if that's in his makeup or not. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1395.96s)]
*  Ray Allen in 2007 on Seattle, his usage rate was 29 and a half. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1399.76s)]
*  And he went to Boston. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1405.92s)]
*  It was 21.6, 20.8, 20.2 the next three years. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1406.8s)]
*  Even if you look at field goal attempts, he was 21 a game in Seattle and oh seven [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1411.72s)]
*  was 13 and a half a game in Boston and oh eight. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1416.92s)]
*  That's a huge sacrifice. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1419.8400000000001s)]
*  And you mentioned, you know, the, the bill, like, is he ready to sacrifice [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1421.64s)]
*  at this point in his career? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1426.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we just saw him take a crazy contract from Washington and a team that [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1427.3200000000002s)]
*  he was going nowhere because it was a money decision. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  That was it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1433.48s)]
*  So that always makes me dubious. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1434.28s)]
*  I think there's real red flags with him. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1436.1200000000001s)]
*  Just from, if you go, just go look at everyone on basketball reference. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1438.92s)]
*  I always make this point. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1442.0s)]
*  Basketball reference 78, 79 year history of basketball at this point. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1443.48s)]
*  And go look at the stats, go look at when people peak. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1448.72s)]
*  Like Bill had those two straight years in the thirties when it drops to 23 and [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1451.28s)]
*  23 the next two years, the history of basketball says that's usually a bad sign. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1456.52s)]
*  You kind of end up where you are. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1460.92s)]
*  Like Germain O'Neal was the best example of this. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1462.2s)]
*  He was like a 20 and 10 guy. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1465.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he was like a 13 and eight guy. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1466.6000000000001s)]
*  And it's like, Oh, and then teams started trading for him. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1468.52s)]
*  Well, we'll get him back. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1471.0s)]
*  And then it's like, now this is kind of where he is now. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1471.76s)]
*  We'll hear stuff. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1474.4s)]
*  Cause we hear this every year about the sons are going to stagger these guys. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1475.52s)]
*  And you know, they'll always have be able to have two of them on the court. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1479.44s)]
*  And it's going to be great. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1482.96s)]
*  And here's all the ways it's going to work. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1483.96s)]
*  But I'm sorry, basketball comes down to the last eight minutes. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1486.44s)]
*  We just watched that nuggets Lakers series. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1489.0800000000002s)]
*  I bet the Lakers were the second best team in the league. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1490.8400000000001s)]
*  Every one of those games came down to the last eight minutes and my five [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1493.12s)]
*  against your five and who are we playing? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1496.04s)]
*  And so we can do this whole stagger thing and maybe that'll help them [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1498.24s)]
*  in the regular season, but ultimately it's going to come down to your best five guys. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1500.84s)]
*  Do you have, can Beale or Booker guard the other team's best, you know, creator [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1504.6399999999999s)]
*  slash who's guarding Shay Gilgis Alexander in round one. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1510.2s)]
*  Is it Booker? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1514.3999999999999s)]
*  Is it Beale? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1516.04s)]
*  It's Booker right now. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1516.96s)]
*  Is it, is it free agent? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1518.32s)]
*  Um, $1.6 million guy. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1520.24s)]
*  You know, who's guarding Jason Tatum in the finals. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1523.1599999999999s)]
*  Is it Durant? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1525.52s)]
*  That's so I just think this team has real holes still. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1527.1599999999999s)]
*  I think we both agree. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1530.2s)]
*  Yeah, cool. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1531.1599999999999s)]
*  If you can get Bradley Beale for what you got on paper, it makes a ton of sense. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1532.12s)]
*  But the contract is terrifying. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1535.36s)]
*  It's terrifying because you have no outs now. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1538.72s)]
*  And this is, we've talked about this before with Go Bear, the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1541.96s)]
*  Go Bear trade and other ones. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1544.48s)]
*  I don't like trades where I have no outs. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1546.24s)]
*  Like this is it. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  I am fucking in now. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1549.76s)]
*  My out now is like basically a Devon Booker trade, which I'm never doing. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1551.28s)]
*  And if Durant doesn't work on the sons team, he's not going to have nearly [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1555.4s)]
*  the value of what he gave up. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1559.0s)]
*  And then the Beale thing, maybe this was his value. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1561.04s)]
*  Like I thought it was interesting. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1564.08s)]
*  Miami didn't want him. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1565.08s)]
*  Miami could have beaten this trade. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1565.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1568.6s)]
*  They could have traded a hero and two picks for him. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1568.96s)]
*  Probably could have gotten Lowry and two picks for him. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1571.48s)]
*  They didn't want him. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1574.08s)]
*  Uh, I wonder if the, if the hero part of it was that the wizards go like, look, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1575.1200000000001s)]
*  we just don't want, we don't want the rest of the hero money. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1578.52s)]
*  Which is still significant. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1581.28s)]
*  I mean, he got the four year, $120 million contract and it was all guaranteed. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1582.72s)]
*  Well, would you rather add Lowry and two firsts than what they got back? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1586.44s)]
*  I would have. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1590.76s)]
*  Well, two firsts. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1591.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1592.36s)]
*  I mean, the funniest thing about doing this deal with Phoenix is you couldn't [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1592.52s)]
*  even get like this deal of Phoenix hasn't spent all their firsts on Durant. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1594.84s)]
*  It has two firsts in it. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1599.56s)]
*  Like it probably just has two firsts in it. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1601.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1603.48s)]
*  Cause they're like, come on, just give us two. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1603.68s)]
*  We'll put some protections on them. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-muMW2J4k&t=1605.28s)]
