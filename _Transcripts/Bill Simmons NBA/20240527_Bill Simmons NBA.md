# Why the Mavs Are Up 3-0 on the Wolves | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [May 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD6Ym7qtlVc)
*  Just watched Dallas beat Minnesota.
*  They're up three nothing.
*  The Celtics are also up three nothing.
*  And it looks like we're going to have a Celtics, Mavs, finals, barring one of the
*  great comebacks in the history of professional sports.
*  Where do you want to start with, Silo?
*  We have to start with Dallas because this is the most impressive thing I think that
*  has happened, even though Minnesota taking out Denver, you're like, they're really
*  going to go in there and beat Denver at their place in game seven.
*  And then they do that.
*  And yet here we have two teams that I do think are close, but just the mastery of
*  Luca.
*  And we already know what's about to happen.
*  I know we're going to talk about another pod today, but you know, there's a reason
*  why over the course of these years where I'm like, if you just want the ball in
*  somebody's hands in the biggest moment, I don't know why you pick anybody other
*  than Luca.
*  And it's not just the made three against go bear in game two.
*  He just, it feels like it's impossible when he's cooking and he just dropped and
*  emptied the entire toolbox on this team.
*  Again, there's all these different plays.
*  There's a bunch of different reasons.
*  This series is three Oh, but Lucas, the best player that's still alive.
*  We knew that when we ranked him coming out of it.
*  And I just think it has to be a lot of praise for Dallas to start this because
*  this is so incredible.
*  Well, now it's starting to feel like the best player alive championship belt
*  doesn't play because if Luca, if Luca keeps going here and then beats Boston in
*  the finals, Yoko just like, he just, he just found a place for it in his living
*  room, right?
*  Like right above the TV.
*  He just cleared a cabinet out.
*  He just put it in there and then he's like, wait, what I'm losing this.
*  Uh, if Luca went, if Luca pulls this off, he's going to be the best part in the
*  league.
*  It's, and it's crazy cause I'm the same person who said a couple of months ago,
*  I thought the distance between Yoko and everybody else was as significant as
*  this is Justin Termini's point first, but as significant as anybody since
*  LeBron in 2013, but you look at, uh, you look at Dallas here, 16 and four to end
*  the season, 11 and four in the playoffs, getting better as the playoffs go along.
*  And it's now hitting the point where you almost feel like they're like the
*  freaking Yankees in the late nineties, where it's like, if this is a close game
*  in the eighth inning, you're probably going to lose.
*  This is how it's going to play out.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's do the belt thing.
*  Can we hold off on that?
*  We'll put it later.
*  I just feel like there've been a lot of belt transfers in a very short amount of
*  time, and that's a topic in itself, but the closer arguments perfect because.
*  You know, this is kind of by design when everything's supposed to work out.
*  It's like, okay, can you have two people that can get their own shots in these
*  impossible moments at the end of playoff games when everything else is falling
*  apart?
*  Do you have two players?
*  They can get you good looks.
*  And I would have never wanted to be in the Kyrie business.
*  I don't think anybody pushing back into the time is wrong, even though that's
*  kind of the way it plays out.
*  But even tonight, there was a play where, you know, they were debating on the
*  broadcast, like what to do with Luca, need more doubles, more of the debate
*  carry over at the end of game two against go bear.
*  And, you know, it just sounds better to be like, Hey, double, he's got to double
*  more.
*  You're going to keep two with them.
*  And I'm not, I'm not saying that you shouldn't be looking to just cheat off of
*  somebody else, but it's not like Luca isn't going to figure that part of it out.
*  He brought up Gafford for a screen and I was waiting to see are two going to stay
*  with Luca off of the Gafford thing because Gafford instead of lively is a
*  downgrade for Dallas because he's not the pastor that lively is, which is one of
*  the most remarkable things about how this team is built, that this kid's a rookie
*  and he's making like the right reads and big, big stakes playoff games.
*  So as the screen is about to be set with Gafford, Luca knows exactly what he's
*  going to do.
*  He swings at the Kyrie who kicks the PJ Washington in the corner and PJ hits like
*  one of the biggest shots of the game.
*  That three.
*  And it looks like it was one oh four, one oh four when that happened.
*  It looked like it wasn't really that big of a deal.
*  And in reality, Luca was like, Oh, you think you're going to like trick me?
*  Yeah.
*  So he doesn't even have to, you know, he's kind of in that gravity conversation of
*  the Currys and the Jokic where even if you think he's not really impacting
*  anything, he was 35 feet away from the hoop and that attempt to defend him, which
*  he already could tell what they were going to try to do was like, you guys are
*  absolutely wasting your time because I'm not even going to, the ball's not even
*  going to be here by the time you guys come up and then you're going to be
*  spread out behind.
*  We talked about this in the past.
*  I agree with everything you just said to pick your poison kind of last level of
*  basketball because Yoko just like this too, where the, the defense just kind of
*  has to decide at some point, all right.
*  What are, what are we good with because we're going to be giving up something.
*  And the part of what I don't understand about what Minnesota has been doing in
*  this series is I would just want all the world players to decide the games.
*  I'm fine with Derek Jones and PJ washed in and whoever that's why I want with it.
*  Like when Jayden Hardy was in there for a lot of spots, just let those guys knock
*  yourself out guys, because that's what they're doing on the other end with Edwards.
*  They want all the, all the side guys to decide the game for Minnesota on the
*  Dallas side, Luca and Kyrie, like, you know, if, if you're going to stay home at
*  these other dudes and just let those dudes go one-on-one, which they've done
*  over and over again in crunch time in these three games, it just feels like
*  you have no chance, especially the Luca part.
*  I don't know why go bear came back in this game or so.
*  And we'll have the whole go bear conversation later, but I think the best
*  lineup they had for whatever they're trying to do, the best they looked was
*  when Nasrid was out there and there was a Nasrid, Kyle Anderson, Anthony Edwards,
*  McDaniels, I forget who the fifth was, but, um, that when they were able to move
*  and switch that felt like the closest they were to solve in Dallas.
*  Otherwise, I don't know what you'd do.
*  The problem is, is I was with you.
*  I was going, okay, cool.
*  They're going to try something else because even when Dallas went small and
*  then they brought Gafford back in and then Powell gets minutes like his live,
*  that doesn't come back from the game.
*  And that was a brutal need of the back of his head.
*  So you wonder what's going to happen for him the rest of the way.
*  But Minnesota is still big when they're small.
*  So you're going, all right, maybe they can, maybe they can survive here.
*  But the thing is, Bill, they didn't do anything with it.
*  They didn't do anything with it.
*  It was two Nasrid attacks on Luca, which were fine.
*  Okay.
*  He got him once and then the other one was the foul.
*  And then there was a weird Kyle Anderson late shot clock thing where
*  that was happening a bunch.
*  So when you looked at like Rudy, when he came back in from not being in the
*  beginning, they were actually minus two through all of it.
*  And there's like this big Rudy thing where, you know, there's a lot of people
*  that I respect that are really smart and they'll throw this plus minus stuff
*  that we've seen in front of you.
*  It's like, he's actually had the best differential of any player on the
*  Timberwolves and I'll just go, I don't know, man.
*  I don't know.
*  I go, I'm not really sure that that's necessarily what I see.
*  This isn't a Rudy problem game, by the way.
*  So let me probably just stop myself there because I was excited about that as you
*  were, but Minnesota had 102 points at five 54 left to go in the fourth quarter.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  They basically scored two points to close against the 13 one run.
*  And then the last two points were the Edwards layup.
*  So, and the shots were awful.
*  They were all in the shot clock, like just stilted toilet bowl offense.
*  So there was some, there was some minutes in there where I'm thinking, okay, cool.
*  Like let's see an attack.
*  There should be space.
*  They're going to space the floor.
*  They're going to switch.
*  I mean, they haven't really stopped this Dowling Dallas closing group yet anyway.
*  So let's try something else.
*  And then Kyrie got right into the pain a couple of times.
*  So I think Finch was looking at it going, all right, Lucas getting deeper.
*  Kyrie want to drive.
*  So they brought Rudy back in.
*  Yeah.
*  We need a shot blocker.
*  But the problem is, is they didn't, they didn't get Luca into switches.
*  They didn't bring Anna.
*  Maybe they're worried if McDaniels is setting the switch, then they'll just
*  ignore him and then to stay with aunt.
*  You know, there's a conversation there about like, how much, how much do you set
*  screens for an because you're bringing more traffic his way.
*  But when they went small, they actually didn't do any of the things that I was
*  excited about them potentially doing is the point I'm trying to make.
*  I wonder why Denver couldn't unlock Minnesota the way Dallas has.
*  And I, I wonder if, uh, rim protection.
*  Well, but also the, you know, they, they went through last year, they're playing
*  for eight and a half months, however long it was then this year they got the big
*  bullseye and you know, they talked about how they ran out of gas, their role guys
*  kind of disappeared, but when you watch what Dallas has been able to do in
*  Minnesota and put their big guys in space, I wonder why Denver didn't do that more.
*  I don't really know the answer.
*  I'm sure they're watching this series going, damn.
*  Uh, on the other hand, Luca and Kyrie had 66 tonight and it felt like anytime
*  they needed a big basket, they were getting it somehow like the level of
*  shop making, especially in the fourth quarter was ridiculous where it felt
*  like Minnesota played almost perfect defense and, and Dallas would still hit a
*  shot.
*  Um, there's a fun Luca go bear thing.
*  I was actually looking up over the weekend after game two, cause I was
*  wondering like, it really seems like Luca hates go bear.
*  What's this about?
*  And I was like deep dive in it, going through YouTube and stuff, my theory.
*  And I hope somebody asks Luca this.
*  I think it dates back to the 2020 Olympics.
*  Slovenia lost to France by one point.
*  And, uh, and it was, remember the game, but to him had the block.
*  He blocked somebody at the rim, read the buzzer and France one by one.
*  And in that game, Luca had go bear and a switch for a second and the tomb came
*  over and he got rid of it.
*  And the guy he got rid of it too, went to the basket and got blocked.
*  And I wonder if ever since then, Luca's like, I hate this guy.
*  I'm just good at it.
*  But there's been other stuff like he's punched them a couple of times during
*  games, like little sneaky go bear punches that it seems like it's not a punch, but
*  it is a little elbows.
*  They've gone at it a couple of times, but there really seems to be a hop in his
*  step for Luca going against go bear, which I've enjoyed.
*  I liked the animosity in this series.
*  I think it's been fun.
*  And same thing with Edwards where he at that point in the third quarter was like,
*  fuck this, I'm not going down this way.
*  And just took over the game for like four minutes, but couldn't,
*  couldn't keep it going.
*  No, because they had gotten Dallas into the bonus, like eight and a half minutes,
*  nine minutes to go.
*  And if you look at the free throws in that quarter alone, like the game had
*  slowed down and has this great stretch.
*  He has the donkey has the turnaround.
*  He has the bank and you're like, okay, maybe he's actually going to do this
*  because this is, this is what he's saddled with the hope of like, Hey, if
*  you're going to be one of these guys, like you have to be better than you've
*  been in this series.
*  And I have a ton on ant that's incredibly disappointing.
*  There's all these big moments where you're like, you just have to be better
*  than this.
*  And I don't know that there's necessarily a reason we can apply, you know, when
*  somebody is middle-aged and they end up playing below the standards, we never
*  say, oh, he's middle-aged.
*  So I don't know if it's just youth.
*  It's kind of the way basketball works and sports works, but the Luka part of
*  it, I mean, he kind of gets into it with everybody.
*  It's like that Clippers team with Doc and Chris Paul and Blake and Deandre and
*  Austin Rivers was on the team.
*  They argued, they got into it with everybody.
*  I remember one night we were trying to rank.
*  We were like, okay, how many teams have they had a thing with?
*  And I think Luka is almost the individual version of that Clippers team.
*  It's a good call.
*  He's going to go over great in Boston.
*  I can't wait for a finals with him arguing a 45 calls.
*  He's so great though, man.
*  I, that's the thing.
*  And obviously he's been doing this forever, but to watch him do it on the
*  biggest stage where the pace that he plays at, when he gets the half step on
*  somebody and then just keeps the guy on him, almost like a hockey player.
*  And once he has you on your hip, you kind of don't have an option because he'll
*  just stop suddenly and then you're crashing into him, right?
*  You can't reach around cause they'll call a foul.
*  He's too big to get around and there there's just, and then he's got that
*  little, that little, uh, eight foot floater.
*  He can stop.
*  He can just go to the basket.
*  He can then through the alley.
*  And, uh, once he gets a step watching him just use an abused McDaniels, I
*  thought it was pretty interesting.
*  You just get too much size for him.
*  You know who the, who, uh, the type of player to guard Luka is Rossella?
*  I, I do feel like it's, it's a little Nazrish and I don't know why they
*  haven't gone to that more because I think the Celtics, Tatum and Brown,
*  they're actually in pretty good shape.
*  They're not going to stop Luka, but they have the type of tall athletes that
*  at least you're going to make them work, get to his spots, but I don't know why
*  they didn't try Nazrid on him more because Nazrid was good on Jokic too.
*  McDaniels is too small to me.
*  Well, he's too, he's not stout enough.
*  So I would agree there.
*  And he was always going to get a couple of dumb fouls.
*  He had the reaching that was silly.
*  And then he had another one where it looked like he was just mad, but it
*  didn't, I don't think take away.
*  I don't feel like he was playing defense as if he was in foul trouble.
*  Cause that's the thing with McDaniels.
*  Like we can't fall in love with like how aggressive he is on Booker and the
*  stuff he was doing with Murray.
*  And then, I mean, we can always find fouls with he and Kat, where you're
*  like, what are you doing?
*  But you kind of have to sign up for a lot of that.
*  If you're going to fall in love with like the physicality and the
*  challenging and the reaching and trying to get away at, you know, just, just
*  slowing the other player down.
*  But with Luca, it's entirely different animal.
*  The hockey player analogy is perfect.
*  It's kind of like a tight end who ends up in the end zone with a corner on him.
*  Where it's like, you may think you're defending me, but you're not like, I'm
*  just, I'm too big for you.
*  And the craziest thing is it's not about Luca turning the corner.
*  It's just about him playing with all of this pace where he's watching it live.
*  When I went to that Clippers game, like I knew what to expect because I'd seen
*  it before, but there'll be moments he's in the pain and everything's stopped
*  around him and nobody knows necessarily what to do and it almost feels like it's
*  easier.
*  I remember Nash would actually have an easier time making layups because
*  everybody was freaked out about what he was going to do the ball towards
*  everybody else.
*  So you've got that scoring part of it with Luca and the size and the touch.
*  And then something Legler talked about with me, which I loved.
*  He's so great at the late kickout.
*  Yeah.
*  If you'll think, you'll think, okay, this drive is over.
*  He's putting it up.
*  Okay.
*  Like that lobby had left to right to Gafford through all of those bodies.
*  He had another drive in the first half where he's like up on one leg.
*  The shot is about to happen and he just turns and gets it to the right corner.
*  I think it was a Jones three.
*  Um, you know, we, look, we knew how special it was.
*  I voted in the second MVP.
*  So, you know, it was just by default because I thought it was so close with all
*  of those players that I started just kind of dividing it by like, who do I actually
*  think is the better player of these players?
*  And I only had one guy ahead of him and there's a reason.
*  I don't know.
*  Uh, there's one guy that I can remember in the last five, six years who I felt
*  like actually did a really good job on Luca.
*  This is a deep hole.
*  And somebody mentioned this to me recently.
*  I was like, Oh yeah, it was Ben Simmons.
*  Ben Simmons, Ben Simmons did a good job on him.
*  There's a couple of bad Luca box scores against Ben Simmons teams.
*  And I think that's the type of guy I think it's got to be like six, nine and
*  strong and athletic, which of course there's four or five guys like that in the
*  league, ironically, Tatum is one of them.
*  And I wonder if Tatum is when it's Boston Dallas, if that's going to be part of
*  what Boston does is it's going to be Tatum and Jalen, but basically Tatum fourth
*  quarter, but then you're putting on all these defensive miles on Tatum.
*  You're risking foul trouble with Tatum.
*  You know, it's, it's asking a lot.
*  Yeah, it's asking a lot.
*  Maybe to close, maybe to close the game.
*  And then Jalen probably for the first three quarters.
*  But the great thing about this Jalen season is, is, you know, he's really
*  accepted the defensive challenge.
*  And I think he's been genuinely impactful on defense and he's taken, there's been
*  some of the better players in the league.
*  Like there was that Zion game he had this season where he's just like, okay, I
*  got it, I'm going to take this guy.
*  So they have two really good guys to throw at them, but then you bring the
*  Kyrie piece in it.
*  And that's another pretty solid spot for Boston where they have these two really,
*  really excellent defensive guards that they can at least throw them and make
*  them make some shots.
*  He'll still make them.
*  It doesn't really make, you know, I don't know if anyone's shutting down Kyrie
*  when he's like this, the crazy thing about it, I don't feel like he's played
*  at this level really for like six or seven years, like with the speed, the
*  decision-making, the shot-making combined with what he's doing defensively.
*  Cause the defense is where he really went sideways and really seemed like a
*  liability, especially like that Brooklyn Celtics series.
*  Remember two years ago, as that went on, it just felt like they started hunting
*  him and I, that's one of the things I know he's been putting up points, but I've
*  been really impressed by the all around stuff with him.
*  It's an incredible redemption story.
*  Somebody I gave up on as a basketball star.
*  I'm not saying like that.
*  Go ahead.
*  No, I'm just like other people ran.
*  I'm not saying because I gave up on him that matters, but I'm just like, I just
*  didn't think we would see a two way performance like, like this from him at
*  this stage of his career and kind of giving up on it.
*  It might matter to him to hear you say that.
*  It can be funny Kyrie to press conference.
*  Hey, you know, I heard Bill Simmons.
*  He's reconsidered some of his thoughts.
*  So I said, that means a lot.
*  He had two plays.
*  The shot he hit left-handed going right to left and ant actually gave it a decent
*  contest and it was off his left hand.
*  And my favorite thing about the Kyrie offensive explosion, cause I even think
*  against Oklahoma city, it was being a little overstated cause I felt like he was,
*  he was actually a little too passive in that series for long stretches.
*  Cause I would look at the stuff he was turning down, which we've already covered.
*  But then there was a moment where it was like, okay, wait, you know, they're
*  really gearing up like Minnesota.
*  I felt like had to hit these two, like peak output defensive stretches.
*  One was after the ant dunk.
*  And there was another one there in the fourth quarter where they were trying.
*  I mean, they were trying their hardest and then for Luke could have the luxury
*  just to throw it to Kyrie and he turned the corner.
*  Um, that was made at one 11, one Oh five.
*  And at that point, Minnesota had gone over four minutes without a field goal.
*  So it's, it's absurd that you have somebody like Luca, but you know, this
*  is the whole part about Dallas is like, if we're saying this now, how come
*  we didn't believe a little bit earlier?
*  I didn't realize that Jayden Hardy would come in and give them great minutes.
*  You know, we're talking about what do you give up?
*  And I would agree with you.
*  I'd probably want to shrink the paint and or collapse the paint, whatever
*  you want to say, and leave the corners.
*  And then Oklahoma city saying, yeah, yeah, that's what we tried to do.
*  And then PJ Washington turned into an all star and that Jones had his massive game.
*  So all of this has worked and the lively gaffer part of it.
*  And I mean, Exum, who was actually like a nice little piece for them,
*  it hasn't even been needed.
*  And hard away has been like nothing, even though he's back and healthy.
*  It's, it's just incredible how much.
*  This team has come together.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he played the other night, but you don't even notice him out there.
*  So I don't think he got out there today.
*  Yeah.
*  The, the, the other thing, go ahead.
*  Do you have more on that?
*  Cause I, I think, well, just you mentioned the Derek Jones thing.
*  He was, they, him and Washington were five for seven from three in the first half.
*  Right.
*  These are, these are guys that are in the low thirties, usually as three point
*  shooters and those guys have come through and that's part of playoff basketball.
*  Right.
*  You just certain guys rise to the occasion, the crowd, the spotlight, the energy
*  and, uh, and they targeted those dudes and those guys have shown up.
*  I watched Eric Jones for years.
*  I'm, I don't know how many teams he was on.
*  They've really stood out.
*  It was always like, oh yeah, he's seems like a fairly interesting defensive guy,
*  but wasn't somebody that I thought would be hitting huge shots in a conference finals.
*  No, no.
*  I mean, the thing is because of the Luca part of it and because of having to
*  make sure you're paying attention to what side Kyrie is on, there's
*  just a lot of open shots to, to ask a defense to go, Hey, make sure.
*  Make sure we're switching or make sure we're blitzing.
*  I thought Minnesota did a better job extending the pressure out to them,
*  but Luca just figures it out.
*  And if Kyrie's coming off of that, if two were on the ball and Kyrie's able to
*  get the ball four on three with his speed.
*  So, uh, it's, it's come together, man.
*  It really has.
*  And it's, and it's, I was wrong that I thought, you know, Minnesota and
*  Denver was the NBA finals because I didn't know that Dallas was going
*  to take it to this level.
*  I mean, I know these games are all close and there's other stuff that I want to
*  talk about, but I'm, I'm kind of in awe of what I've seen this team do,
*  especially to close threes.
*  You figure just the law of averages.
*  They have a clunker to close in one of the three against Minnesota's
*  defense and it hasn't happened.
*  Yeah.
*  You figure game one it's, uh, I think Minnesota is up with two minutes left.
*  Game two, they're up five with 90 seconds left and over and over again, Dallas
*  defense just stepped up and then Dallas would make shots and it got to the
*  point where in game three, like I said earlier, you just felt like if that was
*  going to be the situation again, Minnesota was screwed.
*  Um, this is something that has evolved.
*  I feel like Dallas figured themselves as the team during that Clipper series.
*  You know, and now looking back at that, okay, see series, cause I thought
*  okay, see was right there, that whole series.
*  As I said last week, I thought that came down to a couple of
*  rebounds and a couple of shots.
*  But, uh, now I kind of respect the okay.
*  See team even more because they were throwing haymakers and Jaylen Williams
*  wasn't even playing that well and they stayed in that series and it was the six
*  gamer, um, that's true because I mean, think about it, PJ's not foul in the
*  corner, who knows?
*  Okay.
*  See wins game six.
*  Maybe Jaylen Williams, they've got game seven at home and we're going, oh man,
*  Dallas is going to be sneaky, interesting team next year, you know, but instead
*  they're up three Oh on a team.
*  I figured after the Denver series was the best team remaining in the NBA.
*  So we're selling the pregame show.
*  I don't know if you saw it.
*  I didn't, but one of the guys on the set said some guys had to step up.
*  Get out.
*  It was a new, it was a new thing.
*  Can't remember hearing that before.
*  And, uh, I think it was Shaq who said he'd like to see Anthony Edwards and
*  Carl, Anthony Towns step up.
*  I would like to see it.
*  I agree with him.
*  Anthony Edwards kind of stepped up town, stepped backwards and down.
*  He stumbled down.
*  It's what's the opposite of step up a stumble down.
*  It got to the point.
*  I was teasing house at halftime that he was going to be in the wizard's next year.
*  House didn't like it.
*  There was some unprintable text that, uh, returned towns was just awful.
*  Just awful.
*  And who I, for two and a half games just looked like his superpowers had been.
*  The plug had been on pole.
*  Then all of a sudden he found the superpowers again.
*  Uh, but it was a little too little too late.
*  Um, what are you seeing?
*  Well, this series could be summarized with this.
*  I mean, coming out of a game one and two, you had the differentials.
*  Um, aunt and cat were 21 to 69.
*  Luca and Kyrie were 41 to 28.
*  So that's 20 more makes from the four best guys on the Dallas side.
*  You're going to lose.
*  Like when I see that kind of thing, I'm like, I'm shocked.
*  You know, they were in both of those games and threw them away.
*  Uh, today it was six more makes for that side of it.
*  So it actually like somehow improved.
*  Um, let's just do the cap part first because it's easier.
*  He's not that good.
*  He's not that good.
*  Um, we know he can stretch the floor a little bit.
*  This best shooting big man thing is so stupid.
*  He takes four game.
*  Um, his drives against lively or like golfing with somebody who's never golfed
*  before and you're like, where the fuck are you aiming?
*  You're like, oh, right over there.
*  Like the flag you're like, that's the American flag.
*  That's at the clubhouse.
*  The flag is over.
*  It's over there.
*  Uh, he, he actually got a little bit better on the drives today when lively went out,
*  but I went back and looked at every shot attempt he had and believe it or not,
*  there's, I thought it was going to be worse going into it.
*  There's more good shot attempts and bad shot attempts.
*  He was handed a lot of shot clock grenades in the first two games, but the
*  drives themselves are pointless.
*  They're just pointless and you can see what he's doing.
*  He's like, but might as well drive.
*  And then when everybody went small and he was still in, maybe Gaffer was back at
*  that point, he couldn't post Kyrie and it led to a turnover.
*  He lost his positioning against Kyrie.
*  So he is a huge part of the problem, but the biggest problem is that aunt is even
*  close, so I expect that from cat.
*  I don't expect aunt to have this.
*  These, I should say these many bad moments, which we can go to here.
*  Like, what do you think is, when you see aunt right now, like, where are you with it?
*  I'm going to sound like I'm making excuses for him.
*  Like I'm related to him and I don't need to sound that way.
*  I think the playoffs are really hard.
*  I've been on a lot of texts because people know that, uh, I like Edwards and
*  just like, what's happening in your guy.
*  Getting a lot of the playoffs are hard.
*  He's 22 years old.
*  It's the third round of just a whole level of basketball and intensity and energy.
*  And the only reason I mentioned this is because I watched it happen to Tatum
*  two years ago and I'm watching Tatum in these playoffs two years later versus
*  what was happening to him as the third and fourth round of 2022 went on.
*  And it's weird.
*  It like cut the playoffs kind of for young guys, they kind of break your brain.
*  If you're not ready for it, if you haven't been through it, if you don't understand
*  it, the only way I can compare it.
*  And again, I know it sounds like I'm making excuses for Ann.
*  I'm not.
*  The only way I can explain it is, is it's like a boxing match.
*  When you see this guy who's never been like in the old days when we had the 15
*  round fights and it was the guy, it was the first time I was like, Oh man,
*  50 round title fight, man, these extra three rounds are awful.
*  I, I, I can't believe this, this last nine minutes.
*  I never, never knew it was like this.
*  Like you're just not conditioned for yet.
*  And that's what I see with him.
*  I don't like he was so tired and so out of it in game one and then
*  game two, it felt the same way.
*  He just didn't have the same energy.
*  So they did all the stuff they did for him today where they're trying to put him,
*  hide them on, you know, non-scores.
*  They're having other people bring the ball up.
*  It's it seemed like a whole bunch of things to just try to have him
*  have energy in the second half.
*  So it sounds like an excuse, but I just think there's a reason 22 and under guys
*  have not won four straight playoff rounds that it's that unusual.
*  It's basically magic Johnson and magic Johnson was not somebody who had the
*  ball all the time he was on a team with Kareem who's the best player in the world.
*  So, you know, two years from now, is he going to look like, is he going to get to
*  round three and just look like he has no power left in his battery?
*  I don't think so.
*  I agree with a lot of what you said because it's usually the way it goes,
*  which is what made it so exciting with him and the Denver series.
*  You're like, wait, is this really going to happen?
*  Like when I was walking around, getting ready for that game seven, I was like,
*  is he really going to do this?
*  Not granted, he went six to 24, so they didn't win because of him.
*  But to come back against Denver down 20, like, all right, we've recovered.
*  Was incredible in that game though.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But still you got to be better.
*  He hasn't been impacting this series defensively like he impacted that game seven.
*  No, but they're tougher matchups too.
*  So I think the point it isn't really making excuses.
*  I think that was the excitement about him to be like, are we actually going to see
*  a guy fourth year in 22 years old, take this kind of jump and like maybe win a title?
*  Like, what is this?
*  Almost like a rookie quarterback.
*  Like, wow, this guy's just going to rip through the playoffs.
*  Guys, you want to.
*  And I know I'm guilty of like thinking about, but even when I would get excited
*  about it going like, I think he can do it, I'd go, wait, like you've been watching
*  this league a long time, this isn't really what's supposed to happen.
*  And so game one, him being tired, if you're 22, it's just not really much of an excuse.
*  There's days off.
*  I think of the combination of the Kyrie part, but also he played so much point
*  guard in game one, like I was going back and looking at it.
*  I was like, all right, so he's bringing the ball up the entire time because they're
*  worried about Conley's injury and he had left the game today and then came back.
*  He's actually been pretty steady for him.
*  And then he was in game one, guarding, guarding Kyrie for a lot of that game too.
*  Like it was what they asked them to do in game one was, was, uh, right, right.
*  I think stupid.
*  So then you look at the game one drives, because I was looking at every single
*  time he was looking at every one of his, his shot attempts, he had one.
*  Like touch in the paint the entire second half of game one.
*  So you feel a little bit better about game two, because I thought we saw
*  some more aggressiveness, but then the turnover at the end is inexcusable.
*  You can't do it.
*  And I know people are on Finch's case for not calling the time out to get
*  Conley back in the game.
*  And that's a fair criticism.
*  I'm not saying it's wrong, but you also don't expect Ant to throw it out of bounds.
*  The spacing on that play was terrible.
*  Bear has Gafford pinned at the rim.
*  Um, I think Nas and Kyle are to the left side and they're actually like on top of
*  each other in the corner, like they're getting ready to break out of an inbounds
*  play, but then Ant still throws it out of bounds and then tonight the drives were
*  better, but he's been missing layups like crazy.
*  He missed four straight layups that were good looks in game two.
*  He had the missed layup when they were small and he got the ball back and he
*  waited.
*  They had a timeout and it's like, dude, what do you think's going to happen?
*  This is closing time, a game three of the place that you got to get rid of the
*  basketball or dribble out of there.
*  And he lets himself get tied up.
*  And though, even though he won, he completely froze.
*  So those moments are despite his greatness and what he was doing in the
*  third quarter, it's, it's unfortunate.
*  Cause I thought like with his personality, his attitude, and he's just, you know,
*  this is not the guy staring down, Kevin Durant saying you're done and I'm next.
*  This is a guy that looks really uncomfortable in some big spots and it's
*  for it's it's disappointing for how great I think he is, but it doesn't mean
*  any, it also means like, okay, he's actually likely to go through the normal
*  course of events for the great players in the league.
*  Cause a lot of these guys are already on vacation post on an Instagram and he's
*  playing in the Western conference finals, but he hasn't been good.
*  It still sounds like we're making excuses for him.
*  I don't care.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't, I like, look, if he sucks like this for three playoff, like two more
*  playoff seasons, all right, sign me up.
*  I'll say I was wrong, but there's also an incredible joy with this because of the
*  Jordan comps, which no one like no one's sane was actually saying, I think this
*  guy's going to be better than Jordan.
*  It's just that he looked like him.
*  Well, I think what was so fun about the first series and a half was all the
*  history we had with somebody at that age, trying to do what he was trying to do.
*  Said this shouldn't happen.
*  It's impossible.
*  And then he kept making it seem like it was possible, which was what was so
*  freaking exciting about it.
*  And guess what?
*  It's really hard.
*  You're 22 years old, but I'm telling you, we, we watched this with Tatum and, and
*  I Edwards, maybe the ceiling for him as a player might be a whiff higher than
*  Tatum just cause of, uh, you know, as, as good as I think Tatum is the ceiling
*  for Edwards is don't you think like maybe, maybe a smidge higher as a star, but
*  the all Tatum went through all of this in 2022 is my point.
*  Um, I'm not going to let these, by the way, I'm not going to let these four
*  games make me like, go, Oh, maybe this guy's going to be that good.
*  I'm not there yet.
*  All right.
*  But the bigger issue is towns is in his late twenties and they needed him in
*  game two and they needed him tonight and he sucked the whole series.
*  And it's gotten to the point that, um, when he drives to the basket, it looks
*  like he's wearing somebody else's sneakers.
*  It's like, what did towns bring a sneakers?
*  No, he's wearing some kid from the first row is the size 14.
*  He's never worn these sneakers before.
*  It's just, he just looks clumsy.
*  He's missing wide open shots.
*  I don't feel like his shots are going to go in, you know, and you think about how
*  he played those first three quarters of the Denver game seven, where it was like,
*  it felt like there was some sort of breakthrough for him.
*  And now we've gone backwards to the point that, you know, we're probably going to
*  be making up towns trades in a couple of weeks because the, the, the salary cap
*  for them is outrageous, you know, and I don't know if it's sustainable to keep
*  this team together and just be 75 million over the cap.
*  And if you, if you think you can't keep towns, Nazred and go bear going forward
*  for the next few years on a small market team, like you gotta figure out something.
*  But the bigger, the bigger question to me is like, I just think this is who he is.
*  I don't know if there's a level up for him.
*  And this is a reason we've spent so much time talking about him being like,
*  what is this guy?
*  Is he good?
*  Is he not good?
*  Is he the best shooting big guy in the league?
*  Or is he somebody that just, you know, uh, against when he's playing
*  worst teams or lesser opponents, he looks great.
*  But if you keep up in the stakes, he can't, he can't kind of hang on as
*  the stakes keep going up because he was a liability in that they got benching
*  game two and he got benched in game two.
*  Like who are the towns fans?
*  Like who, who's fake?
*  Who's like my favorite player is Carla Carlin at three towns.
*  They need them on that.
*  That, I mean, they ran it a couple of times tonight when he sets the screen for
*  Edwards and it's a little pick and pop.
*  And it's like, in theory, that place should be unstoppable, but for whatever
*  reason, Dallas there's, it's not.
*  And by the way, because they already have Nas and we saw what they were without
*  cat, like there was a fear, okay, maybe there just won't be enough offense.
*  I mean, the irony of this Minnesota thing in the closing moments of these
*  last three games is that it felt like this is a real problem for them during
*  the regular season.
*  We were like, you know, it'll be weird though.
*  What's the clutch offense going to look like?
*  And then if you look at the clutch playoff stats, their offensive numbers
*  were actually pretty good.
*  The shooting numbers were pretty good.
*  They just weren't in a lot of minutes.
*  Um, and I'd imagine those stats can be dragged down again tonight.
*  I mean, they were, they were brutal.
*  I mean, they had like two points from like five 54.
*  And the first two games, yeah, the last three minutes, they just turn over,
*  miss shot, turnover, turnover.
*  It's just, was, was bad.
*  And Dallas has a good defense.
*  What's, what's interesting about Dallas.
*  Luca is one of those guys that in your head, you feel like he's a bad defender,
*  but he's not, and his hands are around.
*  He's tipping stuff.
*  Like, I think he had five steals tonight, you know, and you, you wonder, like at
*  one point Reggie Miller was asking why they didn't attack Luke and it's like, I,
*  I feel like they are trying to attack Luca.
*  I feel like every team in the playoffs has tried to figure out how to attack him,
*  but he's smart.
*  He knows where to go.
*  And, and, uh, basically what he can't do.
*  And very rarely do you see him 35 feet from the basket one-on-one.
*  And if he is, they'll send a second guy out.
*  Like they don't want to expose him.
*  That was one of the things Minnesota just wouldn't do with go bear.
*  But you think game one comes down to Luca makes a three, Nasrid misses the three.
*  Right.
*  Um, I felt like they should have left that they should have left Minnesota.
*  The series should have been tied one-one, but instead Dallas is up to nothing.
*  And then tonight they should have won, but Dallas has been pulling these games
*  out now for four weeks and at some point it's not an accident at some point.
*  Every time you're in a close game, you win.
*  It's not an accident.
*  Now game two was the one that I had the hardest time with because you had the
*  Jaden play where he loses out of bounds, because Kyrie fouls him.
*  And then it's like, Hey, let's review it.
*  That'll fix it.
*  And instead we just waste everybody's time to make sure the call is extra wrong.
*  But you know, aunt can't throw it out of bounds.
*  And you brought up something in the very beginning.
*  We started talking about, like, I'm with you Dallas because it's aunt only.
*  And there's, there's crowds everywhere.
*  I do think when they had that small stretch there, I would have thought like,
*  Hey, bring Luca up.
*  Just see what happens against aunt.
*  But I still think they would have just kept two with aunt and then ignored
*  McDaniels and been like, fine, do you want to shoot a three?
*  Cause we don't know what we're going to get out of you any single night.
*  Conley's going to hit a couple of floaters or a three.
*  That's fine.
*  We don't trust cat Rudy can't catch Rudy's only good with the offense.
*  If it is already decided before the catch that it's going to be a dunk.
*  If there's any moment where it's like, okay, I have the ball.
*  Now I have to figure out what to do.
*  It's a useless possession.
*  Um, Kyle Anderson is somebody that don't even really defend, even though I think
*  there were times in the series that I've liked when Kyle played against Luca.
*  And maybe it should have been a nod McDaniels, Kyle and Nas combo.
*  But now I'm just making up shit.
*  You know, I'm making up shit for a team that was, that just beat
*  Denver by playing their way.
*  Um, but I felt like they were searching for it a little bit.
*  It'd be interesting to see if they search a little bit more for.
*  That's a really important thing.
*  You just said, I think teams, when they get this far in the playoffs and through
*  the season and he gets around three, you become afraid to change who you are and
*  what you were and how you got there.
*  I even think Joe Maz was like this with Brissette where it was clear that
*  Brissette needed to play in the San Diego series, but Joe Maz for eight months,
*  the team is basically, you know, 73 and 20 playing a certain lineup, certain way.
*  And it's like, I don't want to play Brissette.
*  I like playing my guys like.
*  How's there's lost his confidence now.
*  Right?
*  What do you do with that going forward?
*  You can't just be like, here are my guys.
*  This is what's worked for us.
*  Like you have to adapt and move as the series has gone along.
*  And I think Minnesota was a little afraid to move away from Rudy and as, and
*  towns is, don't you think towns is one of those, oh, he doesn't have it guys.
*  I never felt, I feel like, you know, with towns in the first quarter and a half,
*  I don't know if it's coming back.
*  No proof.
*  Just I test.
*  Um, and by the way, my small, my small lineup, like, like experiment theory,
*  Luca would probably be like, awesome.
*  Cool.
*  I'm just overpowering right now.
*  Now it's so easy.
*  So like, I, I think your point though, whether it's it's interpreted stubbornness,
*  I think the coaches are always worried about losing somebody that's been
*  important to what they've been doing.
*  But Minnesota bench towns all through the end of game two, right?
*  Well, they're already lost.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're not losing them at that point, Hey, I'm Luca.
*  I went through this because the NBA teams came out and I'm going to fight and
*  fight and fight for them to put positions back last year, next year.
*  Cause I thought that I thought the awards were ridiculous this year, the four
*  centers on the first team, all defense, one of the dumbest things we've ever done.
*  Like, let's try to at least make this look a little like basketball.
*  So when I talk about all NBA, I'm comparing this year's voting to the
*  history of the league anyway.
*  Luca has made first team five straight years.
*  And I was like, Hmm.
*  And I went through it and I was trying to figure out best streaks for first
*  team, OMBA, which for some reason could not be Googled stat muse.
*  Get on this shit.
*  I was, I was really banking on you.
*  I do this myself.
*  Um, Carl Malone and LeBron James made 11 straight first team, OMBs.
*  Did you know this?
*  I knew LeBron did.
*  I didn't know Carl Malone did.
*  11 straight first team OMBA is like, that's, that's more than a decade.
*  That's you have a seven year old kid.
*  The first year of the streak.
*  Cause graduated from college by the end of that, uh, Bob Cousy and Bob Pettit made
*  10.
*  Well, I must've got a lot of AP credits.
*  Oscar, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, all nine in a row.
*  Duncan and Kobe eight in a row.
*  Shaq, Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor, seven in a row.
*  Yana Sinhardt in six in a row.
*  And then, uh, Luca, Katie Dwight and George Mike in five in a row.
*  All of those guys are like the greatest players in the history of the week.
*  And Lucas 24.
*  And we were texting over the weekend about like, Hmm, what does this mean if
*  Luca just wins the finals where, you know, where, where does he stack?
*  But like, when you think of the OMBA resume, the fact that he already got to a
*  conference finals with a team that really, when you look back, it's kind of crazy
*  that, uh, they beat Phoenix at a game seven loss ended up losing the gold state
*  in five, um, just this career he's having and putting together and he's still on
*  the under 25 version of his 20s.
*  And he's got the kind of game that I just feel like it's not, it wasn't going to
*  lose athleticism.
*  I mean, the only thing you would worry about is, is he going to get bigger than
*  he is?
*  Well, it doesn't even seem like his size seems like weirdly an asset.
*  You know, it's, it's, he's, it's almost a little like Yoke Hitch where he's, he's
*  big enough that it's more of a problem than a hindrance for, for him.
*  And I think it's a problem for the other teams.
*  So, you know, I think, especially if we're going to have two sweeps and we're not
*  going to have the finals until a week from Thursday, this is just going to be a
*  nine day long Luca conversation.
*  I think over the Celtics, I think, I think Luca, where does he fit?
*  Is he the best player in the league?
*  Can he be one of the best players of all time?
*  Like all of these questions are going to start getting asked now.
*  You're right.
*  It's going to happen.
*  And it's already started to happen.
*  And this is why I want to talk about the belt transfer.
*  But before we do any of that, what I do like about this developing storyline with
*  Ant and Luca is the Luca part of this.
*  There's like all the things you wanted Ant to be.
*  Like I, I did all these things already.
*  Like I didn't get to the Western Conference finals at 22, but I mean, he
*  turned 25 in February, so he was only what a year off from that.
*  So he was six months, maybe older, I think than Ant being in the Western
*  Conference finals this year.
*  So with the speed with which we move and kind of re-ranking all these guys, which
*  is, I think like I can become stubborn or I can seem stubborn or I don't want to.
*  Cause I think the mistakes are made is when you're constantly changing everything
*  like on the latest outcomes.
*  But, you know, when you look at Luca, the first year he's leading scorer as a
*  rookie, they go 33 and 49.
*  The second year they have that great series against the Clippers.
*  You're like, dude, this guy's going to be better.
*  Right.
*  31, 10 and nine.
*  And then the third year he loses in seven to the Clippers and his
*  numbers are 36, eight and 10.
*  Like those series were so much fun.
*  And then the fourth year he's in the league Western Conference finals, they
*  lose the Golden State, they didn't really have much of a chance.
*  You look at his supporting cast or those teams, there's not much there.
*  I mean, he's carrying that team, but they beat that awesome regular season
*  Phoenix team the year after they had lost the bucks, the finals, which again,
*  we've been over that game seven, plenty of times in the pod.
*  Then last year's the year of things kind of fall apart.
*  So I love the parallels of Luca getting through the West and maybe winning a title
*  and being like, you guys were so ready to crown aunt, which again, I'm raising my
*  hand saying I'm fully guilty of.
*  But like, I just did all the things you were hoping aunt could do.
*  Yeah.
*  And like there was never, there's never been a game like ants had three games
*  now in a row in this series where I'm like, what the hell's going on?
*  And you know, you can find a bad game in there with anybody, but Luca, Luca's
*  not going to have three games in a row in the playoffs.
*  You're like, what's wrong with them?
*  Yeah.
*  Luca can still go seven for 20 in a playoff game and still seem like he's the
*  best player and still be impactful in all these different ways.
*  And I'll still grab 11 rebounds and get nine and says, do you see that stat
*  they showed with the alley oops?
*  And this was like, I think in the second quarter where Dallas had 45
*  alley oops in the playoffs and the next highest team had nine.
*  They probably ended with 50.
*  They said the most since what?
*  20 2001.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was trying to write it down and I was like TNT, you have to like for the
*  note takers, you're going to be slower with these graphics because when I saw it,
*  I went, wait, what?
*  Like 45 and then the next, it's like some Wilton number and then here was second
*  place and his lobs, you know, I said, tray was probably the best, but.
*  Lucas size allows him to just stop.
*  I would say it's you, Yoko and Luca and the finals for the labs.
*  I think tray's up there, man.
*  Cause he does a really great job.
*  The Brooklyn nets tray.
*  Yeah.
*  Trey's awesome with lops.
*  So he's, he's a tier one lobber.
*  How about that?
*  Barclays on tray young.
