# Who Will Be the Next Knicks Coach? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ)
*  Nick's coach drama boy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Boy, there's been some buzzing boy. There's been some tidbits and some [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Some things being talked about okay sources are saying stuff. Well, what are they saying? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=7.54s)]
*  I don't know just seems that Nick's team was a lot more dysfunctional than I think [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=12.84s)]
*  third hand centered [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=17.36s)]
*  Rumors and but man feels a little games a game of thrones II over there [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=19.64s)]
*  Dysfunctional well, okay [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=24.52s)]
*  So are you talking about players or like when you say a game of Thrones you usually mean? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=25.5s)]
*  You know the upper echelon of management question for you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  so Jaylen Brunson's dad is one of the coaches of the team and worked with tips for a long time and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  Danta de vincenzo was yelling at him for some reason in that first home game and seemed like he had felt betrayed by him [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=38.16s)]
*  And there's always rumors that he had an outsized [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=44.0s)]
*  voice with Leon and all those dudes [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=46.64s)]
*  If you're the next coach [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Do you want your own staff or do you want to inherit this staff that? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=51.72s)]
*  Felt like it got a little game of thrones II down the stretch there. Okay, so [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=55.72s)]
*  Every coach wants his own staff and there are some coaches [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  There are some coaches for whom that's been a deal-breaker when they are told during the hiring process [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=64.2s)]
*  Well, you got to keep this guy or you got to keep this guy. You got Kate these two guys [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=68.72s)]
*  It's either it's it's been either a deal-breaker or be grudgingly [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=71.56s)]
*  Accepted by a coach who really wants a particular job with an eye on like, alright, I'll give it a year and then I'll exercise my power [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=75.52s)]
*  This is obviously a much different situation since he is the father of the franchise player and I think [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=82.32s)]
*  that is a discussion that has to include lots of different parties to come to a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=88.36s)]
*  If a change is made, I think a lot of different people have to be involved in that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  I don't when you talk to people around the league [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  there's a lot of skepticism that there would be a change made because [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=99.88s)]
*  He is Jill and Brunson's father. But I think skepticism is underrating it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=104.32s)]
*  I think people think he will be on the bench. Yeah, that's kind of what I meant. Yeah [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=109.0s)]
*  But you know dysfunctional is like it's a strong it's a strong word [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  80 it's just like every team's got its stuff, right? Every team's got its stuff in the locker room, but a lot of leaks [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=121.16s)]
*  lot of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  Maneuvering the story from the moment the season ended all the way through that athletic thing that we talked about on our podcast that came [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=130.64s)]
*  Almost right afterwards the scapegoating and that was really interesting. I've been fine [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  That was cat cat was kind of hit hard and that one and tips right called it out [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=144.12s)]
*  That night when I read the story was like, alright, this is notable that these are the two scapegoats. Let's see how it goes [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=149.88s)]
*  I'll be interested to see if [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  Cat will be the other domino that falls with this but would who wants this job is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  I assumed Johnny Bryant was gonna get it [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  Because the Sun said there were two people left him the guy who got the job [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=166.7s)]
*  Jordan odd give Jordan. I don't love who apparently is married is somebody named Jordan. Did you hear this? I [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=172.34s)]
*  Did not I have not both named Jordan interesting couple. That's that's what I heard. I don't know if that's true. Wow [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=178.54s)]
*  But uh, so Johnny by guys how many names how many names could you do that with? Okay, you know, not many have the same [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=185.26s)]
*  Yeah ready. We have to be like Jordan Kelly [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=191.56s)]
*  Yeah, Kelly's a good one [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=194.5s)]
*  Anyway, Alex. Yeah, Alex is a good one [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=196.7s)]
*  But uh, so when Johnny was in the final two and then all of a sudden the other guy got it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=200.14s)]
*  I just assumed he was the the next thing. I don't think being gunned II that name got flown around but he's which one [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=204.22s)]
*  Jeff he's friends with uh, yeah, I just obviously really close with tips. I don't see him being like cool [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=211.74s)]
*  Yeah, you shanked my guy. I'd love to take the job everything he's ever said [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=216.98s)]
*  Publicly and privately would cut against him taking that job [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  So who's left the only name that didn't really get mentioned that I was surprised. Oh [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=226.10000000000002s)]
*  You're excited [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  Taylor Jenkins is a good coach. I watched a lot of Memphis games going man. They have a really good coach [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=233.34s)]
*  And he's just kind of sitting there [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=239.18s)]
*  Everyone was talking Mike Malone, but to me that that just feels like you're running back a different version of tips [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=241.22000000000003s)]
*  Taylor Jenkins I thought you can make a pretty fair case with him that he [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  Had a really tough job the last couple years. He's a very good coach. Taylor Jenkins is a very good coach [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  Memphis to New York as a market and as [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=259.3s)]
*  Expectations faced is about as big of a jump as you can make and you go from Chris Vernon to 40 Chris Vernon's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=262.5s)]
*  I mean, does James Dolan know who Taylor Jenkins is? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=269.7s)]
*  Like start there like I'm not even being facetious like is he aware that that's a coach I don't know [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure he's hiring the next coach. I think this is a Leon thing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=279.86s)]
*  But he's got a sign off on it [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=284.42s)]
*  Who do you think's gonna be the next coach? I have no earthly idea. I mean, I you know, I've heard rumblings of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=287.86s)]
*  Like they maybe they want an ex-player [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=295.7s)]
*  An ex-mba player, I don't know if that's I don't know if that's true [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=298.90000000000003s)]
*  My favorite is Ron our tester and his hat in the ring was my number one thing that happened [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=302.82000000000005s)]
*  He really wants to coach. He really wants to coach. I'm pretty sure he's not gonna get it. I don't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=306.66s)]
*  I see come up on like the the list of like, you know [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=313.22s)]
*  They've the 20 best odds to coach the New York Knicks where it's like the bottom one is the last one is like Stephen A [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=316.18s)]
*  Smith like they get real Joe House is right above him [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  I I thought the name I thought Frank Vogel might come up just because he's a New York guy [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=324.42s)]
*  But he's you know, he's been in a lot of places now in a short amount of time. Look the one [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=329.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, well he's I saw that you you [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=338.66s)]
*  Boosted his uh, I'm gonna get more involved [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=342.74s)]
*  Watch out [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  I'm gonna get more involved that wasn't involved enough and I'm gonna get more involved like it wasn't his idea to throw cam johnson and then [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  Kevin Durant trade and like one more pick and just be like whatever takes [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=354.82s)]
*  You got him on your podcast right off the bat and now you're like, yeah [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=358.58s)]

*  Because he's clearly halfway there. Vivek was locked it down in the 2010s [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=377.94s)]
*  That is coming in for a late a late 2020 rally. You can't count him out [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=382.98s)]
*  You can't [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=388.42s)]
*  He just can't he's I'm not saying his pee hasn't locked up yet, but he's he's in the lead and he's feeling good [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=390.82s)]
*  But Vivek, you know who knows but Vivek won last decade and then I think probably dolin won [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=397.06s)]
*  in the 2000s [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=402.98s)]
*  With all the crazy shit he did he's too he's he's not hilarious though. It says it doesn't fit him [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=404.58s)]
*  Doesn't who would you have in the 2000s? Sarver? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  No, nothing. They're they're malicious people. They're not hilarious. Sarver like did illegal stuff [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  Um, like well, we didn't know that in the 2000s though civil litigation anyway. No, that was later. I'm saying 2000s [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=420.9s)]
*  When he basically hired steve kerns like you have to get under the luxury tracks trade all our picks [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=427.86s)]
*  I mean [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=432.74s)]
*  He he wasn't you know, it is it was cuban [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=434.74s)]
*  From a hilarious standpoint some of the stuff where he was sitting on the bench and remember the time he ran on the court [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=438.66s)]
*  During the fight to break up the court and then realized he shouldn't be on the court. He had some funny stuff [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=443.94s)]
*  Ishby is the clear winner in the 2020 stuff. I mean, I guess we can't blame [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=448.98s)]
*  Well, we can blame but it wasn't hilarious [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=454.66s)]
*  Glenn taylor for just overseeing the entire david khan experience in minnesota [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=457.46s)]
*  But you know, this is why you're the best not only that but the he lost four picks for joe smith [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=462.74s)]

*  I find it hard to believe johnny bryant's going to be the head coach the more I looked at it and thought about it [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=526.3399999999999s)]
*  It just doesn't seem like he's experienced enough. This is one of the biggest jobs in the league [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=531.3s)]
*  I would bet on taylor jenkins frank vogel mike malone one of those guys who [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=536.3399999999999s)]
*  At least has been in some situations. What about the what about the um, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  Can we trade for your coach gambit that has been mentioned with ime odoca and jason kid? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=545.14s)]
*  Any of that interesting to you? Why would houston trade ime odoca like just throw him out. He's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  They're not getting rid of him. That's ridiculous. I agree and I don't think he would leave [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=557.06s)]
*  It's a great situation even with the east being so much worse in the west [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=560.5s)]
*  It's a great situation and also like I know [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=563.6999999999999s)]
*  How houston's gm rafael stone negotiates would just be like you don't even have enough you don't have enough [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=567.38s)]
*  I want three first round picks and you don't even have that [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=572.18s)]
*  The kid one is interesting to me [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=575.38s)]
*  Yeah, because he's I wouldn't think I didn't love the luca one. I wouldn't take my eyes off it [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=578.1s)]
*  That's all I that's all I would say now. I wouldn't I wouldn't take I wouldn't disqualify it [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=583.2199999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't take my eyes off it in part because as you and I are batting it around we can't find another candidate that's like oh that's [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=587.2199999999999s)]
*  That makes a ton of sense for a team that has said in its press release announcing the firing of tom thibodeaux [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=593.6999999999999s)]
*  We are a championship roster. At least we believe we are that's the pressure. That's the expectations [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=599.3s)]
*  That's why it's hard to imagine a first-time head coach walking into that job [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=605.3s)]
*  I apologize to the friend who sent me this. Oh boy that I can't remember their name [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=611.22s)]
*  What kind of friends are you [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=617.6999999999999s)]
*  but [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=619.6999999999999s)]
*  Made the point tibs would have been the greatest atlanta hawks coach [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=621.46s)]
*  And that the best outcome would have been a quince niner for tibs trade [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=625.62s)]
*  Over firing tibs because if you put tibs on atlanta, he basically just could have run the nicks offense with [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=629.7800000000001s)]
*  Trey as jaylen brunson [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=635.94s)]
*  But then had all this defense and all these wings and a kangaroo as the shop walker [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=637.0600000000001s)]
*  And just done the tibs with that team and trey could have shot [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=642.02s)]
*  36 times again. I really apologize to my friend who texted this but I thought it was great [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=645.0600000000001s)]
*  And then quince niner on the nicks bench [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=650.02s)]
*  With the red glasses just just being weird and handsome [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=652.5s)]
*  He's got to get blue glasses then blue glasses or orange glasses dark blue glasses [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=656.02s)]
*  I thought that was a really good one [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=659.86s)]
*  I think I think it's a guy with some pedigree the malone would be a weird one though because he's a little gruff like uh tibs was but [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=661.46s)]
*  The guy won a title two years ago [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=669.22s)]
*  Well, so that's a great this is a point I wanted to make and I should have made it about tibs [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=672.18s)]
*  And i'm gonna make it again on my podcast this weekend. Michael mullen's a great name to bring up [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=675.86s)]
*  Mike buddentolzer is a great name to bring up not for this job [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=680.9s)]
*  But for this for this purpose frank vogel is a great name to bring up not necessarily for this job, but for this purpose [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=684.02s)]
*  The idea that tibs is not a championship coach that you need a different coach to take your team [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=691.54s)]
*  He's the floor razor who can only take your team so far. I think there's some merit [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=695.86s)]
*  to the general idea of tibs is that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=701.54s)]
*  Because he is [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=704.74s)]
*  Indisputably an incredible floor razor incredible and I don't think he's like a carlyle spoh level [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=706.0s)]
*  quarter for quarter minute for minute [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=713.46s)]
*  Adjustment guy that's your playoff dream coach, right? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=716.4s)]
*  But I don't think any of those other guys were either [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=719.7s)]
*  And like that's why mike buddentolzer got fired in milwaukee. It was too slow to adjust blah blah blah [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=723.38s)]
*  Michael malone was never thought of as like this incredible [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=728.42s)]
*  Wizard of adjustments and all this stuff and those guys won championships like if you have the right talent and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=732.02s)]
*  um [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=739.38s)]
*  If you have the right talent right year right circumstances like yeah [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=740.26s)]
*  Tip I should have been clear about this like tom tibetot can absolutely win an mba championship [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=743.62s)]
*  Even if he is more of a floor razor than a ceiling razor [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=748.1s)]
*  He can he's so good at getting your floor so high [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=751.46s)]
*  That he can get you into that spot [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=755.5400000000001s)]
*  He can absolutely win a championship and like that's why that michael malone mike buddentolzer remember budd was like on thin ice [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=757.3s)]
*  Several times in milwaukee mostly because of the idea that he was not as good of a playoff coach as someone like eric spolstra [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=764.8199999999999s)]
*  Who kind of exposed him a couple times and he won the championship? That's all [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=770.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it seems like it was time for tibs to go in new york after five years [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=775.54s)]
*  Didn't you split it felt like it felt like the the the core guys [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=780.26s)]
*  were good [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=785.4599999999999s)]
*  Moving on with him and you lose the core guys. It's it's a wrap in the mba [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=786.9s)]
*  And that's why the longest tenured coaches in the league go back to 2020 [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=790.74s)]
*  Can we just the core guys? I I know cats had experience with tibs before maybe so maybe this doesn't matter [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=794.5s)]
*  That was rocky from the get-go. I'm sure it was like no no, it's fine. Now. How do we know? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=800.5s)]
*  And anobi like kind of just got there, you know [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=804.66s)]
*  It's not like he's been there all five years with tibs [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=807.9399999999999s)]
*  It's not like towns has been there all five years with tibs or heart has been there all five [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=810.66s)]
*  He's been there a lot mcbridges just got there. It's not like they've all been there for like [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=814.1s)]
*  Four years of just like oh my god another shoot around with tibs. Like, you know, it's it's not like they've been there that long [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=818.5799999999999s)]
*  Seemed a little uh [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=825.54s)]
*  Seemed a little gamey. That's why I flagged it for you in april when you jerk backwards [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=827.62s)]
*  And I still like they made the conference finals they did and the thing is a lot of it has to come down to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=833.06s)]
*  how do you view those first two games against boston because [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=840.1s)]
*  They were they were before tatum torus achilles. They were about to go up three one probably win that series [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=843.9399999999999s)]
*  And you would think like wow [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=850.26s)]
*  What a feather in their cap that they're going to knock the defending champions out pretty honestly until that injury [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=852.26s)]
*  Unless you think the first two games were about boston just were like 75 choke [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=858.42s)]
*  25 comeback and not 50 50 [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=864.08s)]
*  Can I give you 90 10? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=867.38s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. I was trying to be nice to the nicks [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=869.46s)]
*  I was on a tech start about this two days ago because I was looking at the third and fourth quarter box scores from game one [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=872.26s)]
*  And getting mad all over again [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=879.86s)]
*  The celtics took I think it was 34 shots in the second half and 27 of them were threes [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=883.14s)]
*  They took 20 20 shots in the third quarter with a 20 point lead at various points [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=890.26s)]
*  And 19 of them were threes [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=895.78s)]
*  They took zero free throws and the whole thing is like after watching what indiana did to the nicks [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=896.98s)]
*  To think that the celtics just walked the ball up and just jacked up threes and that was their offense [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=903.22s)]
*  And what a giant favor they did for the nicks in both of those games [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=908.66s)]
*  And then the nicks hung around they grabbed the game much like indiana today, but to me that was a boston [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=911.7s)]
*  just an absolute strategy collapse where you're just like [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=917.62s)]
*  It was basically the opposite of okc tonight where okc is like actually we're going to change our lineup [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=921.3000000000001s)]
*  We think maybe this would be a little better for us boston was like we do this [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=925.54s)]
*  This is all we do [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=929.62s)]
*  We don't care who we're playing [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=931.38s)]
*  This is our formula. We're never going to deviate from it [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=932.98s)]
*  And then you see how easy it was to just push the ball in the nicks [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=935.62s)]
*  Get towns or brunson in any sort of switch keep running run after [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=939.6999999999999s)]
*  Run after made baskets just keep pushing the pace on them [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=943.78s)]
*  And they didn't do any of it and they had the same kind of players indiana has better versions than them in some cases [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8mgT_NOKQ&t=947.06s)]
