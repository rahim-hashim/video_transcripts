# Curry Survives, Trae Melts Down, Ant vs LA & WWE President Nick Khan | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU)
*  Alright taping this a little after 10 o'clock. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's watch Gold State hold off Memphis in the playing game. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=28.38s)]
*  It was a fascinating one. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=30.7s)]
*  Kurt Goldsberry. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=31.9s)]
*  I love the playing game. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=32.9s)]
*  Eight, nine is great. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=33.9s)]
*  Super fun. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=34.9s)]
*  We got a blowout. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=35.9s)]
*  We got a fun game. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=36.9s)]
*  We get some trade young trade rumors coming out of the first game and then the second [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=37.9s)]
*  game. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=42.7s)]
*  Memphis, a team that I was not a huge fan of who I think is now 12 and 18 in their last [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=43.7s)]
*  30, put up a spirited fight. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=48.7s)]
*  There's a couple moments of this game where I was wondering if Golden State was actually [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=51.7s)]
*  going to blow this and be in this bizarre scenario of losing to San Antonio, losing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=55.06s)]
*  it over time in the last day of the season, then blowing this Memphis game at home and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=60.940000000000005s)]
*  now all of a sudden fighting for their lives just to play OKC who just won 68 games, but [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=65.26s)]
*  instead they escaped. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=70.9s)]
*  Now they play Houston. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=71.98s)]
*  What was your big takeaway watching this game? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=74.06s)]
*  Oh, it shouldn't have been that close. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=76.9s)]
*  It was a frustrating game for both teams, honestly. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=79.18s)]
*  And Steph Curry. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=82.62s)]
*  I mean, two giant threes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=84.38s)]
*  I think he's bookended his season before the season, that masterpiece in Paris, and now [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=86.94s)]
*  to wrap up the regular season and secure the playoff spot for his team, two just classic [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  Curry threes when they needed them most. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=99.06s)]
*  It was an incredible moment, but a real frustrating end too. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Draymond fouling out there, Jimmy Butler throwing the ball away. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=105.66s)]
*  This team, they should have put them away earlier, in my opinion, but they got there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=110.14s)]
*  They got it done. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=115.02s)]
*  Now they have this fascinating season series coming up with with the Houston Rockets, Bill. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=116.02s)]
*  It's one of those weird subplots of this entire Warriors run dating back to 2013. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=120.64s)]
*  Abject sloppiness at the worst possible moments in crunch time, and they somehow won four [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=128.94s)]
*  titles and go down as the most, you know, one of the most memorable teams of this century. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=133.52s)]
*  And yet at the end of games, they're up three and I'm watching and just expecting something [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=138.72s)]
*  stupid is going to happen. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=142.96s)]
*  Curry's going to dribble the ball off his foot. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Somebody's going to lob a pass across court that's going to get picked. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=146.24s)]
*  A dumb foul. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=149.4s)]
*  Like it's for a team that fancies itself on high IQ stuff and they do have, you know, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=150.4s)]
*  an unbelievable basketball IQ. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=155.96s)]
*  They sure do dumb sloppy things at the worst possible times. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=157.52s)]
*  It's really, really, really odd. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=160.68s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=164.0s)]
*  Among the league leaders and turnovers and they've been loose with the ball this whole [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=165.64s)]
*  era. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=170.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good way to put it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=171.96s)]
*  Loose with the ball. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=172.96s)]
*  Little loose. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=173.96s)]
*  Little loose with the ball. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=174.96s)]
*  But yeah, the Draymond foul was like, dude, the time is on your side at that point in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=176.76s)]
*  the night and they just give them the free throws. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=181.88s)]
*  The refs didn't help either. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=185.6s)]
*  I'm not going to say it helped either team. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they were just bad. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=188.96s)]
*  The Phantom foul on Eady and Pods had a great block I thought was clean. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=189.96s)]
*  But this is the result I think we all thought was going to happen tonight. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=195.56s)]
*  I think the Warriors securing the seventh seed. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=199.08s)]
*  And a little Houston matchup. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=203.08s)]
*  Well, let me, big picture on Golden State, a team that I was really bullish on. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=205.08s)]
*  And this will be, this is now prison of the moment, Bill. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=210.84s)]
*  This is my time of year. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=214.0s)]
*  This is when I really shine overreacting over and over again and try not to overreact. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=215.08s)]
*  I think Golden State's lineup stuff is a little alarming for a team that I thought really [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=219.56s)]
*  had a chance to win two, three straight rounds. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=225.92s)]
*  Kaminga is now just out. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=228.2s)]
*  Not only is he out, but you look at the box score today. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=232.0s)]
*  Curry led the team in rebounds. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=236.16s)]
*  That doesn't seem ideal. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=238.44s)]
*  They got killed on the boards. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=239.44s)]
*  Eady's size, I thought, what did Eady finish with? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  17 rebounds. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  Eady's size really bothered them in this game. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  And it still feels like a team that's kind of grasping for stuff. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=249.44s)]
*  And if Jimmy wasn't awesome in that first half, I think this game could have slipped [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  away from them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=258.88s)]
*  But the big question for me, I was on Zach's pod on Monday. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=259.88s)]
*  I didn't even realize that Kaminga got benched in that last game. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=262.4s)]
*  I thought he was hurt because why wouldn't they play him? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=265.32s)]
*  They need somebody like him. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=267.44s)]
*  This game was just a Kaminga game. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=269.32s)]
*  This was an athletic physical. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=272.3s)]
*  They needed his rebounding. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=274.02s)]
*  They needed size. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=275.4s)]
*  And they still buried him. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=277.3s)]
*  So I guess he's just out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=278.3s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=280.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's remarkable. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  I know I was listening to you and Zach too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  It's great to have Zach in the network. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  But it was noticeable tonight. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=287.7s)]
*  I mean, Golden State's old. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=290.54s)]
*  You have Draymond, who's old, who had just sort of banged up his neck the other day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  Old guy injury. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=297.7s)]
*  When you have like neck injuries, it's an old guy thing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=298.7s)]
*  Steph has a bandage on his hand, his shooting hand. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=302.14s)]
*  And Jimmy, obviously, was limping around after that Clipper game. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=305.98s)]
*  This is an old team. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  So it's another reason why I expected to see Kaminga again tonight. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  Just because of the depth. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  He's a young player. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  He's another body. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=317.1s)]
*  But again, Bill, like you said, no Jonathan Kaminga. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=318.1s)]
*  Early in the game, the bench actually saved them early. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=322.88s)]
*  Memphis came out hot and Post and Gary Payton both, I thought, sort of gave them a fresh [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=326.06s)]
*  burst of energy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=332.3s)]
*  What does Kaminga have to do to get some run out there? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=334.94s)]
*  Yeah, I guess you could say Butler played 39 minutes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=337.14s)]
*  And maybe they just don't want to play Butler with with Curry and Kaminga. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think the lineups were the plus minus stuff with those three together were pretty [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=346.14s)]
*  bad for most of the season. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=350.38s)]
*  And maybe they just made a decision if we're going to play Draymond, he played 30 today, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=352.42s)]
*  but he's a foul trouble on Butler 38. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=356.66s)]
*  That's just not a lot of room left for Kaminga. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=360.42s)]
*  But then you look at the rest of it like Heald played 12, Payton played 19, Looney played [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=362.84s)]
*  nine, Post played 21. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  It was pretty good. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  I just for this specific game, if I'm Memphis, I'm like, hey, that's great. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=371.28s)]
*  Please don't play Kaminga because he's somebody that could carry some offense. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=375.76s)]
*  I mean, when you have 75 points for two guys and, you know, Payton is your third leading [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=379.23999999999995s)]
*  scorer who just had wide open shots the entire game. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=386.88s)]
*  Not great. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=391.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, on the one hand, first round is great for Golden State because of the breaks [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=393.24s)]
*  between the games. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=397.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=398.04s)]
*  It's the same thing for the Lakers. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=399.04s)]
*  The older teams first round is where you want to be, where you might play Saturday, Tuesday, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=400.04s)]
*  Friday, Sunday. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=404.44s)]
*  You just have all that stuff. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=405.44s)]
*  But on the other hand, it just feels like some of the teams in the West are still going [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=407.44s)]
*  up and whereas the Warriors have kind of leveled off and now are completely dependent on having [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  big games from Stefan or Jimmy. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=417.8s)]
*  They're going to this Houston series where they're going to be able to throw just a shitload [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  of dudes at Curry. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=425.6s)]
*  And we already saw it with Ahmed Thompson two Sundays ago and try to wear him down. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=426.6s)]
*  They also have a bunch of wings to throw at Butler, which brings back the Kaminga thing. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=431.8s)]
*  But it feels like Kaminga is now in the attic with the Christmas ornaments and we're just [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=437.04s)]
*  not going to see him again. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=442.88s)]
*  And I think he's going to be an interesting figure to watch in another way too, because [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=443.88s)]
*  Houston is one of the better rebounding teams in the league too. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=448.88s)]
*  And when Draymond's you're big and you're not getting a lot of rebounds with Post out [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  there and you just start to wonder, are they going to have to put Kaminga in just to match [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=457.68s)]
*  the athleticism and the physicality of this Houston team? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, because why wouldn't Houston be able to do the same thing that Memphis just did [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=467.08000000000004s)]
*  with Edie and Jackson when they put their double big lineup? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=470.68s)]
*  I would think that would be a nightmare for the Warriors. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=473.32000000000005s)]
*  The other thing that's interesting with that matchup, I believe, is, you know, Dylan Brooks [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=476.18s)]
*  and Fred Van Fleet, nobody stops Steph Curry, but those two guys have both done a great [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  job defending Stefan. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=486.02s)]
*  Relatively speaking for the last five to seven years, Van Fleet in the 2019 finals and Dylan [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=488.5s)]
*  Brooks for years on this Grizzlies group. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=496.26s)]
*  Not to mention, as you said, Ahmed Thompson, I think Stefan had one of the worst games [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=499.86s)]
*  I've ever seen him have on April 6th. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=503.85999999999996s)]
*  One of 10, three total points. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=507.61999999999995s)]
*  The only three points he got, Bill, were on a 34 foot three bomb. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=509.78s)]
*  He never got anything going. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=514.5799999999999s)]
*  Eme Adoka was essentially calling my crybaby to his face. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=517.3s)]
*  It was just a nightmare game. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=522.16s)]
*  And so I'm really fascinated by this matchup on a lot of fronts. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=524.9s)]
*  And the question for me is, can this aging set of great players, Hall of Famers, match [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=528.4200000000001s)]
*  the energy and the physicality of Eme Adoka's fleet of young bloods who are just dying for [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=534.4200000000001s)]
*  this moment? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=540.74s)]
*  Well, and this is Houston Golden State, just a classic old school NBA playoff matchup, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=541.74s)]
*  the young guys against the older guys. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=547.6600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=549.5400000000001s)]
*  It's like Golden State's washed up, but they're older and their guys have a lot of playoff [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=550.5400000000001s)]
*  years, a lot of playoff memories. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=555.1s)]
*  But it's, you know, this is the 87 Celtics against the Pistons. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=556.66s)]
*  This is the 91 Bulls against the 91 Pistons. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=560.98s)]
*  Like we've just, we've seen this over and over again over the years, the OO Lakers against [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=564.6999999999999s)]
*  the OO Blazers. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=569.3399999999999s)]
*  And in this case, you know, I thought Houston would be favored in the series because they're [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  the two seed. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=580.3399999999999s)]
*  They have home court in game seven. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=581.3399999999999s)]
*  They just kicked their butt a couple of 10 days ago. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=584.02s)]
*  What do you think the odds are on FanDuel because they came out? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=586.6999999999999s)]
*  And now you've dabbled on the gambling side a little bit. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=589.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=592.3s)]
*  I would say- [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=593.3s)]
*  You've been corrupted by Amy Howe a tiny bit to look at the odds. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=594.3s)]
*  I think FanDuel is going to have the Warriors' slight favorites. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=598.06s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=603.18s)]
*  Well, you're right that they're favorites. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=604.18s)]
*  It's not slight. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=607.66s)]
*  They're minus 200. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=608.66s)]
*  Dang. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=609.66s)]
*  I think that's too much, Bill Simmons. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=610.66s)]
*  I think that's going to move. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=612.3s)]
*  And we did, Rossella and I did the live Clippers Nuggets line on Sunday and it was way higher [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=615.62s)]
*  than now. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=621.54s)]
*  It's like, I think the Clippers are favored now, but before the Nuggets were like minus [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=622.54s)]
*  160, that Rockets line is going to drop because all the dudes that they can throw at Curry, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=625.6999999999999s)]
*  home court, youth, the fact that Curry's banged up, the fact that Jimmy hasn't played like [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=633.14s)]
*  this kind of level of basketball over and over again in a couple years where you're [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=640.98s)]
*  just like, hey, Jimmy, we need you now for 39, 40 minutes a night. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=644.38s)]
*  And the lack of like that third scorer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=649.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't know who I'm picking yet. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=654.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to wait till Thursday. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=655.86s)]
*  I really want to analyze it, but to me, this series is an absolute toss up. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=656.86s)]
*  And I think the double big lineup and all the people that could throw at Curry are [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=661.2600000000001s)]
*  real advantages for Houston. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=664.1s)]
*  I assumed it was going to be this matchup all day and I'm with you. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=667.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't know who I'm going to pick. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=670.18s)]
*  I'm tempted to pick Houston because I'm sick of everybody just telling me Golden State's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=673.8599999999999s)]
*  going to walk away with a series like it's going to be easy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=677.2199999999999s)]
*  And I know that's not going to happen. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=679.54s)]
*  I know that's not going to happen. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=681.18s)]
*  And I don't think those odds are correct. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=684.5s)]
*  But yeah, I also could see a world where Golden State goes down there, steals game one or [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=686.62s)]
*  game two and is feeling really good about their chances back in the Bay. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=691.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=697.18s)]
*  I just think those odds are a little wrongly priced. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=698.18s)]
*  I think that Emea doka is going to have these guys ready to do what they do best, which [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=701.02s)]
*  is incredible defense, incredible defense, physicality and rebounding. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=709.3s)]
*  Some punishing post up stuff. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=717.26s)]
*  Maybe somebody starts making a couple threes from the corner that you wouldn't totally [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=722.56s)]
*  expect. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=725.6999999999999s)]
*  The ceiling of their team is pretty high. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=726.7s)]
*  I just don't know if they can hit it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=728.94s)]
*  They held Golden State built to 90 points and one of their where they play five times [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=731.3000000000001s)]
*  this year because the end season tournament and one of those games Golden State only scored [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=736.1s)]
*  90 points. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=741.1s)]
*  That's a pretty remarkable stat. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=743.98s)]
*  I think Golden State needs to score 100 to win. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=745.38s)]
*  I think they're like one in 10 when they don't score 100 or something like that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=749.5400000000001s)]
*  If Houston's defense is able to clamp down on this Golden State offense, the Rockets [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=754.02s)]
*  have a good chance to win the series. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=759.38s)]
*  It feels like we've had a lot of Warriors Rockets over the years. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=762.6s)]
*  It also feels like Steven Adams has played the Warriors in a few playoff series over [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=766.6999999999999s)]
*  the years. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=770.74s)]
*  Dillon Brooks said that. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=771.74s)]
*  There's weird history between these two teams and some of the players, which makes no sense [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=772.74s)]
*  because Houston's such a young playoff team. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=776.26s)]
*  If I was a Houston fan, I would look at tonight's game and be like, that's our blueprint. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=779.2199999999999s)]
*  Big size on the boards. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=785.26s)]
*  Try to play up and down and as chaotic as possible. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=788.2199999999999s)]
*  Try to get them into where they were. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=791.16s)]
*  Is it going to slop in offense? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=792.8199999999999s)]
*  Use your athleticism. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=795.18s)]
*  Try to wear these dudes down and hope at least one or two of your guys can get a little heat [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=796.2199999999999s)]
*  You know, because if you catch the Rockets on the wrong day, when it just looks like [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=803.46s)]
*  a rock fight for them for the last seven minutes, you're like, what's going on with this team? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=809.3000000000001s)]
*  They're in a little bit of the same position as Golden State. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=813.46s)]
*  They're not positive who their best five is to close the game. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=818.22s)]
*  It kind of depends on the situation. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=821.62s)]
*  That always makes me nervous when I get to the playoffs. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  I kind of like to know who's my five, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=825.5400000000001s)]
*  The best thing about the Celtics and some of the best teams is the Cavs. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=829.06s)]
*  OK, see, they kind of know who their five is. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=833.4599999999999s)]
*  But the other best thing that Golden State has going for them. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=835.54s)]
*  How much would the league want a Golden State Lakers series in round two? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=840.8199999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be Minnesota or Houston from a, hey, like I'm just going into those [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=847.66s)]
*  series and be like, guys, we're probably not getting a ton of calls over the next two weeks. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=852.9799999999999s)]
*  So just how are we going to handle this? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=857.5799999999999s)]
*  Are we going to be cool with this? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=859.38s)]
*  Because that's probably how it's going. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=860.38s)]
*  It crossed my mind many times today. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=862.42s)]
*  The great thing about that, too, for the league is like it guarantees that either LeBron or [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=865.6999999999999s)]
*  Steph is in the Western Conference finals, too. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=870.26s)]
*  So if they get to round two, you know either one of those glamour franchises and superstars [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=873.54s)]
*  is going to be in the Western Conference finals. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=879.9799999999999s)]
*  So yeah, that crossed my mind, too. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=882.06s)]
*  Well, how about if the Lakers beat Minnesota and it's Houston, Golden State on the other [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=885.5s)]
*  side? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=891.02s)]
*  That's also a complete no-lose for the NBA because Houston Lakers would be an awesome [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=892.02s)]
*  series that has the same kind of bad blood all over the place, including Ime, who got [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=896.4200000000001s)]
*  kicked out of a game for calling LeBron a bitch, which was amazing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=901.34s)]
*  Brooks who has tried to make his decades mission to be LeBron's rival to very little success. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=906.7s)]
*  And then Steven Adams, who's always willing to bang into somebody. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=914.54s)]
*  But that's just such a weird matchup. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=917.98s)]
*  The Rockets going double big and the Lakers don't have bigs. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=921.3s)]
*  The Lakers don't have real bigs. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=926.98s)]
*  Rui, LeBron have sort of masqueraded. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=929.02s)]
*  They have bulks. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=932.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=933.34s)]
*  Bigs in this Western Conference playoffs are a big piece of the puzzle. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=935.82s)]
*  I think the Hartenstein acquisition changes Oklahoma City's ability to play big this time [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=939.78s)]
*  around. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=946.74s)]
*  Obviously, Joker is in there. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=947.74s)]
*  But I think the Western Conference, there's three incredible series and let's probably [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=951.06s)]
*  expect that 1-8 series to not be that great. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=956.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think that might be an NBA TV exclusive. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=959.86s)]
*  Do they still have the NBA TV series? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=963.42s)]
*  They do, right? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=966.78s)]
*  OKC versus whoever. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=968.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=969.98s)]
*  That might be squandered. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=970.98s)]
*  OKC Dallas, I think you just shoved that over on NBA TV. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=972.3399999999999s)]
*  OKC Memphis. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=976.42s)]
*  Or maybe it's to be. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=977.42s)]
*  OKC Memphis, by the way, should be Vancouver, Seattle. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=979.42s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=983.22s)]
*  That would have been pretty crazy. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=984.22s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=985.22s)]
*  That would happen. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=986.22s)]
*  OKC Memphis would be a fun series because the thing about Memphis, I don't think they [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=987.22s)]
*  have any title aspirations whatsoever, but they are fun to watch. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=990.66s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=994.22s)]
*  I think we're in games. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=995.6600000000001s)]
*  The other team is always going to have two guys in the 30s. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=996.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I hope our man John Morant is back and ready to go on Friday. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=999.6600000000001s)]
*  I think he turned his ankle pretty bad. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1004.6600000000001s)]
*  Or the U-8 theory might have to convene. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1007.6600000000001s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1009.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, they did seem to play well. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1010.6600000000001s)]
*  Bane had a great game. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1012.6600000000001s)]
*  Bane almost helped. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1014.1800000000001s)]
*  He almost stole this game. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1015.1800000000001s)]
*  He was making it seem like every shot. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1017.78s)]
*  And the ones he missed were like these torturous misses that would go in and out. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1019.6600000000001s)]
*  He looked great. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1024.02s)]
*  But yeah, Memphis played pretty well, I thought. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1025.02s)]
*  And I think OKC isn't going to have a problem there. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1027.82s)]
*  But if John Morant gets to play OKC, I think that would be really entertaining, actually. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1032.46s)]
*  I can't say it was the greatest Jaren Jackson performance. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1038.74s)]
*  And I really agonized. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1043.62s)]
*  I ended up leaving him off third team OMBA, making way for a couple other guys. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1045.46s)]
*  I just saw too many of those where it's like he's good, he's solid. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1050.82s)]
*  But you're also forgetting he's out there for large chunks of time. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1055.58s)]
*  He's impactful, but not totally. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1061.4199999999998s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1063.7s)]
*  That was a game where I feel, especially with Golden State as small as they were going, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1064.7s)]
*  I felt like he could have kind of dominated that game. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1068.78s)]
*  And I think the situation is what it is. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1071.54s)]
*  He settles for threes too much. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1075.4199999999998s)]
*  I think he's going to be able to play well over half of his shots again today against [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1078.14s)]
*  that smaller team or behind the three-point line. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1082.8600000000001s)]
*  When he was sort of running that offense last year in the absences of Bain and Morant, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1085.5s)]
*  he was doing a lot more driving and a lot more playmaking. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1092.98s)]
*  That didn't exist tonight. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1095.7800000000002s)]
*  It didn't exist tonight. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1097.7800000000002s)]
*  And I'd like to see him be a little more aggressive against some of these matchups, because he's [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1099.5s)]
*  so talented. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1103.0200000000002s)]
*  But yeah, I still think they're going to win against the winner of, I'll pick them to win [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1104.02s)]
*  against the winner of the Sacramento Dallas matchup. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1110.22s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that one? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1114.1399999999999s)]
*  I think it needs a sponsor. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1116.02s)]
*  Is there a dysfunctional product that could be the sponsor? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1117.98s)]
*  Dallas and Sacramento, two of our most dysfunctional franchises. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1121.98s)]
*  Whatever that product is. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1127.1399999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's probably some sort of pharmaceutical product. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1129.78s)]
*  Or maybe it's like a CBD thing, because you have to kind of get a little buzz on as you [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1134.22s)]
*  watch the dysfunction. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1140.5s)]
*  But yeah, I have no idea. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1141.5s)]
*  You could tell me Dallas is just ready for the season end, I would believe it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1144.1s)]
*  Sacramento is always a roller coaster ride, and both of them had really, really, really [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1147.8999999999999s)]
*  abnormally strange seasons. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1154.1399999999999s)]
*  Like the Sacramento, the firing Mike Brown, going to Christie, just giving up on Fox a [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1156.98s)]
*  year early for reasons that remain unclear, bringing back the Levine to Rosen combo. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1164.02s)]
*  It feels like two teams that I think are going to look a little bit different next season, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1172.02s)]
*  whatever happens. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1175.82s)]
*  Yeah, I have no idea what to make of either team. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1176.82s)]
*  I think I'm pretty sure that Sacramento's got enough to win this game. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1179.46s)]
*  It would seem like it, right? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1184.02s)]
*  I said on Zach's pod, I wonder if it's a one, two, three Cancun situation for Dallas. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1186.98s)]
*  Like we just got booed for two months. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1191.26s)]
*  Like, let's get ready to call it a vacation. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1192.82s)]
*  But I don't trust Sacramento either. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1195.22s)]
*  Are we still lighting the beam in Sacramento or do we decide of going five hundred for [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1197.34s)]
*  six months? Maybe it's not beam worthy anymore. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1202.6999999999998s)]
*  Oh, they're lighting that thing. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1206.3799999999999s)]
*  And I expect them. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1207.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they'll light it up, I think tomorrow night. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1208.4199999999998s)]
*  I think they'll light that thing up and then hop on a flight. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1211.3s)]
*  Let's let's take a break. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1215.22s)]

*  The ringer's Iron Man. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1353.38s)]
*  Just had a child, but loves the NBA playoffs [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1355.3s)]
*  and so wired from Cole Anthony Knight that he had to join us. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1358.22s)]
*  But was that a better Orlando win or a more fun Atlanta loss for you? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1364.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was all good. I was just feeding the kid and I was just like, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1368.78s)]
*  you know, I might as well just stay up and hop in this Zoom record. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1371.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm wired. I got to be honest with you. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1373.06s)]
*  I don't know that I'm happier about winning the game [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1375.8600000000001s)]
*  or that I just don't have to watch Tray Young play basketball against my team anymore. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1379.02s)]
*  Like that was it was disgusting. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1381.9s)]
*  Like it was. And maybe maybe I'm super sensitive to it [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1384.66s)]
*  because they played the Hawks a couple of times here down the stretch. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1387.3s)]
*  But it's like he's yelling at the ref for calls that he's getting [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1391.8999999999999s)]
*  during the game. And it's it just feels like, I guess, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1397.3799999999999s)]
*  as a guy who just likes to watch, enjoys basketball, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1400.58s)]
*  because there's a lot of people being like, what's his future this summer? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1402.78s)]
*  Like, you know, he would he would undoubtedly make the magic better. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1404.86s)]
*  And I just can't I could never talk myself into it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1407.94s)]
*  So I'm happy about the win, but I'm mostly just happy [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1410.82s)]
*  that I don't have to watch that anymore. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1413.1399999999999s)]
*  Wow. Skullsbury, if I heard that correctly, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1414.9s)]
*  that was Saruti saying that win was a double win [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1418.42s)]
*  because Tray Young was so annoying in that game. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1421.46s)]
*  Orlando might not trade for him this summer. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1424.14s)]
*  So we won twice. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1426.3400000000001s)]
*  That's how I interpreted that. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1428.14s)]
*  Dude, I've never seen a player taunt a ref like with the ball. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1429.94s)]
*  He was like going to pass it to him and he spun it back to himself [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1433.66s)]
*  like a big brother to a little brother. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1437.0600000000002s)]
*  And that's when he got tossed. That was great. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1438.74s)]
*  It's a tough one. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1441.7s)]
*  Well, it's one of those things that will go into the offseason now, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1442.7s)]
*  and it'll be a narrative. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1445.5s)]
*  And I think he was going to be in trade rumors anyway, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1446.78s)]
*  for a bunch of different reasons. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1449.3400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, that I remember Paul Pierce at this point [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1450.8600000000001s)]
*  with the Celtics when the mid 2000s things weren't going great. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1454.74s)]
*  Many had that thing with the Indiana where he he showed up [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1457.6200000000001s)]
*  for the press conference with this headbandage. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1461.22s)]
*  And it was like, oh, man, is he trying to get traded? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1463.26s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1465.6200000000001s)]
*  They ended up keeping him. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1467.1000000000001s)]
*  But we've seen different players hit this specific point. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1468.3s)]
*  And it does feel like fork in the road now for Trey. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1472.78s)]
*  He was 2018 draft. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1475.14s)]
*  It's a seven years. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1477.1000000000001s)]
*  You know. I I don't know what you get for him. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1479.74s)]
*  You start is like is Jah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1483.98s)]
*  Is it like a Jah type of level for a trade? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1487.5800000000002s)]
*  Is it a level below? Is LaMelo too high? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1490.6200000000001s)]
*  Is it do you try to do your version of that? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1494.06s)]
*  The Jean-Tay Murray, like some picks and an asset. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1496.5800000000002s)]
*  Just get out of it. What would you do, Kirk? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1500.1000000000001s)]
*  Jalen Suggs, what do you think, Sorority? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1502.6599999999999s)]
*  Jalen Suggs. Oh, God, no way. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1504.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm not I'm not going to go like Dallas Mavericks fan level on that. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1506.86s)]
*  But I would stop watching the team if they traded Jalen Suggs for Trey Young. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1510.82s)]
*  I mean, no way. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1513.98s)]
*  I mean, that is Dallas Mavericks level just for the record. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1516.6599999999999s)]
*  It's you can't trade a guy who and I know you're just [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1520.3s)]
*  where this is, it's like a hypothetical, but like a guy who's like kind of the heart [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1523.82s)]
*  and soul of like the energy of the team for a guy who I just don't know what trade is. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1526.26s)]
*  Like, you know, obviously, had the conference final a couple of years ago, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1530.86s)]
*  and I think he's really talented. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1533.9799999999998s)]
*  He led the league in assists this year, obviously. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1535.2199999999998s)]
*  Maybe there's a situation that works for him, but I can't. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1537.1s)]
*  It's just like a basketball fan be like, yeah, I can't night in night out for that. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1539.74s)]
*  I just can't. It's it's it was it was uncomfortable to watch. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1543.34s)]
*  I mean, he's that's why it was so great because the Anthony Black [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1547.3s)]
*  a couple of times who had a great game, by the way, Anthony Black, Cole Anthony [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1549.6999999999998s)]
*  and Wendell Carter carried Paulo in France. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1553.5s)]
*  I mean, more of France a little bit. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1556.74s)]
*  I mean, Paulo was good early and then, you know, got the cut above his eye. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1557.9399999999998s)]
*  So who knows? But those guys were awesome. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1560.74s)]
*  But it was great to see like the action of of [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1562.58s)]
*  Anthony Black kind of got trade tossed from the game. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1565.7s)]
*  And I don't know, man, like I'd rather root for dudes that just like kind of [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1568.94s)]
*  who just I hate to be the old man, but play the game the right way. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1574.42s)]
*  But like, that's just I I don't want to watch. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1577.26s)]
*  I don't want to watch foul baiting. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1580.34s)]
*  I don't want to watch. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1581.46s)]
*  I don't want to watch somebody yelling at the ref the entire game. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1582.06s)]
*  And, you know, that I guess that the magic would [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1584.26s)]
*  would they need another lead guard, they need somebody. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1586.94s)]
*  They need to get the ball out of Paulo and France hands all the time. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1589.38s)]
*  They leave those guys on islands to like at the end of shot clocks [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1591.7800000000002s)]
*  and they just do them a disservice. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1594.74s)]
*  I mean, a coaching thing, though, I don't know. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1595.7800000000002s)]
*  I don't even know if that's a roster thing. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1597.74s)]
*  Like, it would be nice if the offensive ball, even a tiny bit. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1599.5400000000002s)]
*  I'd love Cole Anthony to is, you know, basically carrying them at parts of the game. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1602.94s)]
*  Like, why does he come in with two minutes left in the third quarter [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1606.8200000000002s)]
*  if you go up this massive run and now the Hawks are back in the game? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1609.3000000000002s)]
*  Questions I have after the game. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1611.94s)]
*  But, you know, he ended up doing it anyway. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1613.22s)]
*  But yeah, like I just I just I can't I can't do it with Trey. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1615.3000000000002s)]
*  Kirk. All right, you're in the front office. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1619.7s)]
*  Everybody gets together and you have the tray on conversation [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1624.0600000000002s)]
*  and the problem with the tray on conversation, the stats are there. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1628.22s)]
*  And the conference finals thing is the thing that screws it up [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1632.9s)]
*  because you can't say good stats, bad team guy, because he made the conference [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1635.7s)]
*  finals and you probably have to go back and really look through, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1640.0200000000002s)]
*  well, how did they make the conference finals? What happened? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1643.42s)]
*  And then you have to really analyze that goofy sixer series, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1646.38s)]
*  which was, you know, the end of Ben Simmons's career. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1650.18s)]
*  It was a shortened season. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1652.5s)]
*  And how do you how do you judge? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1654.38s)]
*  Was this just a fluke or are we not giving him enough credit [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1658.22s)]
*  because he was one of the four teams left in a playoffs? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1662.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the answer is. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1666.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think he deserves a lot of credit for that run. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1667.7s)]
*  I mean, what we saw him do in the next series and like getting [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1670.66s)]
*  becoming that villain and becoming a guy who's capable of winning those big games. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1674.62s)]
*  There was a little bit tonight where I thought he was going to get it going [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1679.3799999999999s)]
*  in the third quarter, Saruti, where they opened it up [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1681.98s)]
*  and finally got your team running up and down the court. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1684.94s)]
*  And he was at the forefront of that. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1687.5s)]
*  And then, yeah, like it's not ethical hoops. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1689.82s)]
*  Like he the when the bonus like comes on, he totally changes [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1692.26s)]
*  into the worst, most annoying player with all due respect to Chris Ball [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1696.4199999999998s)]
*  somehow is taking it to another level. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1700.94s)]
*  When the bonus like comes on, Trey Young shines even brighter. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1702.7800000000002s)]
*  But there is some value there. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1707.66s)]
*  There is a team that would take a chance on him. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1709.9s)]
*  Maybe it's somebody like Portland or Sacramento. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1712.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1715.18s)]
*  I don't like the player. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1716.8200000000002s)]
*  I think what the Hawks have that makes it really interesting [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1718.02s)]
*  is they have this incredible defense waiting to be there with these wings, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1721.42s)]
*  with Risha Shay, Jalen Johnson, obviously Dyson Daniels, a Kong Wu. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1725.1000000000001s)]
*  They have this like fleet of young athletes that are ready to shine. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1730.9s)]
*  I don't feel like Trey fits into that. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1734.38s)]
*  So I'm among the other. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1736.98s)]
*  I just I believe that he will be mentioned in a lot of trades this summer. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1738.42s)]
*  Yeah, and I just wonder who the team is. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1743.6200000000001s)]
*  So, Saruti, Anthony Black and a contract. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1746.8600000000001s)]
*  No, just then just you're hanging up. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1750.9s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not even taking that phone call there. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1754.7800000000002s)]
*  Before the Luca thing wasn't there were some talk about maybe [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1756.74s)]
*  the Lakers sniff it around late kind of LeBron thing. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1759.42s)]
*  I never, I never believed that. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1761.98s)]
*  I mean, Sacramento can never be ruled out. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1765.0600000000002s)]
*  With their last 12 years track record, you can't rule them out. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1768.42s)]
*  And the San Antonio would be the wild card for me. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1771.78s)]
*  I know that for people who aren't watching this on video, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1775.66s)]
*  Kurt just made a face and leaned backwards and discussed. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1779.5s)]
*  But I think that's the problem, dude. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1782.98s)]
*  Like when you talk about it with Saruti's team, it's like there's this [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1784.8600000000001s)]
*  visceral reaction. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1787.78s)]
*  When you talk about it with my team, there's this visceral reaction. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1788.82s)]
*  Yeah, I was just thinking, but it might get to a point where if you feel like [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1791.5s)]
*  you can get them for 50 cents on the dollar, like, you know, his contracts, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1795.22s)]
*  not that much longer. I don't know. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1799.58s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't that isn't that kind of what happened, though, a couple of years ago [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1801.98s)]
*  where like it was Russell Westbrook and it was like, well, you know, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1805.26s)]
*  would like a bad team just take a flyer on him just to kind of be interesting. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1809.5s)]
*  But there aren't that many teams. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1813.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is, Sacramento is probably the one, but there aren't that many teams [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1814.34s)]
*  that are just like, hey, we're so bad that we just need to be interesting. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1816.98s)]
*  So let's just take a flyer on Trey Young. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1819.7s)]
*  It feels like you talked about a bill like there's just a lot of talent in the league. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1821.14s)]
*  A lot of these teams are, you know, headed in the right direction, even like, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1824.34s)]
*  you know, the Wizards and the Hornets, like, why would they why would they do that? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1826.8600000000001s)]
*  There are there isn't just that team. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1831.1s)]
*  It's like, hey, let's just do this because we have nothing else going on. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1832.42s)]
*  And there really hasn't been teams like that for a few years now, it feels like. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1835.26s)]
*  Yeah. Plus with the apron. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1839.02s)]
*  Everything's harder, like moving contracts, you know, everything. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1841.38s)]
*  Suri, did you want to make the case for Orlando in round one against the Celtics? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1844.98s)]
*  I was texting our good with our good buddy, Kevin Clark. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1849.42s)]
*  And the thing I said was [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1852.02s)]
*  they I don't think they have any shot in the series, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1854.18s)]
*  but I weirdly think that they could win two games. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1856.06s)]
*  Like, I feel pretty good about that. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1858.38s)]
*  And that's I think it could be a six game series and it'll be tough for the Celtics. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1859.82s)]
*  But I just don't think I don't know how the magic score with them. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1863.3s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how they go to play defense. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1866.34s)]
*  Yeah. Your bet. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1869.54s)]
*  Your best chance is almost on the road in Boston, where the Celtics just seem to fall asleep. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1870.22s)]
*  Every home game for whatever reason, they'll probably steal a game one or two. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1875.02s)]
*  And then, you know, who knows, like people might start losing their minds [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1878.38s)]
*  and say some irresponsible stuff. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1881.22s)]
*  But they, you know, I can't imagine everyone's locked into the magic all year long. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1882.54s)]
*  But the offensive laws that they go through, it's like uncomfortable to watch at times. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1888.02s)]
*  You're just like, how is this? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1891.82s)]
*  I think Zach mentioned to I forget it was you or whoever, but it's just like, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1893.06s)]
*  can we just get some sort of offensive coach in there to figure some things out? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1896.74s)]
*  Why does why does everyone that comes to Orlando, a KCP, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1899.78s)]
*  was a one of seven, I think, from three. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1902.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, Paul and Franz were 0 for seven or eight combined. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1903.9399999999998s)]
*  It's just like, why is it? Why is everybody to go there just immediately? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1907.02s)]
*  And it's not even like some of them are open shots or just missing open shots. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1909.98s)]
*  And I, you know, as much as I like to think like, I think they were there [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1914.1s)]
*  two and one against the Celtics this year. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1917.98s)]
*  I think they a couple of those Tatum wasn't around. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1919.22s)]
*  Listen, it's a couple of years of Orlando having good games against Celtics. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1921.26s)]
*  Like my dad, of course, who's always skies falling in his text [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1925.26s)]
*  sometimes as we get to our playoff time, he was he really wanted to land in a way [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1928.74s)]
*  because he's like. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1932.26s)]
*  Orlando makes me nervous, like, sorry, like they we've had trouble [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1934.02s)]
*  against them over and over now. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1937.5s)]
*  This is with Suggs. Suggs was always a big piece of that is the difference. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1939.1000000000001s)]
*  Atlanta is a great like, you know, when Alabama plays [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1942.6200000000001s)]
*  like an FCS team in the first week, that's a perfect first round opponent. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1946.18s)]
*  Like you just you get you get warmed up a little bit. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1949.74s)]
*  You don't really get beat up. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1952.26s)]
*  Like the problem with the magic is you're going to get beat up for five games or so, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1953.22s)]
*  five or six games, and it might kind of hurt you later on in the playoffs. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1956.9s)]
*  That's certainly a team that like isn't going to be awesome, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1959.7s)]
*  like bruise wise in round two and round three. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1962.14s)]
*  But I just can't I can't see the magic without Suggs scoring situation. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1965.1000000000001s)]
*  I can't see it happening. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1969.82s)]
*  Plus, it seems like the Seltzer happy Kirk Celtics sweep plus one twenty six on Fandel. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1971.22s)]
*  Four to one is plus one sixty eight and Surroudi's two game prediction. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1977.78s)]
*  That would net you plus six, ten Celtics four to two. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1982.14s)]
*  Wow. That's that's a pretty good price. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1985.66s)]
*  A lot can happen in these games. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1988.42s)]
*  People forget how few sweeps there are sometimes. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1990.14s)]
*  I think that the case for the magic winning one is like what they did to the Hawks [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1992.5800000000002s)]
*  three point shooters tonight. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1997.14s)]
*  They had four made threes, Bill. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=1999.18s)]
*  That's like only out of twelve hundred NBA games we watched all year long. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2001.5s)]
*  Only I think 13 times that a team, either team make [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2005.54s)]
*  four or fewer threes. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2011.5s)]
*  So Orlando has been the best three point defense [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2012.8600000000001s)]
*  in the NBA all year. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2016.8600000000001s)]
*  They've suppressed attempts and makes at a very high level. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2019.18s)]
*  That said, I think, you know, the Hawks are not the Celtics. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2024.9s)]
*  The Celtics and Missoula have a way of going from good to great against every defense. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2029.0600000000002s)]
*  And it's terrifying. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2035.14s)]
*  But the case is they will sort of force Boston into, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2036.22s)]
*  you know, and you watched them all year. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2041.3000000000002s)]
*  If Boston has a below average three point shooting night, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2043.54s)]
*  if they hit 26 percent of their threes, they're beatable. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2046.82s)]
*  And I think if Orlando can get some better scoring, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2050.86s)]
*  if they have Cole Anthony playing like this or Wendell Carter Jr. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2054.02s)]
*  playing like he played tonight, they can steal one game. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2057.94s)]
*  I think this is a five game series. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2061.14s)]
*  But I wouldn't surprise if it were four or six. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2063.9s)]
*  I would say it's a five game series in my head. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2066.34s)]
*  It's also like an interesting big brother, little brother dynamic [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2069.14s)]
*  with the Jason Tatum, Paulo thing. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2072.26s)]
*  Both guys, they're friendly. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2074.0200000000004s)]
*  I think Paulo was asked about it after the game. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2076.1400000000003s)]
*  And, you know, he said like the ultimate, you know, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2078.0200000000004s)]
*  compliment or whatever, be just playing well against him. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2079.6200000000003s)]
*  You know, it's a guy who I think a lot of magic fans like hope [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2081.9s)]
*  Paulo that his career steers towards the Jason Tatum. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2084.94s)]
*  Like, he's never going to be that defensively, but at least just kind of like the, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2088.34s)]
*  you know, the caliber of player, the MVP, first team on NBA is like that thing. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2091.3s)]
*  It's an interesting storyline to watch. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2096.0200000000004s)]
*  I just I just watched Paulo too many times. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2097.1400000000003s)]
*  I just go, God, like I understand the criticism about the the [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2099.14s)]
*  like the shooting and the shot selection at times, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2103.46s)]
*  but they just leave him hanging out the dry. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2105.2999999999997s)]
*  So he's asked to do so freaking much all the time. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2106.9s)]
*  And like that's why when Cole comes in and gives him like a secondary ball [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2110.2999999999997s)]
*  handler creator like Cole is pretty inconsistent. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2114.14s)]
*  He was awesome tonight. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2117.2999999999997s)]
*  They just had a guy that can I don't know who that is necessarily. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2118.18s)]
*  I wanted to be Malik Monk in the offseason. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2120.86s)]
*  Who can just like ease the load? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2123.14s)]
*  We're going to keep asking me, ask me. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2125.74s)]
*  I don't know who knows. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2127.9s)]
*  Let's see how the series goes and how depressing it is. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2128.54s)]
*  If you think Kaminga, he's available. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2130.1s)]
*  Yeah, I that's it. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2132.2200000000003s)]
*  It's just a dynamic to watch those two guys going at it. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2135.38s)]
*  Who what's your Tatum plan for this series? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2139.06s)]
*  I would just throw, I mean, Isaac and just hopefully you could just bother [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2143.1800000000003s)]
*  the heck out of them. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2146.7400000000002s)]
*  Isaac's been he hasn't been as consistent this year as he was. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2148.34s)]
*  Although he played a lot of games, so I guess he stayed healthy as a credit to him. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2150.82s)]
*  But I would do that. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2153.38s)]
*  Maybe a little bit of Franz. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2155.58s)]
*  I mean, they're certainly big. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2158.02s)]
*  They've got the size to to you saw tonight. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2159.3s)]
*  I mean, the Hawks are a different team, obviously than Celtics. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2162.3s)]
*  But man, like they just it's hard to get good shots against them. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2164.94s)]
*  Kirk said it. They're the best defensive three point shooting. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2167.66s)]
*  They're the worst three point shooting team on offense, but they also defend [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2169.82s)]
*  and don't let teams make threes. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2172.34s)]
*  So they're they're kind of old school in that way. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2175.1s)]
*  So that's that's the path is just can they just get the Celtics [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2177.2599999999998s)]
*  to not shoot well and play good three point defense and hopefully they can get [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2180.58s)]
*  some shot variance on offense? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2183.02s)]
*  Four for twenty one from three. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2184.78s)]
*  Iconic. It's a box score right out of the early 2010s. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2186.6600000000003s)]
*  All right. So Rudy, I guess we're natural rivals for for the next two weeks. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2192.5400000000004s)]
*  I look forward to it. All right. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2196.7400000000002s)]
*  Thanks for popping on later. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2198.1000000000004s)]
*  Kirk, you did a shooting column on the ringer dot com. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2201.26s)]
*  Yeah, a great website. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2205.5400000000004s)]
*  And you gave out the shooting excellence awards, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2207.86s)]
*  including the Wardell Award for best shooter of the year, Steph Curry. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2210.86s)]
*  Which is the number one award and the and the, you know, the most important. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2215.1800000000003s)]
*  That's like your best picture, basically. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2219.78s)]
*  Is anyone ever going to win this award other than Steph Curry? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2222.42s)]
*  How did you frame this in your mind mentally? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2225.3s)]
*  Could somebody win it when he's still playing? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2227.7000000000003s)]
*  Could somebody come and take it? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2229.5800000000004s)]
*  And if somebody did take it, who would that be? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2230.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the batting title in the Ted Williams era, right? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2233.34s)]
*  Like this is just feels like this is going to go to him. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2236.42s)]
*  But, you know, in the piece, I looked at some potential young players [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2238.98s)]
*  coming along and there's some surprising names [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2242.86s)]
*  that, you know, there's the Devin Bookers of the world that you think of. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2246.46s)]
*  But, dude, I'll give you a name that is really relevant for the playoffs, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2250.5s)]
*  who is suddenly an incredible jump shooter, and that's Anthony Edwards, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2253.9s)]
*  who is combining volume and efficiency and age. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2257.78s)]
*  I would throw that in there at a ridiculous level. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2262.3s)]
*  And some people are in the season sort of lamented the fact that this hyper [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2265.5s)]
*  athletic, you know, highlight machine was taken so many threes, but he's good at it. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2269.26s)]
*  And so he comes to mind as somebody who like it or not, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2275.3s)]
*  could be the best shooter in the NBA in four or five years. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2278.86s)]
*  If he continues this trajectory, I mean, I don't know if you saw the stats, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2283.1800000000003s)]
*  but like very few players in NBA history have had more than 300 threes in a season. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2286.7000000000003s)]
*  And now he's on that list and he creates a lot of them. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2292.42s)]
*  And specifically with a step back bill, which is a very difficult shot [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2296.74s)]
*  that only players like Luca and Stefan and Harden have really been able to do reliably. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2300.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, he's actually hitting that at a rate that's better than all those guys. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2306.7799999999997s)]
*  And that really caught my eye this year. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2311.02s)]
*  So Anthony Edwards could take the torch in a weird way. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2312.58s)]
*  I would not said that last year, but doing the research for the piece, I was like, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2317.1s)]
*  it's undeniable that this guy is ahead of schedule as a jump shooter. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2321.02s)]
*  I looked at his stuff long and hard because I was debating. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2325.62s)]
*  I gave him a test drive for that last first team on the spot. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2329.2999999999997s)]
*  I gave him a test drive for fifth spot MVP. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2333.02s)]
*  So I was looking at all the stats. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2337.62s)]
*  First of all, he won the three point title this year for three pointers made, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2340.02s)]
*  which Curry has owned. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2343.74s)]
*  If Curry's healthy, he just says he just wins that every year. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2345.06s)]
*  As long as he plays 68 games, you know, 65, whatever. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2349.06s)]
*  Edwards hit 320, Malik Beasley at 319, Curry at 311, and nobody else had over 266. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2354.1400000000003s)]
*  But I don't think people realize how many threes he takes and makes. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2360.26s)]
*  Like people like us realize it, but I don't think if you ask the average person on the [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2365.26s)]
*  street who made more threes this year, Steph Curry or Anthony Edwards, I don't think [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2370.1000000000004s)]
*  anyone would say Anthony Edwards. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2373.9s)]
*  So you have that. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2375.82s)]
*  But he also took, took, uh, he made 415 free throws, which was six. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2377.2999999999997s)]
*  He took 496 free throws, which was fifth. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2384.74s)]
*  So he's moved into that kind of late 2010s. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2389.02s)]
*  James Harden, Harden was the all-timer for this, but threes and free throws. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2393.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2398.18s)]
*  A little bit of that, but then he's also doing all this other stuff, including the [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2398.5s)]
*  defense, um, and the athleticism. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2402.2999999999997s)]
*  And I just, I was really, really happy with, uh, where we landed in this aunt [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2405.42s)]
*  journey and now we have this Lakers series where we're going to find out. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2411.94s)]
*  Can he, can he go up a little bit of a level here? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2415.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2418.5s)]
*  And that's, it's, it's a perfect stage for him to, to, to, to check in and see [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2418.7400000000002s)]
*  if where he's at, because there's a chance that the wolves will win this series and [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2423.46s)]
*  he's going to be just the, the, the, the star of the show on, on some of the biggest [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2427.54s)]
*  stages in the first round of these playoffs. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2432.06s)]
*  Um, and you know, when he came out of Georgia and was the number one pick, I [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2434.6200000000003s)]
*  didn't think that he would be the best shooter in sort of his cohort of early [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2440.1400000000003s)]
*  twenties players. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2444.34s)]
*  I didn't think that was going to happen. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2445.1000000000004s)]
*  I always thought I was going to be an athlete. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2446.46s)]
*  Um, but he's great. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2448.6600000000003s)]
*  And then the other name you mentioned that I don't think people quite realize [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2450.38s)]
*  how great of a shooting season we just had was Malik Beasley. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2453.1800000000003s)]
*  And if you look at just the catch and shoot stats, it's better than any clay [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2456.82s)]
*  Thompson season, except for one. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2462.1000000000004s)]
*  Like Malik Beasley, it's not an exaggeration to say when you look at the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2464.26s)]
*  volume of threes he's taking and the percentage he's making, it's like having [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2469.26s)]
*  clay Thompson out there. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2475.0600000000004s)]
*  In fact, it's like a better version of clay Thompson for most of clay Thompson's [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2476.3s)]
*  career. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2480.34s)]
*  Uh, and I think that helps explain what's happened in Detroit. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2481.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, the sort of, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2484.26s)]
*  he's doing at the end of games too. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2485.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2488.1400000000003s)]
*  And he doesn't even start, which is why he's a six man of the year candidate. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2488.5400000000004s)]
*  Um, but he finishes a lot of games and he gives Cade Cunningham a, just a [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2491.86s)]
*  great spacing weapon. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2495.94s)]
*  Um, but it's also just a, uh, you know, Malik's been a great catch and shoot guy [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2497.86s)]
*  in the league for a while. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2502.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2504.06s)]
*  He had one down year in the Lakers. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2504.3s)]
*  Um, but this is not, this is, he's taken it to another level. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2506.42s)]
*  So he's another one that sort of popped in this awards and gave him the best [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2510.3s)]
*  catch and shoot guy. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2513.3s)]
*  Cause I don't think people realize, and we'll see that in a big series too, with [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2514.46s)]
*  the New York Knicks too, Bill is, is can he continue this under the bright lights? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2517.5s)]
*  I couldn't believe that he wasn't the favorite for six million of the year. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2523.06s)]
*  I voted for him. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2526.94s)]
*  I voted for him over Prichard. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2527.7400000000002s)]
*  I watched, I obviously watched the Celtics the most. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2529.02s)]
*  I thought Prichard had an excellent, excellent season off the bench, but [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2531.86s)]
*  Beasley, you know, the Celtics could survive whether Prichard was good or not. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2535.1s)]
*  He could go one for eight for three points and it just wouldn't matter. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2540.02s)]
*  The Pistons couldn't survive, he's having a bad game against a good team. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2544.2999999999997s)]
*  Like they actually really, really needed him. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2548.22s)]
*  He was probably, you know, Durin is their second most important player, I think, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2550.8599999999997s)]
*  because of all the, the rim protection rebounding, the alley-oop stuff that he [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2554.8199999999997s)]
*  gives them and Beasley's probably, it's probably two A Durin and two B Beasley. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2559.3799999999997s)]
*  Um, but with the shot and I've talked about it before, but the shocking thing [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2564.54s)]
*  was how they would run offense for him in big spots at the end of the games. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2567.5s)]
*  Like they, they really would come out of timeouts and be like, we're running [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2571.58s)]
*  this play and you're going to like that same way you would treat Clay Thompson. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2575.06s)]
*  So to me, it wasn't close. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2578.46s)]
*  I thought, I didn't think it was close. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2580.98s)]
*  I thought he was clearly six man of the year. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2582.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2585.46s)]
*  Anybody doubts go to basketball reference and look at Clay and then look at Malik. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2585.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, there've been only nine instances of a player hitting more than 39% of their [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2589.86s)]
*  threes while also hitting more than 300 threes in a single year. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2594.7799999999997s)]
*  Curry's done it six times. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2599.3s)]
*  Clay's done it one time. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2601.46s)]
*  And then this year, Bill, Anthony Edwards and Malik Beasley both did that. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2603.34s)]
*  Um, so I think that was a stat that was like, oh my God, yeah, there's more threes [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2608.5s)]
*  than ever, nobody wants to hear me complain about that anymore. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2612.86s)]
*  I get it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2615.5800000000004s)]
*  But we're seeing the emergence of more of these great shooting campaigns. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2616.5s)]
*  And this year it was Beasley and Edwards. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2621.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2624.7000000000003s)]
*  He, you know, one of the things that screws up the six man stuff when you look at it [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2624.94s)]
*  is some guys will have these games as starters and their stats will jump way up [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2630.82s)]
*  when they're the starter. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2634.9s)]
*  And then when they're the reserve, the stats are different. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2635.9s)]
*  You can look at all this stuff with the splits easily. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2637.86s)]
*  It didn't really matter. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2640.66s)]
*  He was just as impactful. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2641.5s)]
*  No matter how many minutes he got, when he brought them off the bench, he started 18 [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2643.38s)]
*  games, stats were like four points better, but it wasn't dramatic. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2646.54s)]
*  Um, and he was, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2650.54s)]
*  didn't have what a Pritzard had that one game where he had like 45 against Portland. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2651.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2655.7s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2655.9799999999996s)]
*  Naz read had a couple of those where he started and had big games. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2656.3799999999997s)]
*  Beasley was, you know, he averaged 16 points a game and I don't think he played. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2660.2599999999998s)]
*  Did he play? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2667.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm looking at it now. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2669.14s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2670.02s)]
*  27.8 minutes. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2670.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2673.66s)]
*  Shot 41.6 from three. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2674.2599999999998s)]
*  Took nine a game. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2677.06s)]
*  Like that's, these are crazy numbers for a six man. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2678.14s)]
*  It's one of the better six man seasons we've had. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2680.74s)]
*  So, uh, any other shooting seasons stand out for you? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2682.8999999999996s)]
*  Uh, well, relevant to this weekend, I'm going to say Tyler Harrow, uh, has had a [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2686.22s)]
*  breakout year, but he's, he's, he's mastered the floater, which is really interesting. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2692.22s)]
*  Uh, and kills, kills a lot of drop coverage and he's just the best at that. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2697.4199999999996s)]
*  The floater sort of replaced the pull up jumper for young guards, you know, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2702.5s)]
*  Chris Paul's generation would always pull up at the elbow off two feet. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2706.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh, Tyler Harrow and, and, and John Moran's generation is definitely like [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2711.18s)]
*  running towards the basket, throwing up the floater, um, the stats back that up. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2715.06s)]
*  And this year, nobody has been better than that than Tyler Harrow. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2719.54s)]
*  And, you know, I think in the Butler absence, if you look at the Miami [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2722.9799999999996s)]
*  heats numbers over the last 15, 16 games, their numbers jump off the page. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2727.74s)]
*  And I think whoever wins that game in Chicago has a really good chance bill [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2733.66s)]
*  of taking the eight seat in the East, um, from Atlanta. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2741.5s)]
*  And I think Tyler Harrow and the heat. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2747.02s)]
*  I forgot we're not done with that linear. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2750.1s)]
*  We have them again. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2751.82s)]
*  We, we, we were saying goodbye to them for the year, but now we're [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2756.58s)]
*  going to have them again. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2759.74s)]
*  And both Chicago and Miami are playing above that nine, 10 level right now. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2761.2599999999998s)]
*  And so I think whoever wins that game is going to have a lot of [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2766.8599999999997s)]
*  momentum going into Atlanta. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2769.94s)]
*  And I could see that being Miami. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2772.66s)]
*  Um, and I could see Miami going into Cleveland and stealing a game. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2775.22s)]
*  So I noticed, by the way, I noticed the same thing with Miami cause that line [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2779.22s)]
*  it's, I think it's like Chicago by one. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2783.66s)]
*  I loved, I loved Orlando tonight and I also like Golden State, but they were [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2785.98s)]
*  favored by like six, seven, not amazing. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2790.62s)]
*  Like, I think, I think the two favorites are going to win tomorrow's [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2792.98s)]
*  a harder match of games. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2795.8599999999997s)]
*  And I really liked the Chicago thing. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2798.54s)]
*  I think they're fun to watch, but the same thing you, you made the key point [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2800.18s)]
*  with Miami, the numbers are pretty good for them just as last 15 and bam. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2803.98s)]
*  I think finally looked like bam and had a couple of real kick-ass games, but in [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2809.74s)]
*  general, you know, a couple of times they played teams that are trying to [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2815.18s)]
*  tank stuff like that, but, um. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2817.7799999999997s)]
*  I just would be surprised if they lost tomorrow. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2821.38s)]
*  I'll say that. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2823.58s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2824.7799999999997s)]
*  I think I'll go a step further. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2825.2999999999997s)]
*  You have Spoh, you have these guys that have gone very far in the [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2827.3399999999997s)]
*  playoffs, still on that roster versus a Chicago group that you can't say that about. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2831.42s)]
*  Um, so I feel like I am picking Miami. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2837.14s)]
*  You know, I, I like Chicago again. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2841.2599999999998s)]
*  I think they're playing better than, than, than the nine spot right now. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2842.7799999999997s)]
*  Giddies hurt and playing, which that part makes me nervous. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2847.02s)]
*  Where he's like questionable, but he's going to play it. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2850.66s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2853.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2854.8599999999997s)]
*  And then, yeah. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2855.18s)]
*  So I, I love that, but I was hero. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2855.9s)]
*  What else in the piece is interesting? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2857.8199999999997s)]
*  Uh, by the way, the other one I, I, I refused to make a pick, but if you [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2859.62s)]
*  actually forced me to make a pick, I'd probably take Sacramento. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2863.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2869.46s)]
*  I don't feel great about it though. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2870.06s)]
*  The last thing from the shooting piece that I think you'll enjoy is the best [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2871.9s)]
*  shooting big man in the NBA this year. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2876.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2879.46s)]
*  He'll remember a couple of years ago, Carl Towns claimed to be the best [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2879.7s)]
*  big man shooter of all time, uh, which [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2883.3399999999997s)]
*  that wasn't true. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2885.74s)]
*  What, what happened? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2886.54s)]
*  So did we debunk that [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2887.62s)]
*  to those of us who watch basketball before 2000, there were other good [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2889.2999999999997s)]
*  shooting big men before towns. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2892.66s)]
*  I didn't realize. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2894.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, Dirk Nowitzki. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2894.9399999999996s)]
*  I forgot. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2895.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2896.5s)]
*  The MVP who won a title. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2897.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2899.4199999999996s)]
*  But Nicole Jokic among his many feats is literally the most efficient [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2899.7799999999997s)]
*  jumpshooter in the NBA among all the people that took 400 jump shots this [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2905.1s)]
*  season, which I forget 98 players. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2909.62s)]
*  So of the 98 players that took at least 400 jumpers, nobody's more [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2911.46s)]
*  efficient than Nicole Jokic. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2916.06s)]
*  But he also are in that doesn't include that he was like 42% from three. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2918.14s)]
*  That includes the three. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2923.14s)]
*  It includes all jump shots. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2925.2999999999997s)]
*  And I think that is an astounding fact. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2927.06s)]
*  Uh, I know you and Ryan are debating the MVP votes. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2930.94s)]
*  Uh, but I didn't know that going into that, but just, I'm not debating anymore [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2935.22s)]
*  because we had to mail it in today. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2939.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2941.42s)]
*  And you went, you ended up with Nicole, right? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2943.06s)]
*  I'm going to save it for Thursday's pod. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2946.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2948.7799999999997s)]
*  But you bet you, I mean, some of the stats with them, like that shooting [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2949.42s)]
*  stat you just mentioned, there's like nine different things you could say about his [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2953.8199999999997s)]
*  season from either using counting stats or advanced stats that are just dumb [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2958.86s)]
*  founding. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2964.62s)]
*  I mean, nobody had, I'm pretty sure nobody had been in the top five in points, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2965.7s)]
*  assists and rebounds per game in the same season. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2970.74s)]
*  And he's in the top three, but he was also second in steals. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2973.7799999999997s)]
*  And then he also shot 42% from three. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2979.14s)]
*  And then he was also like, it was like a 19 point difference when he was on or [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2982.1s)]
*  off the court offensively for them. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2986.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, it's just like, you start going through this stuff and it was like, he [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2989.18s)]
*  did eight things that just don't happen. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2992.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2995.66s)]
*  Ever. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2995.94s)]
*  That's, I think the last one you said for me, I really think the MVP vote comes [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=2997.66s)]
*  down to how you look at the word value invaluable in this context. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3002.34s)]
*  And for me as a stats guy, those on-off differentials with, with, with the [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3006.7799999999997s)]
*  Joker are so extreme that it proves to me that way I think of value. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3012.06s)]
*  And again, I think this is a year where we have really unique two candidates. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3018.22s)]
*  Both are deserving. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3022.58s)]
*  By the way yet a plus candidates. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3024.1s)]
*  This is not a, I have to talk myself into an MVP player. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3026.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3030.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3031.02s)]
*  But, but, but I always come back to, and I think you alluded to this [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3031.74s)]
*  with the two through 12 thing. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3035.18s)]
*  But yeah, like when Nicola is sitting down for the Denver nuggets, they're [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3037.5s)]
*  immediately a lottery, they're immediately a lottery team until he takes off the [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3042.58s)]
*  towel and stands up and goes to the score's table and comes back into the [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3046.9s)]
*  game and then their playoff team again. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3049.98s)]
*  It's did you vote for the ringer? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3052.18s)]
*  100? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3053.9399999999996s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3054.4199999999996s)]
*  You make the list or is it too tense for you? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3056.14s)]
*  Well, I sent my last list and, um, it's interesting. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3059.66s)]
*  So a hundred players. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3066.54s)]
*  I obviously took it seriously and really tried to rank everyone [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3068.3399999999997s)]
*  correctly and put time into it. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3071.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3072.98s)]
*  See had seven of the top 96 for me. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3073.3799999999997s)]
*  They had number two, 17, 18, 62, 65, 79. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3076.7s)]
*  And 96, because I put case on Wallace in my top hundred. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3082.02s)]
*  Cause I think he's unbelievable. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3085.8599999999997s)]
*  Um, Denver had one 41, 60 and 78. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3087.66s)]
*  And I had, I didn't, Jamal's not even the top 40 for me at this point, just [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3095.1s)]
*  cause he's been so erratic this year, you know, and it, and it, even when he starts [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3098.3799999999997s)]
*  playing well, then he gets some dumb injury again and that, you know, you, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3101.9399999999996s)]
*  the league is so deep, you start comparing him to like somebody like Desmond [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3105.2999999999997s)]
*  Bain tonight, you know, who's had a really good season and showed up when it really [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3109.54s)]
*  mattered. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3114.38s)]
*  Um, but anyway, the point is, uh, I thought that was interesting. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3115.06s)]
*  This, this one jumped out at me too. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3120.02s)]
*  I had seven Houston guys, my top hundred, 31, 43, 72, 73, 81, 83 and 95. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3121.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not nothing. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3130.66s)]
*  And then you look at golden state six, 28, 40, and we're done. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3132.06s)]
*  It's three guys. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3136.42s)]
*  You know, so that's not everything, but it is kind of instructive when you start [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3137.26s)]
*  looking at talent in a big picture of guys, teams compared to other teams. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3141.1000000000004s)]
*  And one team has seven top hundred guys. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3147.34s)]
*  The other team has three now, granted, one of them is number six. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3149.7000000000003s)]
*  And it's one of the themes for me, the season two bill is like, if you look at [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3154.7400000000002s)]
*  the top four teams, top two and both sides, there's, there's something in common. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3157.7400000000002s)]
*  Is they're all pretty young. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3161.6600000000003s)]
*  I think the Boston Celtics have a couple older guys. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3163.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3166.02s)]
*  And Drew. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3167.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3168.42s)]
*  But like, when you look at the absolute core of the calves, the Celtics, um, but [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3168.94s)]
*  also obviously in the West, the Rockets and, and, and the Thunderous young man's [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3174.98s)]
*  game, dude, it's a young man's game. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3179.86s)]
*  And in these playoff series, like where I can see myself talking, talking myself [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3182.38s)]
*  into the Rockets, beating the warriors is like, dude, there's just these young [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3187.74s)]
*  bucks who have a lot more energy or a lot more resilient, like when John turned his [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3192.22s)]
*  ankle and like for an older player, that's probably the game, right? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3196.2999999999997s)]
*  You can't come back from that. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3200.18s)]
*  That's like a week. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3202.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3203.06s)]
*  You're, you're coming off on the wheelchair. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3203.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3205.8599999999997s)]
*  Those are the moments. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3206.18s)]
*  Uh, and I think there is a case for depth being more important than ever right now [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3207.2999999999997s)]
*  in the NBA and I think the Rockets have that in the, in the warriors don't. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3212.62s)]
*  Um, but yeah, I think that's an interesting way to look at it. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3216.4199999999996s)]
*  Playoff matchups too is who has the most depth and what you just said about the [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3218.9s)]
*  Rockets is another reason I'm going to talk myself into taking them, I bet. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3222.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3225.58s)]
*  I mean, they're bringing in Tari Asin for 17, 18 minutes a game. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3225.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's just like, it's like you're unleashing him for those minutes and it's [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3232.1400000000003s)]
*  like, Oh, let's put him and Thompson together. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3237.58s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3240.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3241.02s)]
*  I hate any of these guys. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3244.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3246.7s)]
*  I don't know what I'm going to do. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3246.9s)]
*  I hate any series taking the team that doesn't have the best player. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3247.9s)]
*  The words clearly have the best player. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3252.18s)]
*  And then when you saw how Jimmy could flip the switch tonight with all the [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3254.14s)]
*  time off between the games, but the warriors, the fact that Steve doesn't seem [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3257.1s)]
*  to really trust what his roster is makes me nervous because I felt like he had a [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3261.9s)]
*  handle on it three weeks ago. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3266.06s)]
*  It really did. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3267.74s)]
*  I felt that Laker game when they beat the Lakers a couple of weeks ago. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3268.2999999999997s)]
*  And I was like, Oh, this team knows who it is. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3272.42s)]
*  They knew who their guys are. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3274.54s)]
*  Now we're heading into the playoffs and I'm not sure they know. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3275.66s)]
*  So I guess we'll find out. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3279.7s)]
*  We'll find out, man. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3281.2999999999997s)]
*  Um, yeah, so I kept you up too late. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3282.7s)]
*  We're going to go. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3285.98s)]
*  And this is unless you got any university of Texas updates for us. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3287.8199999999997s)]
*  No, I mean, it was great to see the Longhorn Corey Joseph back on the [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3292.1s)]
*  television screen tonight. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3296.8599999999997s)]
*  I haven't seen Corey Joseph. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3298.02s)]
*  There's our update. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3300.1s)]
*  It was a Corey Joseph update. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3300.8599999999997s)]

*  Nice little salt and pepper. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3309.86s)]

*  Thanks for staying up with them. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3313.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3315.06s)]
*  My friend, Nick Conn is here. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3315.34s)]
*  He is the president of WWE. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3316.7000000000003s)]
*  They have WrestleMania coming up. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3318.46s)]
*  Do you want to hear my WrestleMania 40 years ago story? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3320.34s)]
*  Please. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3323.1s)]
*  I didn't have a lot going on. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3323.94s)]
*  Um, no girlfriends to be seen. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3325.7000000000003s)]
*  And the fact that they had a WrestleMania pay-per-view with [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3328.2200000000003s)]
*  Hulk Hogan and Mr. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3331.02s)]
*  T was in the running for biggest thing that happened to me in [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3331.86s)]
*  1985, maybe not related to the Celtics or Boston team. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3334.78s)]
*  Uh, couldn't wait. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3338.34s)]
*  Felt like there was a real moment where wrestling fans were kind of shoved to the side. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3340.38s)]
*  We were kind of at the kids' table. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3346.34s)]
*  We weren't doing the booger eaters. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3347.74s)]
*  We weren't taking seriously. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3348.98s)]
*  And then also an MTV and Hogan. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3349.94s)]
*  And it's like, no, no, no, now it's our time. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3352.14s)]
*  The wrestling fans matter, but you're also a wrestling fan. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3355.18s)]
*  So you remember it. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3357.62s)]
*  By the way, WrestleMania one was so big. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3358.54s)]
*  You watch it, I assume on closed circuit. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3360.42s)]
*  We, we somehow had had cable in Connecticut because I was going to high school in [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3363.34s)]
*  Connecticut. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3367.0600000000004s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3367.7400000000002s)]
*  We somehow were able to order it on cable and watch it that way. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3368.1800000000003s)]
*  But I don't think everyone, everyone had that option. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3371.46s)]
*  Some people had to go to like weird closed circuit places. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3373.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3375.82s)]
*  I was closed circuit LA sports arena because at that time we were living [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3376.1000000000004s)]
*  in Los Angeles as kids. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3380.1400000000003s)]
*  So what was, what was the crowd, the most fired up for it? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3381.6600000000003s)]
*  The LA sports arena. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3384.54s)]
*  You know, look, the Hogan, Mr. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3385.7000000000003s)]
*  T, which snooker in the corner. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3387.7400000000002s)]
*  Against Orndorf Piper and Bob Orton in the corner was huge, but that Andre, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3389.66s)]
*  the giant moment, there's something about that. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3394.3799999999997s)]
*  I think it was $15,000 body slam challenge or body slam match with John stud. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3396.54s)]
*  That felt big also. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3400.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3402.2999999999997s)]
*  The closed circuit era is so hard to explain to young people. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3402.3799999999997s)]
*  I saw, I saw Duran Leonard one. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3405.8999999999996s)]
*  I saw 1981, I saw Hearns, uh, Leonard 19, the Boston, Boston garden closed circuit. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3409.66s)]
*  So that was what November, 1980. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3417.42s)]
*  One something like that. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3419.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3420.5s)]
*  Um, saw that in the garden and just about everybody was rooting for her. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3421.18s)]
*  And so that was outraged. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3426.06s)]
*  But by the, think about it, like we would pay tickets to go watch TV in an arena. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3427.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3432.3799999999997s)]
*  And like a really crappy screen. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3432.62s)]
*  And it wasn't even, it wasn't like it is now. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3434.2999999999997s)]
*  Like if you did like a watch party now, it's great. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3436.3799999999997s)]
*  It's great. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3439.1s)]
*  Now, but it was a blurry screen back then. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3439.5s)]
*  You have watch parties now. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3442.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3443.58s)]
*  We have a lot of international watch parties with Netflix for the upcoming [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3443.8199999999997s)]
*  WrestleMania. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3447.42s)]
*  We did deal with Cosm. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3448.54s)]
*  If you know Cosm, of course I don't. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3449.98s)]
*  Cosm is a, it's sort of like a sphere like bar and lounge. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3452.6200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3457.1800000000003s)]
*  It's in a few select cities, including Los Angeles, Atlanta, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3457.58s)]
*  WrestleMania will be there. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3460.86s)]
*  It's already sold out, but it's a great viewing experience. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3462.3s)]
*  So we do them and we do them domestically as well. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3465.26s)]
*  Well, I want to talk about WrestleMania in a second, but since, since the last time [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3467.9s)]
*  you came on, we actually finished the Mr. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3471.26s)]
*  McMahon documentary for Netflix. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3473.6600000000003s)]
*  It was a multi-year Odyssey. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3476.54s)]
*  I still can't believe it. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3478.54s)]
*  It ran, uh, six episodes, six hours, a big history of the WWE. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3479.6600000000003s)]
*  Vince was prominently involved. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3485.6600000000003s)]
*  You guys were, Vince was gone at that point, but, um, the whole situation was [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3487.26s)]
*  pretty weird. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3493.1s)]
*  And I think pulling it off was one of the craziest achievements I've ever been [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3493.82s)]
*  involved with. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3498.2200000000003s)]
*  I still can't believe it actually aired. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3498.78s)]
*  It felt like it was dead seven times. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3500.46s)]
*  A lot, a lot, but by the way, it's a testament to you. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3503.42s)]
*  It's a testament to Netflix, you know, to get that done. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3505.9s)]
*  Obviously in getting it done, the latter part, which you just referenced was [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3509.98s)]
*  quite bumpy, you know, for everybody, uh, but it got done and it seemed to get, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3513.7400000000002s)]
*  you know, quite high viewership numbers on Netflix. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3517.98s)]
*  So what was the response like internally and like, you're in charge of WWE, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3520.3s)]
*  you're doing this giant documentary. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3524.46s)]
*  That's, you know, it's warts and all of a pretty controversial guy who's [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3526.7000000000003s)]
*  involved in a big legal proceeding. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3531.1800000000003s)]
*  And did you get people going like, why are you doing this? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3533.26s)]
*  Why hasn't this been killed? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3536.06s)]
*  Episodes one through five, it was all fine. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3538.3s)]
*  And then, you know, episode six obviously had a lot of, you know, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3541.9s)]
*  tawdry allegations in there. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3545.34s)]
*  So, you know, the most important thing at the company was, hey, this is not [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3547.34s)]
*  for us to spike it. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3551.58s)]
*  That's not what the deal was. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3553.02s)]
*  And the deal that was struck with Netflix was prior to me joining WWE on a [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3554.86s)]
*  full-time basis. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3559.26s)]
*  So it was sort of trying to help everyone stay calm who was watching it [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3560.62s)]
*  and, hey, we'll get through this thing and get to the other side of it, which [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3564.7799999999997s)]
*  hopefully, you know, now we are. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3568.46s)]
*  What was the kind of, what kind of feedback did you get from people on it? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3569.9s)]
*  It went everywhere from, hey, it was phenomenally done like you did with [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3573.02s)]
*  Andre, uh, the giant documentary on HBO sports to, oh my God, you know, this [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3577.1s)]
*  thing, uh, you know, it's not true. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3581.98s)]
*  It's not factual, you know, this and that there were people who loved it, uh, as [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3584.62s)]
*  an objective, whole objectively told profile of a person and people who were [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3589.66s)]
*  close to the subject who didn't like it, which, you know, I understand that I [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3594.94s)]
*  would think you understand. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3598.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was, uh, it certainly ran the game of emotions. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3599.98s)]
*  I was really proud of how it was done. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3603.3399999999997s)]
*  I thought, and I thought it was the hardest thing I've ever been involved [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3604.8599999999997s)]
*  with just to, just to make, especially when the story kept changing. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3608.46s)]
*  My compliments to you. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3611.98s)]
*  There were a lot of bumps in there. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3613.02s)]
*  There were a lot of, you know, it was not easy and you stayed steady. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3614.7799999999997s)]
*  You got through it as did Netflix and you know, here we are. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3617.98s)]
*  You know, these things are documents. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3621.34s)]
*  I feel the same way about the Celtics thing we're doing right now, where it's [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3623.7400000000002s)]
*  like, you know, you, you hope that 20 years from now, people watch it. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3626.38s)]
*  It'll be some sort of snapshot of what happened, but we're happy with the way [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3630.38s)]
*  the Celtics one turned out. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3634.62s)]
*  I really was actually. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3636.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3637.5s)]
*  I mean, that's, that's different because these big ass documentaries spread over [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3637.98s)]
*  a bunch of years, like they, they, there's a certain level of expectations [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3642.86s)]
*  that come with them now. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3646.3s)]
*  And you kind of have to exceed those people just assume they're going to be [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3647.26s)]
*  infomercial or so they're not going to be good. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3651.82s)]
*  And they're prone, they're prone to not want to watch it over what you [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3653.42s)]
*  almost have to convince them. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3656.38s)]
*  No, no, this is a good one. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3657.34s)]
*  You should watch this. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3659.1000000000004s)]
*  So I'm proud of it though. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3660.1400000000003s)]
*  Look, for whatever it's worth, I too thought it was phenomenal. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3661.98s)]
*  I put it up there and HBO sports, you know, as you know, you're one of the [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3665.02s)]
*  co-creators of 30 for 30, but HBO sports was the sports documentary home for [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3669.1000000000004s)]
*  everything prior to 30 for 30, that bird verse magic, you know, documentary [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3674.62s)]
*  that Ezra did 10, 15 years ago, whatever that was 15, I thought that was the [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3680.06s)]
*  best basketball documentary I had seen. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3684.7799999999997s)]
*  It's excellent. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3686.94s)]
*  I put this one up there with that. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3687.82s)]
*  And I also loved once brothers. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3690.38s)]
*  I'm not suggesting. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3692.22s)]
*  Yeah, we did that one. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3693.18s)]
*  I know you did. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3694.7799999999997s)]
*  That was a fun one. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3695.34s)]
*  Loved it. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3696.3s)]
*  I thought it was a deep emotional story, but the Celtics one, it was not [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3696.7799999999997s)]
*  told simply through the lens of a fan. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3700.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3703.58s)]
*  Which I think I don't want to say was difficult for you. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3703.98s)]
*  I wouldn't know that, but I know you're a huge Celtics fan. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3706.62s)]
*  So to be able to tell the story objectively, you know, warts and all was impressive to me. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3709.34s)]
*  Yeah, we wanted to do like just have an interview, a hundred people tell the story [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3713.34s)]
*  of the city as it intersected with the team. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3718.06s)]
*  And, you know, I think I've been trying to do these and we felt that same way [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3720.3s)]
*  when we did the Vince one. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3723.58s)]
*  You don't just want to tell the story. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3724.46s)]
*  You want to also be levitating above it, trying to actually say something. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3726.14s)]
*  I think that's when it gets hard. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3729.82s)]
*  And like in wrestling, there's been so many documentaries at this point, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3731.74s)]
*  just about everybody's been done and they've been kind of varying degrees of quality. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3735.9799999999996s)]
*  And the ones that seem to resonate the most, there's like two different audiences for it. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3740.3799999999997s)]
*  There's like the diehard wrestling fans who like dark side of the ring and all the [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3745.8199999999997s)]
*  nitty gritty stuff. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3749.8999999999996s)]
*  And they're just going to eat those up and those are basically for them only. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3750.7s)]
*  And then the question with the wrestling stuff is how do you get like our wives to watch? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3754.06s)]
*  How do you get like our kids to watch? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3759.9s)]
*  How do you get a much bigger audience for it than just the people that were going to [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3761.98s)]
*  watch it anyway? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3765.02s)]
*  It's totally look, it's sort of the same thing we try to do weekly with WWE. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3765.7400000000002s)]
*  You're going to have the hardcore fans who watch, you know, no matter what. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3770.3s)]
*  And they'll either love it, hate it, or they're somewhere in between. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3774.14s)]
*  And then you try to broaden the audience as I think, or at least I hope that we have over [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3777.02s)]
*  the last number of years to get people like your son back into it. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3781.82s)]
*  He's out again. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3786.14s)]
*  We got to talk about this. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3787.1s)]
*  Well, I thought he's coming to WrestleMania. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3788.06s)]
*  He is, but he's, you know, all the stages he's in the state, the stage now where the [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3789.58s)]
*  next stage will be like age, what 24 when all of a sudden you come back hard. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3795.1s)]
*  I'm going to have to have a private conversation with him. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3800.06s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to have to, you might have to pile drive him. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3802.22s)]
*  We'll have to have a private conversation with you and me on the side with them at [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3804.2999999999997s)]
*  WrestleMania. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3807.18s)]
*  He's excited to go, but it's not, he's not on it like he used to be. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3807.42s)]
*  He's above it now. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3810.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3812.06s)]
*  I got too cool for it. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3812.54s)]
*  I understand. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3813.58s)]
*  But he, but the thing is he's not too cool. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3814.22s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3816.06s)]
*  No one's too cool for wrestling. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3817.02s)]
*  It's the cycle of being a wrestling fan. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3818.38s)]
*  So now he's here and then eventually he'll be back here. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3820.3s)]
*  I know I've mentioned it before, but WrestleMania, I think it was 2016 in Dallas. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3823.02s)]
*  So your son would have been nine years. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3829.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3831.82s)]
*  My son was nine. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3831.98s)]
*  That was the wheelhouse for him. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3832.78s)]
*  You were sending me videos from your hotel room of him doing Ben, your son doing all [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3834.3s)]
*  the wrestling moves on your guys' hotel bed. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3839.7400000000002s)]
*  Now my son, who you know, Sonny is nine. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3842.54s)]
*  So I get to experience that firsthand and seeing him, my son do all the things Ben [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3845.58s)]
*  was doing nine years ago. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3850.46s)]
*  Well, and then Sonny also, when we saw him, he deceived us on what the, um, what the [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3852.2200000000003s)]
*  WrestleMania was going to be. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3857.98s)]
*  So you've already trained him to, to swerve people, trust little kids with information. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3859.1s)]
*  We thought we were getting inside info for how WrestleMania was going to play out. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3864.06s)]
*  And what he told us wasn't true. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3868.38s)]
*  I really respected it. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3869.82s)]
*  Well, by the way, there's a precursor to that conversation. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3871.1s)]
*  He said to me, Hey, if Bill Simmons asked me what's going to happen in Royal rumble, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3873.9s)]
*  do we trust him? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3878.94s)]
*  Do we tell him? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3879.7400000000002s)]
*  I said, we trust them, but we don't tell them. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3880.62s)]
*  And he said, okay, then I'm going to tell them. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3883.1s)]
*  Cena's taking the whole thing. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3884.46s)]
*  And I said, okay, great. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3885.6600000000003s)]
*  He never said any of that, but I'm just kidding. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3887.34s)]
*  I wouldn't believe that, but that's what happened. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3889.58s)]
*  He told us Cena was winning Royal rumble and we were like, wow, Nick Khan's kid. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3891.5s)]
*  He's got to get that kid in line. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3897.1800000000003s)]
*  He told us the wrong thing or he told us the right thing. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3900.3s)]
*  And then it turned out to be the wrong thing. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3902.94s)]
*  Listen, someone in this room and to the listeners, there's only two of us in this room. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3904.3s)]
*  It's only years ago. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3908.14s)]
*  Hey, keep in mind, everybody tells somebody. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3909.02s)]
*  So, you know, it's the Jacoby trust triangle, the Jacoby trust triangle. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3911.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3915.02s)]
*  So we had to keep it tight. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3915.34s)]
*  That's, yeah, was not winning the world rumble. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3916.62s)]
*  So that was the biggest decision you guys have made with a character in the company. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3919.18s)]
*  I don't even know since when this was somebody that you protected for 20 years. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3927.5s)]
*  You never turned them over. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3931.58s)]
*  He was always a good guy. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3932.7s)]
*  Even as the crowd, he's polarizing and his 50 50, but that was the cool thing. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3933.8199999999997s)]
*  But he always tried to stand for something. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3938.06s)]
*  He was a role model. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3940.2999999999997s)]
*  It helped. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3941.74s)]
*  The thing I always heard was the merchandise made it so much easier to just sell a bunch of stuff [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3942.3799999999997s)]
*  because there was always this next generation of kids coming. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3947.2599999999998s)]
*  And then you finally turned them right near the end out of nowhere. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3950.62s)]
*  So here's what I thought was interesting about that whole process. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3953.2599999999998s)]
*  Number one, John Cena's merchandise still off the charts. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3956.3799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3959.58s)]
*  Top of show at every event or almost every event, the sort of collective decision to [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3960.3s)]
*  make that heel turn. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3966.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3967.7400000000002s)]
*  Triple H, Cena, Dwayne Johnson, Cody, everyone immediately on board with the whole thing. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3968.86s)]
*  Had they pushed Cena to do that before or no? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3977.98s)]
*  Not since I had been at WWE and not since Triple H had been in charge of creative. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3981.1800000000003s)]
*  So I don't know, you know, 10, 15 years ago, you know, perhaps, but certainly not in the [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3986.86s)]
*  last five years. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3990.78s)]
*  Because when they did it at WCW with Hogan, that was kind of a form of desperation. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3991.58s)]
*  Like he was really Peter Hocomania had petered out with WWE and then was petering out with [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=3997.5s)]
*  WCW again. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4002.46s)]
*  And they flipped it at the perfect time and just, you know, started it as you know, one [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4003.34s)]
*  of the greatest heel turns in the history of wrestling. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4007.98s)]
*  But as you just articulated, sort of had to be done. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4010.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4013.6600000000003s)]
*  Cena on his, you know, final run with us, you even saw the fans prior to the heel turn, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4014.06s)]
*  the ones who were saying Cena sucks and we love Cena. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4022.06s)]
*  There was no more Cena sucks. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4025.26s)]
*  It was 98% overwhelmingly positive reaction to John Cena for at least the last couple [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4027.1s)]
*  of years. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4032.78s)]
*  So to do it when again, Triple H and Cena and everyone else decided to do it, I thought [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4033.66s)]
*  was phenomenally and phenomenally effective and really smart. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4039.18s)]
*  Yeah, because we went to the show in LA the day before the fires, which seems like it [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4042.54s)]
*  was seven years ago and had this, you guys had your first Netflix show. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4046.7799999999997s)]
*  Cena, there was a popularity with him that I, it felt like a little nostalgia tinged [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4053.2599999999998s)]
*  with. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4058.62s)]
*  We kind of know this is the end and it was probably the most tied into him that I felt [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4058.86s)]
*  like I had seen a crowd in a long time where people were like, we love this guy. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4065.2599999999998s)]
*  We know we can see the finish line now. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4069.18s)]
*  And it was one of, that was the two legacies from that night were that and then Hogan [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4070.86s)]
*  just got booed out of the arena, which I can't imagine you guys ever thought would happen. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4075.34s)]
*  Right? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4079.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4079.98s)]
*  Look, it was also rock showed up that night, Travis Scott with Jey Uso, if you remember [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4080.1400000000003s)]
*  him coming through the crowd, you know, doing sort of the Yig thing, you know, with Jey, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4085.5s)]
*  I thought there were a number of moments that resonated, but yes, Cena sort of announcing, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4089.98s)]
*  it had been announced, but sort of physically announcing like, hey, this is it. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4095.1800000000003s)]
*  This year is going to be it. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4099.0199999999995s)]
*  And you're not going to see me again in the WWE wrestling ring. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4100.62s)]
*  You'll see him across our stuff, you know, well past the end of this year, but to turn, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4103.58s)]
*  if that was January 6th, elimination chamber was March 1st. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4108.78s)]
*  And that's when the big yield turn was over the course of seven weeks, you know, massive, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4113.5s)]
*  massive turn. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4117.339999999999s)]
*  We always talk about with wrestling. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4117.98s)]
*  It's like the NBA where you have like draft classes or eras or generations and the talent [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4120.379999999999s)]
*  kind of ebbs and flows. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4125.179999999999s)]
*  And I can't tell. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4127.1s)]
*  I think that the company right now seems like it's as successful as it's ever been. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4128.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4133.5s)]
*  And it seems like wrestling, at least for you guys, the WWE version of it is the most [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4133.820000000001s)]
*  successful it's ever been. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4138.54s)]
*  I don't know how much of that is how you've handled the behind the scenes the last five [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4140.46s)]
*  years, you and Triple H and some others, or is it just a talent boom? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4146.14s)]
*  Obviously it's both, but what's the seesaw like being smart behind the scenes versus [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4150.860000000001s)]
*  like, if you had this much talent, it's probably going to happen anyway. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4155.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4159.5s)]
*  Like what's the seesaw? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4159.66s)]
*  I think, look, to me, it always comes down to the talent and the creative. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4161.1s)]
*  That's what drives WWE. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4164.78s)]
*  So if you think about it, Roman Ryan's went through, you know, some illness and came out [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4166.7s)]
*  on the other side of that positively. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4172.38s)]
*  CM Punk had left the company as you know, 10 plus years ago, and it seemed like he would [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4174.54s)]
*  never return. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4179.9s)]
*  He returns. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4181.26s)]
*  Dwayne Johnson hadn't wrestled. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4182.3s)]
*  You know, he showed up at the SmackDown premiere on Fox if it was 2019, 2019 at what was the [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4184.3s)]
*  Staples Center, but he hadn't done anything, you know, long-term with us in a long time. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4191.26s)]
*  Cody Rhodes had left to go elsewhere and Seth Rollins sort of elevated himself on his own. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4196.7s)]
*  Just a handful of Rhea Ripley, you know, pops. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4203.18s)]
*  Liv Morgan comes along. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4205.9800000000005s)]
*  So there's something definitely special going on with the talent right now. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4207.74s)]
*  And Roman's crew, I think, was another one. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4212.219999999999s)]
*  That was one of the best crews. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4214.54s)]
*  That's another 50, 60 years of wrestling. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4216.7s)]
*  Crews. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4219.58s)]
*  Like the four people, the five people, and it's like, oh, these guys might turn on each [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4221.58s)]
*  other. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4225.419999999999s)]
*  No, they're fine. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4225.98s)]
*  No, they might turn it. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4226.78s)]
*  That's the legacy of wrestling. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4228.139999999999s)]
*  The bloodline, to your point, it goes up there with DX. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4230.459999999999s)]
*  It goes up there with the Four Horsemen. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4233.82s)]
*  It goes up there with any of those great factions that you said, oh my God, this is special. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4236.0599999999995s)]
*  And you know it's not going to last forever. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4240.78s)]
*  But as long as it did last, it was phenomenal, phenomenal. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4242.7s)]
*  NWO before they started letting everyone in. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4245.74s)]
*  It became like the Soho House. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4249.9s)]
*  It's like, wait, is there anything special about being in this place? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4251.099999999999s)]
*  Full Soho House. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4254.46s)]
*  Everybody's getting in. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4255.74s)]
*  It's like, oh, there's Virgil. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4256.78s)]
*  Scott Norton, Vincent, not Virgil, and WCW. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4257.98s)]
*  But yes, all of that. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4261.0199999999995s)]
*  That was pretty rough. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4261.98s)]
*  They kind of lost the narrative fast. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4263.34s)]
*  Yeah, no, it seems like this is the best run, but you still needed the main guy. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4265.34s)]
*  And it felt like the big thing this decade was just getting Cody Rhodes [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4270.94s)]
*  and first of all, stealing him from your competition. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4275.099999999999s)]
*  But then also seeing that you could build him as the face of the company, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4278.54s)]
*  which I got to be honest, I didn't see. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4283.34s)]
*  I thought he could be one of the guys. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4285.5s)]
*  I didn't realize he could be the center of everything, which I think he is. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4287.66s)]
*  Yeah, I think what's really amazing about Cody's story to me [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4292.78s)]
*  is he saw it before anyone else saw it. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4296.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4299.179999999999s)]
*  And to ask to be led out of his WWE agreement, I guess it would be, you know, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4299.5s)]
*  eight or nine years ago. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4304.54s)]
*  It's a classic bet on yourself moment. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4305.9s)]
*  Classic bet on yourself. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4307.74s)]
*  And by the way, to your credit, you leave ESPN. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4308.86s)]
*  You don't have to bring me into it. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4312.3s)]
*  I'm just saying it's a bet on yourself moment. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4313.34s)]
*  But these things, when people bet on themselves and it works out, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4315.74s)]
*  and as you know, it doesn't work out for a lot of people. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4318.7s)]
*  There's a lot of people who asked out at WWE and you sort of never heard from them again. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4321.18s)]
*  A lot of people who left ESPN, you may never have heard from them again. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4325.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4328.94s)]
*  You went, you built something, you monetized it. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4329.26s)]
*  And now we're doing the podcast from your home. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4331.900000000001s)]
*  You know, eyeball test here, 24 bedrooms, this house. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4335.26s)]
*  So that's a nice accomplishment. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4339.1s)]
*  And for Cody, back to Cody, you know, he leaves. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4340.54s)]
*  He doesn't like the start us thing. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4343.34s)]
*  He thinks he can do much more than that. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4344.780000000001s)]
*  He leaves. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4346.860000000001s)]
*  He hits the indie circuit. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4347.42s)]
*  Like, so whatever he was making at WWE at that time, he left that guaranteed money [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4349.26s)]
*  to go on a night by night basis. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4353.66s)]
*  He took a full bet on himself. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4355.58s)]
*  He went. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4357.74s)]
*  He started part of another league. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4358.3s)]
*  And then you sort of saw him fade out over there. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4360.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4363.18s)]
*  And it's something that we talked about at WWE. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4363.74s)]
*  It was like, well, this is interesting. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4366.3s)]
*  It used to be, hey, this is about the wrestlers. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4367.9800000000005s)]
*  This is about empowering the wrestlers. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4370.62s)]
*  This is Cody's, one of the co-founders. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4372.860000000001s)]
*  And then that narrative shifted. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4375.1s)]
*  And that's when we decided, when we knew contractually, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4377.1s)]
*  we could make the call to make the call and say, hey, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4379.5s)]
*  why don't we get together and have a conversation? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4382.7s)]
*  The deal was done in minutes and boom, he returned. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4385.1s)]
*  WrestleMania 22 at AT&T stadium just three years ago. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4387.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4392.3s)]
*  And a year later was in the main event of WrestleMania 2023 at SoFi. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4392.86s)]
*  To his credit, he's never really talked about what [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4398.22s)]
*  happened with those guys. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4400.38s)]
*  He doesn't talk a lot of shit in a negative way, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4402.38s)]
*  which is something I admire about him. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4404.78s)]
*  He moved on, and he's in a better spot. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4406.54s)]
*  It felt like it probably got a little credit grabby over there. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4409.18s)]
*  That was just knowing nothing, just from reading and [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4412.78s)]
*  and following the breadcrumbs and reading stuff [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4415.5s)]
*  like Meltzer's Newsletter and weird shit like that [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4419.46s)]
*  where you're just like, ah, it seems like there's [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4421.54s)]
*  a lot of people in this kitchen right now claiming [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4424.74s)]
*  that they cooked the pot roast. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4427.02s)]
*  You know this shrill. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4428.54s)]
*  I saw you do it at Grantlin. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4429.86s)]
*  I saw you do it when you replicated Grantlin at the Ringer. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4433.14s)]
*  Everyone knows who the founder is. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4438.02s)]
*  You don't sit there saying, I this, I that, I this, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4439.94s)]
*  I did Spotify, me, me, me, my, this. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4442.94s)]
*  The people who do that, I've never really seen them succeed. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4445.9s)]
*  I feel like the actual leaders, they're the ones, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4449.78s)]
*  they'll take credit when something's a disaster, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4452.66s)]
*  which you should as the leader of a company. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4455.179999999999s)]
*  When something is a success, give credit to everybody else. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4457.5599999999995s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4460.099999999999s)]
*  Compliments are currency. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4461.42s)]
*  Another Dave Jacoby. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4462.94s)]
*  Jacoby? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4464.66s)]
*  James Babydoll Nixon too. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4465.5s)]
*  That's one of his mantras. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4466.379999999999s)]
*  Babydoll, one of the all time great characters [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4467.9s)]
*  in the modern history of the media process. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4469.74s)]
*  Nice compliment, nice currency. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4470.82s)]
*  We're at the Masters. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4472.38s)]
*  It's just a slew of, it's like watching the Anchorman [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4473.38s)]
*  fight with all the anchors, except nobody's fighting. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4477.1s)]
*  Everybody's trying to get along, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4479.3s)]
*  but it's all these different people competing agendas [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4480.400000000001s)]
*  being like, hey, what's going on? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4482.46s)]
*  Everyone's friends all of a sudden. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4484.3s)]
*  Do you miss that? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4485.900000000001s)]
*  Do you miss being an agent? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4486.74s)]
*  Does Babydoll smoke at the Masters? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4487.74s)]
*  It's like a chimney. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4489.5s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4490.34s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4491.18s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4492.02s)]
*  He was on fire. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4492.84s)]
*  Do you miss being an agent though? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4494.3s)]
*  Listen, I loved being an agent when I was an agent, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4495.62s)]
*  but when I decided to stop doing that five years ago, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4498.02s)]
*  that was the end of that for me. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4500.4800000000005s)]
*  I have had the good fortune of sort of being a friend [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4502.18s)]
*  of court to a number of former clients. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4505.3s)]
*  If they need advice or want advice or just friends [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4507.22s)]
*  who may want advice from time to time, I'm always happy. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4510.26s)]
*  Or you'll just hire former clients. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4512.54s)]
*  Just put them. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4514.820000000001s)]
*  Put them on camera. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4515.900000000001s)]
*  Put them in. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4516.740000000001s)]
*  Or like CM Punk, who for some reason [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4517.58s)]
*  you were always kind of involved in. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4519.38s)]
*  That was one of those where I was like, Nick's nuts. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4521.26s)]
*  Like this guy's, this guy's a cancer. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4523.46s)]
*  Like you can't let this guy, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4526.38s)]
*  and it's been, seems like it's been great. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4527.9800000000005s)]
*  By the way, it was so obvious to me [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4530.8s)]
*  that he wasn't a cancer. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4532.84s)]
*  I had, in having been an agent, assume I had dealt [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4534.8s)]
*  with some personalities that were not the easiest [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4538.28s)]
*  from time to time. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4541.2s)]
*  Sports media? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4542.04s)]
*  I can't believe that. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4542.860000000001s)]
*  That's part of the job. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4543.7s)]
*  I had always found him to be a gentleman. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4546.4400000000005s)]
*  I always found him to be honest, responsive. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4548.0s)]
*  And I felt if he was that way, outside of the company, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4551.320000000001s)]
*  if given an opportunity to come back to the company, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4555.52s)]
*  he would be that way. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4558.42s)]
*  And he said that he would be, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4559.360000000001s)]
*  and he's been a gem to work with. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4561.12s)]
*  I think, cause I certainly feel this way, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4563.12s)]
*  but myself back in the earlier days, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4565.5599999999995s)]
*  like I think when people have trouble [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4567.599999999999s)]
*  dealing with somebody who's not good [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4571.5599999999995s)]
*  or doing a bad job or has no, like, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4574.08s)]
*  and I, for some reason, back in the day, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4576.719999999999s)]
*  I would take that really personally. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4579.0s)]
*  It would make me upset. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4580.44s)]
*  I would try to fix it. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4581.4s)]
*  I would get all wrapped up in it. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4582.4s)]
*  And I think as you get older, you're like, you know what? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4583.639999999999s)]
*  Most people are terrible. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4585.679999999999s)]
*  And once you kind of realize that, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4587.36s)]
*  it's like, I just gotta navigate around it. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4589.96s)]
*  It'll be fine. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4591.4400000000005s)]
*  Once you realize that, it's a different way of living. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4592.28s)]
*  And I, for whatever reason, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4595.84s)]
*  it took me till my mid-40s to realize it. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4597.4400000000005s)]
*  I think there's a constant through line in it, Bill. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4599.4s)]
*  I think for the supremely talented people, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4601.32s)]
*  punk, yourself. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4605.4s)]
*  Oh, thanks for putting us together. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4607.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4608.52s)]
*  Yeah, two of the greats. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4609.36s)]
*  Two of the greats. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4610.18s)]
*  Thanks. Two of the greats, right? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4611.02s)]
*  Yourself, Triple H. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4612.08s)]
*  The biggest challenge is to deal with mid-level management. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4614.02s)]
*  Or lousy mid-level management. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4617.8s)]
*  Yeah. Correct, right? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4620.360000000001s)]
*  You had, I think, referred to at one point [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4621.280000000001s)]
*  as like the khaki brigade. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4623.84s)]
*  The blue shirt and khaki police. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4625.56s)]
*  The blue shirt and khaki. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4626.96s)]
*  Correct. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4627.96s)]
*  Those were more the mid-level. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4628.8s)]
*  Coming in to sit in on a meeting [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4629.84s)]
*  and have some bad ideas and screw everything up. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4632.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4634.160000000001s)]
*  And then tell us to lead with the Lakers. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4635.0s)]
*  You were young and creative and had ideas. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4635.84s)]
*  And many of them were great ideas. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4639.040000000001s)]
*  And when you come up against, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4640.96s)]
*  no different than Phil, i.e. CM Punk. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4641.96s)]
*  And you come up against sort of bad mid-level management. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4646.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4649.64s)]
*  They can stifle creativity and stifle ideas. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4650.4800000000005s)]
*  And when you're young and you've got a little bit of chip [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4652.6s)]
*  on your shoulder, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4655.400000000001s)]
*  which I think most people who end up successful do, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4656.240000000001s)]
*  it can be stifling. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4658.72s)]
*  It can cause a lot of anger. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4659.92s)]
*  Yeah. If you take incompetence personally, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4661.8s)]
*  it's probably not a great way to be. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4665.240000000001s)]
*  It's, by the way, think about it. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4667.240000000001s)]
*  When you said- [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4668.400000000001s)]
*  It's a chapter in the book I'll never write. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4669.240000000001s)]
*  When you say most people aren't great, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4670.280000000001s)]
*  it applies to every profession. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4672.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4674.240000000001s)]
*  Servers in restaurants, executives at networks or buyers. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4675.44s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4680.36s)]
*  Like club coaches in youth sports. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4681.64s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4684.0s)]
*  That's why when you find somebody [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4685.48s)]
*  that's actually really good, you treasure it. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4687.2s)]
*  No question. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4689.8s)]
*  It's like, wow, this teacher my daughter has is amazing. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4690.64s)]
*  I'm so happy this person exists. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4693.64s)]
*  It applies to everything. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4696.2s)]
*  I'm with you. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4697.36s)]
*  No, it is true. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4698.2s)]
*  Yeah. So it's been, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4699.12s)]
*  I think CM Punk probably got a little older. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4700.08s)]
*  Maybe put some stuff in perspective, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4702.96s)]
*  tried a couple of things, had a couple of failures. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4705.72s)]
*  All of those cliches apply. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4707.08s)]
*  When you said you finally, like my words, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4708.32s)]
*  calmed down on it in your 40s. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4710.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4712.24s)]
*  I'm sure Phil, I'm sure Triple H, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4713.08s)]
*  as he got older, you have children, you get married. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4714.6s)]
*  You realize sort of the don't sweat the small stuff thing [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4717.52s)]
*  that maybe you may have sweated years ago. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4719.92s)]
*  And it seemed once Phil and Triple H reconnected, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4722.0s)]
*  in my brain, it was going to be magic. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4725.8s)]
*  And boom, he reappeared or he, you know, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4728.72s)]
*  surprised everyone at Survivor Series Chicago [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4731.92s)]
*  a year and a half or so ago. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4735.400000000001s)]
*  And it's been magic since. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4736.68s)]
*  And one of the other big things you did [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4738.4400000000005s)]
*  was splitting up WrestleMania, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4739.64s)]
*  which I'd like to credit you at least partially with that one. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4741.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4744.32s)]
*  You might deserve all the credit, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4745.16s)]
*  but that was one of those things. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4746.32s)]
*  That was an idea that was sitting there for years. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4747.4800000000005s)]
*  The event was so long, you just, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4751.16s)]
*  you almost needed like an IV. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4753.08s)]
*  What you see for eight hours, my son would never move. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4756.52s)]
*  He was in that stage, you're like, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4759.08s)]
*  I'm not going to the bathroom, I'm not going anywhere. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4759.92s)]
*  And it was just these terminally long shows [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4761.44s)]
*  and the audience would die over the course of the show. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4764.04s)]
*  If the number one sport in the United States, as you know, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4766.799999999999s)]
*  is the National Football League, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4769.48s)]
*  and they effort to have three hour games [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4771.759999999999s)]
*  and a three and a half hour Super Bowl, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4773.96s)]
*  and yeah, of course, there can be overtime [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4775.48s)]
*  and longer games and all this stuff. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4777.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4778.799999999999s)]
*  Then why shouldn't we effort to do the same? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4779.639999999999s)]
*  So, you know, seven hours, eight hours of wrestling, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4781.96s)]
*  of WWE in one night is a lot. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4785.919999999999s)]
*  Well, especially the crowd is doing it. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4788.28s)]
*  They're on a rollercoaster during the thing. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4791.44s)]
*  They're excited. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4793.16s)]
*  Totally. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4794.0s)]
*  They're intense, like, you know, do you have breaks? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4794.84s)]
*  It's just that it's really, anything longer than four hours, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4797.92s)]
*  I think is really hard, right? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4800.5199999999995s)]
*  It's really hard. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4802.32s)]
*  This is also our first one, at least in the last five years. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4803.14s)]
*  That's not on final four weekend. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4806.04s)]
*  So- [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4808.68s)]
*  That was another thing. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4809.5199999999995s)]
*  This is why I get mad with the NBA. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4810.36s)]
*  You actually looked at the schedule [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4811.92s)]
*  and we're trying to figure out weekends [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4814.24s)]
*  that would be advantages for you guys. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4816.48s)]
*  Totally. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4818.4s)]
*  We've done the American only holiday weekends, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4819.24s)]
*  if you think about it, 4th of July. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4822.5599999999995s)]
*  There's such a lack of sports on that people, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4824.8s)]
*  and it's with no disrespect intended, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4828.16s)]
*  will actually watch the Nathan Hot Dog eating contest. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4830.04s)]
*  But why wouldn't we do a WWE event on that weekend? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4833.04s)]
*  So we do. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4836.08s)]
*  And Labor Day weekend, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4837.08s)]
*  even though there's early college football, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4838.12s)]
*  why wouldn't we have a big, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4839.84s)]
*  if people are like, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4841.04s)]
*  oh, well, you can't get butts in seats, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4841.86s)]
*  well, sure you can internationally. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4843.12s)]
*  It's obviously not a holiday there. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4845.0s)]
*  And now that everyone can watch on their phone, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4846.8s)]
*  it doesn't really matter what day it is, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4849.6s)]
*  as long as it's not a cluttered sports calendar. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4851.34s)]
*  I think you saw college football get into a little bit [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4853.88s)]
*  of a mess with their playoff system going, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4855.96s)]
*  right around the NFL games, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4859.52s)]
*  coming out of compelling NFL weekends. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4861.56s)]
*  Hopefully they reconfigure that, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4863.780000000001s)]
*  but it's something we put a lot of time and effort into. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4865.12s)]
*  The good news, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4867.88s)]
*  it's the only mistake college football made. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4868.7s)]
*  They've nailed everything else. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4871.360000000001s)]
*  It's been perfect with having these [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4872.860000000001s)]
*  giant ridiculous conferences [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4875.28s)]
*  and teams that are 3000 miles apart. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4876.84s)]
*  When kids are supposed to be in school, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4879.2s)]
*  flying cross country. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4880.96s)]
*  It's tough, right? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4882.219999999999s)]
*  When it's fragmented. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4883.0599999999995s)]
*  Any of these sports. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4884.3s)]
*  It makes me mad. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4885.599999999999s)]
*  The NBA is not fragmented. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4886.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a leak. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4887.82s)]
*  The NFL, WWE, we're not UFC, not fragmented. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4888.96s)]
*  There's a leak. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4892.0199999999995s)]
*  It's what even on the boxing side caused such destruction. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4892.86s)]
*  Four different sanctioning bodies, interim champion, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4897.4s)]
*  who's actually the champ, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4901.16s)]
*  all these different weight classes. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4902.36s)]
*  It's all chaos. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4903.94s)]
*  Until there's a central [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4905.88s)]
*  holding account or central boss, if you will, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4909.36s)]
*  it's gonna be tough to get any of that in line. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4912.92s)]
*  It's one thing I love about UFC. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4914.88s)]
*  It's a bass, dude. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4917.24s)]
*  It's so much easier to follow [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4918.22s)]
*  for casual fans like me. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4919.88s)]
*  I just wanna watch the pay-per-views. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4921.28s)]
*  I watch every pay-per-view. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4922.76s)]
*  I love UFC. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4924.0s)]
*  I'm not gonna watch 52 weeks a year. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4924.96s)]
*  I'll listen to Ariel's podcast sometimes. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4927.24s)]
*  I'll read some stuff occasionally, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4930.3s)]
*  but for the most part, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4932.24s)]
*  I fully admit, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4933.36s)]
*  little better than a casual fan, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4935.16s)]
*  but I'm a casual fan, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4936.599999999999s)]
*  and it's so much easier to follow [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4937.8s)]
*  when there's not 95 fucking belts. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4939.16s)]
*  By the way, look at what Dana and the Fratitas created. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4941.8s)]
*  If you ask them, they'll tell you, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4944.92s)]
*  we took everything we liked about boxing [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4946.719999999999s)]
*  and incorporated that, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4948.679999999999s)]
*  and all of the other nonsense that we hated, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4950.0s)]
*  we made sure to get rid of that. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4952.48s)]
*  Even if you haven't watched for a moment [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4954.88s)]
*  and you order a pay-per-view and you're like, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4957.599999999999s)]
*  oh, the number one contender's fighting the champion, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4959.04s)]
*  yeah, that makes sense. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4961.84s)]
*  Number three is fighting number eight, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4964.04s)]
*  and I know what the featherweight division is. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4965.88s)]
*  Cool. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4967.68s)]
*  Totally. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4968.5199999999995s)]
*  They nailed it, and that's to their credit. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4969.36s)]
*  Baseball did this almost out of necessity, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4972.5199999999995s)]
*  where they were like, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4975.4s)]
*  we have a major problem, we have to fix this. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4976.24s)]
*  There's other leagues. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=4977.88s)]

*  it was a game of baseball, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5045.76s)]

*  I don't think we've ever talked about this story before. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5054.5s)]
*  And that's, you know, Cooperstown. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5056.860000000001s)]
*  And I went there and they said, you know, we're not making a lot of money. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5058.32s)]
*  What do we need to do to fix this thing? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5061.360000000001s)]
*  I said, shut down this whole Cooperstown operation, move it to Vegas. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5063.18s)]
*  Never heard from them again. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5066.9800000000005s)]
*  Never heard from them again. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5069.76s)]
*  But to me, it was like, that was what they should have considered if they wanted it [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5071.26s)]
*  to be a year round engagement. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5075.6s)]
*  But again, that's the way they had always done it. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5077.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's the way they wanted to keep it. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5079.12s)]
*  That's a tough one. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5080.599999999999s)]
*  Cause on the one hand, every baseball fan makes the pilgrimage to [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5081.4s)]
*  Cooperstown once, but you don't do it 10 times. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5084.599999999999s)]
*  Fine. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5087.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5088.2s)]
*  By the way, travel it, do something with it, but don't do what you're currently doing. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5088.64s)]
*  Now it feels you're right. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5092.96s)]
*  There should be a big version of it, but you guys, the WWE hall of fame was an [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5094.16s)]
*  idea that's sitting there forever. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5098.72s)]
*  And that hasn't happened yet. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5100.16s)]
*  But it's happening this Friday. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5101.88s)]
*  Stand by the way, see you disrespect Triple H. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5103.64s)]
*  Triple H is being in. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5106.84s)]
*  Oh, the brick and mortar hall of fame. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5107.8s)]
*  You're saying I want the actual, I can walk into it. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5109.4800000000005s)]
*  I can go around. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5113.04s)]
*  There's videos. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5114.04s)]
*  There's, I mean, maybe you could be the ones that finally did the [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5115.12s)]
*  pantheon idea that I've always wanted to do with the levels. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5118.240000000001s)]
*  Listen, if you're like your five level hall of fame and you get to the top level [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5121.2s)]
*  and it's just like Hogan, San Martino, like all the great greats, who's your [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5124.64s)]
*  Mount Rushmore for wrestling? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5128.56s)]
*  Should we wait until my dog starts barking? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5132.12s)]
*  Whatever we can bring them in. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5134.0s)]
*  Whatever you want to do. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5135.16s)]
*  Um, Hogan has to be in it. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5136.04s)]
*  San Martino, John Cena, Rick Flair. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5139.16s)]
*  Yeah, I get that. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5148.12s)]
*  Cena is probably the shaky spot. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5149.4400000000005s)]
*  I think Hogan, Hogan and Flair have to be in it. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5151.68s)]
*  No Austin for you. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5154.68s)]
*  It's a, it's a pretty brief apex. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5156.84s)]
*  Yeah, shorter run. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5159.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5161.04s)]
*  In five years, you know, I think rock potentially, but rock is [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5161.28s)]
*  another one where the actual apex wasn't long enough. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5165.56s)]
*  Like if you go to hall of famer, the career has to be part of it. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5168.200000000001s)]
*  Like, like Flair and Hogan, how long they lasted was amazing. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5173.56s)]
*  And even San Martino wasn't as long as those guys. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5177.52s)]
*  Who do you, who do you think it is? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5179.400000000001s)]
*  Flair, Hogan for sure. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5180.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5182.56s)]
*  And then as you just sort of articulate in a different way, the final two are [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5182.96s)]
*  tough, Cena deserves some sort of recognition that you're talking about a [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5186.360000000001s)]
*  20 year run, what Romans done the last couple of years. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5190.400000000001s)]
*  Thinking of it. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5194.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5195.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's definitely in the conversation now. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5195.68s)]
*  Tremendous. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5198.4800000000005s)]
*  And then you think back, you know, San Martino was just before me, but you [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5198.84s)]
*  would read in pro wrestling illustrator, he held the championship for this period [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5203.56s)]
*  of time and superstar Billy Graham, you know, came along in this and that, but [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5207.64s)]
*  definitely Flair and Hogan, um, I would put Austin somewhere around there just [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5212.08s)]
*  because of the impact he had. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5217.92s)]
*  I think if I'm remembering correctly, he retired at like 39 with injury and, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5219.64s)]
*  you know, all of those things rocked left early to go pursue a different career [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5224.48s)]
*  and was doing movies like the tooth fairy and it was in the get shorty [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5229.0s)]
*  sequel, you know, paid played like a [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5232.839999999999s)]
*  buckler. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5234.719999999999s)]
*  His extra five years when he was just kicking ass, like basically Hogan's [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5235.0s)]
*  late eighties, I think the two, the two biggest apexes were Hogan and Stone Cold. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5239.16s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5244.12s)]
*  That I would, I'm not just saying that as like a WWE Homer, WCW never had [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5245.32s)]
*  anything like that. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5250.08s)]
*  No, it's um, and by the way, and rock obviously went on to monumental success. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5251.2s)]
*  His, his feud with Hogan. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5256.52s)]
*  I mean, with, uh, with, uh, Vince, when that really hit it's like there's been, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5259.04s)]
*  there's nothing like that. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5264.72s)]
*  It was rejuvenated the entire company. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5265.76s)]
*  Can't miss TV. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5267.76s)]
*  And you think about it, you had Austin Hogan, rock, triple H DX, Mick Foley, and [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5268.68s)]
*  oh yeah, you had undertaker Kane and all those other guys as well. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5275.88s)]
*  Just an amazing, amazing bench that all hit at once. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5279.0s)]
*  Well, the other thing with, with Hogan and Stone Cold, it's the only two times [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5283.08s)]
*  they shifted the actual popular culture. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5286.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5290.04s)]
*  Hogan definitely in the eighties and he's part of this whole patriotism boom [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5290.4400000000005s)]
*  that's like sliced alone and Schwarzenegger and like we're Russians are the bad guys. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5294.8s)]
*  And we were like big USA, like he was right in the middle of that. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5299.8s)]
*  And then Stone Cold, right as we tried to cover this in the Vince doc a little [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5302.64s)]
*  bit, um, right as something was shifting in America and people were just getting [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5306.76s)]
*  edgier in general, and he just felt like he was one of the people, him and DX felt [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5311.280000000001s)]
*  like they were at the forefront of something. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5315.92s)]
*  NWL was like that too, but he was at the top of it of like, it's okay to be the [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5317.4800000000005s)]
*  anti-hero when you think about like him as an anti-hero, which hadn't really [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5321.72s)]
*  happened in wrestling before. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5327.16s)]
*  Um, I mean, there are pieces of it in different guys, but nobody had been like, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5328.92s)]
*  I'm going to just own this and I would have been a heel 10 years ago, but now [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5332.360000000001s)]
*  everyone's rooting for me. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5335.68s)]
*  Then it moves into the Tony Soprano. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5337.08s)]
*  I was just going to say that's kind of what TV became in the 2000s. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5339.56s)]
*  He was like the first one. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5343.08s)]
*  The precursor. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5344.200000000001s)]
*  So when everyone says, well, Tony Soprano was the first anti-hero, you know, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5344.92s)]
*  that you're rooted for. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5348.76s)]
*  No, it was 100% Stone Cold. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5349.56s)]
*  Correct. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5350.4800000000005s)]
*  It was Stone Cold. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5351.200000000001s)]
*  It shows you WW was ahead of the game. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5352.0s)]
*  And sometimes, you know, Paul Levesque and I will sort of, you know, semi joke, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5354.240000000001s)]
*  like life is WWE, WWE is life. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5358.68s)]
*  It's our product is great when it's reflective of the times, which you just [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5361.879999999999s)]
*  articulated through Hogan and the Reagan, you know, era with Arnold and sly and all [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5367.08s)]
*  that. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5371.48s)]
*  And then in the Clinton era with the proliferation of cable news and information [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5372.04s)]
*  and what was going on in the white house at the time and the Jerry Springer show. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5377.4s)]
*  And this then people, there was more of a populist movement where people who [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5381.879999999999s)]
*  hadn't had a voice before were starting to have a voice. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5385.679999999999s)]
*  And I think to your point, DX and Stone Cold both reflected that. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5389.24s)]
*  Do you feel like, like you could argue now there would be a moment to tap into [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5393.44s)]
*  that, but where the UFC is seems to be the one that's tapping into this, this [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5398.48s)]
*  side of the universe, right? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5403.4s)]
*  You could see all the people that were at UFC the other night. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5405.32s)]
*  And it's, it's been this side. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5408.2s)]
*  That was one of the reasons Trump won the election again. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5409.88s)]
*  Um, but this, this whole movement basically against the far left, but [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5412.48s)]
*  wrestling has avoided it this time around. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5417.12s)]
*  Yeah, wrestling is avoided, but it was interesting because two weeks after two [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5419.12s)]
*  weeks, give or take after the Netflix raw into a dome premiere, you and I were both [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5423.08s)]
*  at the UFC fight at the end to a dump in the heart of LA, you and me there. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5428.24s)]
*  And it's as many, you know, LA is probably as left as it gets at this moment in time. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5433.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5439.12s)]
*  Place was sold out. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5439.48s)]
*  And remember the main event, you know, fell apart, you know, a couple of days [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5440.56s)]
*  beforehand, boom, Dana and the UFC move quickly. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5443.84s)]
*  They put in, you know, another opponent, no one asked for a refund, packed house, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5446.76s)]
*  huge crowd, huge gate. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5451.68s)]
*  I think their product appeals to everybody. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5453.2s)]
*  Just like the WW product appeals to everybody. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5456.24s)]
*  It just happens to be that the CEO of UFC is a close friend of the president. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5458.88s)]
*  So you have seen definitely as an attitude of, we don't judge, we don't judge over [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5463.72s)]
*  here in UFC come in. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5467.400000000001s)]
*  If you like, if you like watching people in the octagon, welcome aboard. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5468.84s)]
*  But by the way, that's, that's how Los Angeles used to be. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5472.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5475.4400000000005s)]
*  It used to be, if you've been married 10 times, don't worry about it. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5475.8s)]
*  Move here. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5479.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5480.04s)]
*  Like Jerry bus. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5480.12s)]
*  We don't, we don't, we don't judge the Lakers owner does his own stuff. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5480.88s)]
*  We don't care. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5484.320000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5484.88s)]
*  Who was the, uh, the producer on karate kid wine, trop went like two wives or [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5485.400000000001s)]
*  something like that. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5490.4400000000005s)]
*  Remember we had the Simpson and Bruckheimer. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5491.16s)]
*  There's like a million of, yeah, but like, I think this guy in particular, there [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5492.8s)]
*  was an HBO documentary on him. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5496.8s)]
*  He had like two wives at once. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5498.16s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5499.8s)]
*  Not like, Hey, get divorced and this. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5500.240000000001s)]
*  And by the way, it was like, Hey, that's your life. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5501.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5504.320000000001s)]
*  I don't, and I still feel that way. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5504.56s)]
*  I still, I have nothing to do with that. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5507.0s)]
*  You have nothing to do with me. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5509.0s)]
*  Live your life. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5510.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5511.160000000001s)]
*  And somehow LA shifted a little bit outside of that. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5511.400000000001s)]
*  I think UFC stayed consistent. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5514.4800000000005s)]

*  I'm just talking from a combat standpoint, but you don't have the boxing piece yet. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5563.24s)]
*  But then, I mean, the last time you were on the pod, we talked about this and this [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5567.56s)]
*  is your favorite sport and it feels like. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5570.68s)]
*  Just me know nothing from afar. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5575.52s)]
*  It feels like there's a boxing opportunity slash momentum for something for somebody [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5577.64s)]
*  to corral at least a big piece of it. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5583.52s)]
*  And you talked about it last time. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5586.52s)]
*  Are you any closer? [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5587.96s)]
*  Well, I think, I think you caught the announcement, you know, Dana, myself, uh, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5589.4800000000005s)]
*  our partners, uh, Turkey, I'll shake to create a new boxing promotional [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5596.68s)]
*  company a couple of months ago. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5601.08s)]
*  I did. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5603.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5604.24s)]
*  But nothing's, nothing's happened with it yet. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5604.8s)]
*  Well, you can announce whatever, but do you still need, like to me, it's like, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5608.2s)]
*  okay, they're going to do this. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5612.36s)]
*  That means they're going to acquire something, but you haven't [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5613.6s)]
*  acquired the something yet. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5615.84s)]
*  No, nothing, nothing to be acquired. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5617.28s)]
*  We're going to grow it organically, but I'd look for if we're, you know, mid [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5619.0s)]
*  April now, I'd look for a big announcement on that the next four to six weeks as [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5622.5599999999995s)]
*  to what our first card's going to be and who's going to be on that card. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5626.48s)]
*  This is all going to be one-off stuff. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5629.72s)]
*  Not like something that potentially has a chance to be UFC WWE. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5631.24s)]
*  No, we want it to be UFC and WWE like, but you'll see an [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5635.92s)]
*  announcement with more to come. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5640.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't mean to intentionally be cryptic on the whole thing. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5642.08s)]
*  It could be as cryptic as you want, but we have a plan. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5644.76s)]
*  Now, because I saw the first thing and I'm like, all right, they're just, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5647.36s)]
*  just kind of planning a flag when nothing is actually happening. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5651.12s)]
*  But now you're saying something's going to happen. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5653.679999999999s)]
*  That's that. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5655.679999999999s)]
*  That's the thought. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5656.36s)]
*  That's the hope we'll see. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5657.08s)]
*  What are the opportunities in boxing right now? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5658.88s)]
*  I think, look, as other than cohesion. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5661.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5664.84s)]
*  It's been proven, you know, with the UFC, people like to see a good fight. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5665.639999999999s)]
*  They just have to know as with the UFC, who the fighters are. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5669.04s)]
*  It's same with WWE. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5672.48s)]
*  If you get invested in the fighters in UFC, which they've done a phenomenal job [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5674.28s)]
*  of doing UFC has, if you get invested in the wrestlers and WWE, more likely you [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5677.88s)]
*  tune in more likely to show up. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5683.08s)]
*  It's the same thing in boxing. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5685.0s)]
*  If you know, Max Kellerman, who you and I both known for a long time, he used to [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5686.72s)]
*  say, if you pull up to a four way stop sign on one corner, a guy's putting a golf [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5691.52s)]
*  ball, the other guy's throwing a football, the other guy's shooting a basketball [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5695.6s)]
*  and the other two guys are fighting. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5699.24s)]
*  What are you going to watch? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5700.84s)]
*  You're going to watch the two guys fighting. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5702.0s)]
*  He said, but the problem with boxing is you pull up to that same corner and it's [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5703.28s)]
*  Tiger Woods in his prime putting the golf ball and it's Jordan in his prime [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5707.24s)]
*  shooting the basketball and it's my homes throwing the football and it's two guys [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5710.84s)]
*  you've never heard of fighting. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5714.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5715.84s)]
*  Then it's a different choice. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5716.08s)]
*  That's the issue with boxing. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5717.92s)]
*  It's a series of one-off events where as soon as the fight ends, it's Dana White [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5719.84s)]
*  says it often, uh, it's a going out of business sale, let's charge you the most [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5725.0s)]
*  we can for one night, let's give you the least in return. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5729.4s)]
*  No good undercard fights, no reason to sit in your seat other than 10 minutes [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5733.36s)]
*  prior to the main event. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5738.36s)]
*  And Hey, if the main event's bad, then if you feel that we stole your money at [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5739.8s)]
*  home on pay-per-view, no big deal. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5743.36s)]
*  That's on you. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5744.92s)]
*  If you do it the opposite way of all of that, then you have a chance of actually [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5745.96s)]
*  building a product that has some sort of viability. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5749.96s)]
*  The Saudis I think have, have shown a little bit of the blueprint [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5753.32s)]
*  because the cards are better. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5757.639999999999s)]
*  And the card they had in, what was it? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5759.44s)]
*  February was awesome. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5761.04s)]
*  Even though they had, you know, one fight fallout last minute, they had to [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5762.28s)]
*  fly out of shape, Boccoli, my guy. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5765.639999999999s)]
*  Hey, you're sad, Boccoli got, Boccoli got paid. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5767.639999999999s)]
*  He took one hit, his trainers like we're done. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5771.24s)]
*  And, uh, you know, we escaped. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5773.96s)]
*  Now here's the good thing about what Turkey is doing there. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5776.12s)]
*  He's bringing Boccoli back. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5778.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5779.759999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5780.24s)]
*  That's what you should do. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5780.4s)]
*  If you step in on a fight on short notice and you lose the fight, give the guy [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5782.0s)]
*  another chance, you don't have to be 30 and O for it to matter. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5785.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5789.639999999999s)]
*  Well, that's what we grew up with. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5790.28s)]
*  Of course. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5791.599999999999s)]
*  Everyone fought everybody. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5792.44s)]
*  You and I didn't know Marvin Hagler as the WBA middleweight champion. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5793.88s)]
*  We knew him as the middleweight champion. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5798.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5799.759999999999s)]
*  And he fought her and he fought Durant and he fought Leonard and he fought some [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5800.12s)]
*  of them again and the best fought the best. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5804.88s)]
*  It's the same with Ali Foreman Frazier. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5807.2s)]
*  I think it's somebody like Ken Norton. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5809.48s)]
*  Like he fought everybody. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5810.84s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5811.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5812.36s)]
*  And by the way, he fought Ali three times. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5812.8s)]
*  Think, think about that, by the way, he also fought, um, it was Foreman Lyle [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5814.44s)]
*  and then Foreman Norton or was it Cooney Norton where Cooney destroyed Norton? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5820.36s)]
*  That was the end of Dorn. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5825.24s)]
*  That was the end of, yeah, that was a like 1980 range. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5826.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5829.48s)]
*  And those are all heavyweights, obviously not the Hagler group, but the other [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5829.639999999999s)]
*  group we're talking about, like just have the best fight, the best. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5833.12s)]
*  It's that simple. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5836.04s)]
*  It's what the Saudis have done. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5837.28s)]
*  It's what the UFC and Dana White have done. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5838.759999999999s)]
*  If it can be replicated in boxing, Hey, you have a winning hand. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5841.759999999999s)]
*  That sounds pretty enticing. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5845.639999999999s)]
*  How has Netflix changed your business? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5846.759999999999s)]
*  Well, the scope of it. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5850.5599999999995s)]
*  Number one, their default is yes. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5851.92s)]
*  On anything that you ask for it's yeah, sure. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5854.44s)]
*  We'll get on it right away. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5857.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh, I always say this about the executives. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5859.16s)]
*  I like the most. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5861.36s)]
*  I don't have any of their office numbers. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5862.36s)]
*  You call them sell to sell. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5864.5599999999995s)]
*  It's sort of like with you, I call you, Hey, I'll call you right back. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5866.4s)]
*  Or give me an hour. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5869.12s)]
*  You pick up and you know, we have the conversation. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5869.88s)]
*  Do you even have an office number? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5872.4s)]
*  No. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5873.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, same. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5874.16s)]
*  I don't have one. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5874.759999999999s)]
*  So they're phenomenal. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5875.839999999999s)]
*  It's also their, their power, their brand. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5876.719999999999s)]
*  And I know this is going to sound really naive. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5879.839999999999s)]
*  I didn't realize globally that it's the same interface that it is at home. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5881.879999999999s)]
*  So, you know, sometimes if you travel internationally, you're like, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5886.12s)]
*  where do I find the NBA game? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5888.4s)]
*  And you're looking and you can't find it. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5889.879999999999s)]
*  It's the same avatar that you have at home and your kids avatar and your [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5892.16s)]
*  wife's avatar, and you click into it and it shows you, Hey, here's where you [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5896.599999999999s)]
*  paused and watching all the other things. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5900.16s)]
*  It's the same exact interface. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5902.5199999999995s)]
*  So I liked the user accessibility. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5904.5199999999995s)]
*  We certainly love 300 million plus subscribers. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5906.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5909.2s)]
*  That says households by the way. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5909.64s)]
*  So assume that 700 million plus people. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5911.08s)]
*  And you've seen our international ratings go through the roof in a number of [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5914.52s)]
*  different countries, because again, easily accessible. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5918.4800000000005s)]
*  Were you surprised that you, it seems like every week you're trending as like [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5921.32s)]
*  the number one TV show for 36 hours. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5925.0s)]
*  I'm always pleasantly surprised by that. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5928.92s)]
*  I was surprised by that. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5930.6s)]
*  Here's why I said, I feel like in anything in your business and our business, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5931.64s)]
*  like the clock resets at midnight for a reason. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5935.96s)]
*  You know, no matter how good or how bad the day was the day's over. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5939.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5942.56s)]
*  And you have to go and replicate it again and try to build something even bigger [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5942.76s)]
*  the next week or the next show. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5946.4s)]
*  It's the same for you in what you do. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5948.12s)]
*  Same for us. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5949.84s)]
*  So, you know, we're proud of that, but every week we're sort of anxious to [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5951.0s)]
*  make sure that it stays that way. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5955.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5957.72s)]
*  I think talking to the Netflix people, I think the pleasant surprise for them [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5957.92s)]
*  was people watching it, like the people in Europe waking up sometimes it's [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5961.56s)]
*  coming on their sleep, but waking up and watching them getting these pockets [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5967.04s)]
*  of viewership from when either people woke up or pockets of viewership from [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5971.24s)]
*  people they didn't expect would get up early to watch it or stay up late and [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5975.4s)]
*  just watching how the different parts of the world interacted with it. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5979.32s)]
*  Um, I know that there's some, some areas that they were probably hoping. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5983.12s)]
*  Maybe you had a star that you could develop that would be [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5988.92s)]
*  exciting for that specific area. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5992.76s)]
*  Yeah, look, it's part of our recruiting for the last year or so. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5994.48s)]
*  It's, you know, you can't just pipe out American content [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=5997.32s)]
*  globally and internationally. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6001.32s)]
*  So, you know, if you look at Axiom, who's on the NXT roster, he's a [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6003.0s)]
*  Spaniard born in Spain when he showed up at our show in Barcelona unexpectedly [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6008.48s)]
*  two, three, four weeks ago, whatever it was, crowd went crazy. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6014.5199999999995s)]
*  People like their own and that's good. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6018.44s)]
*  Even if you look at the collaboration we're doing with TNA and Joe Hendry, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6021.24s)]
*  he shows up at our Glasgow show. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6025.719999999999s)]
*  People love that. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6027.96s)]
*  Obviously Drew McIntyre main roster for us on the Glasgow show. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6028.84s)]
*  People love that. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6032.32s)]
*  So it's the, the, the unique aspect about WWE is for our talent. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6033.32s)]
*  It's as much about marketability as it is ability. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6038.76s)]
*  If you can, if you're marketable and you have charisma and you have the it factor, [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6041.92s)]
*  we can sort of help with the rest. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6046.12s)]
*  And then yes, every so often you'll get someone who has both John Cena, Roman [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6048.04s)]
*  you don't want to cross and which has been crossed a couple of times. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6053.08s)]
*  It was like, we really want to get this part of the world going and watch this. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6056.0s)]
*  And then if the person doesn't have the chops gets a little dicey. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6060.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6065.52s)]
*  Look, the, the, the height of what can work. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6065.72s)]
*  And this is the obvious one. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6068.52s)]
*  When you had Bret Hart and Owen rest in peace and the faction with British [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6070.08s)]
*  bulldog and all of that, and you would see even like the Montreal screw job, if [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6074.360000000001s)]
*  you will, like that was in Canada. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6078.72s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6081.4400000000005s)]
*  That that happened. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6082.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6082.72s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6083.08s)]
*  Where Brett was and is a hero. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6084.0s)]
*  And at that time, even if he was sort of perceived as the heel in the United [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6086.96s)]
*  States, you know, Hey, I looked down on what wrestling has become, which was all [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6091.28s)]
*  part of his character, you know, at that exact moment in that exact city, just [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6094.72s)]
*  phenomenal, phenomenal content. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6099.92s)]
*  So if you were going to create stars from scratch and you could pick any part of [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6101.76s)]
*  the world, I would assume India and Brazil would be two big ones. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6105.84s)]
*  Throw Mexico in there. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6110.08s)]
*  And Mexico. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6111.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6111.84s)]
*  Those would be your three. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6112.64s)]
*  For sure. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6113.4800000000005s)]
*  So anyone listening from those countries, get your shit together. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6113.88s)]
*  Hit Bill on Instagram or Twitter, whatever it is, since I'm not on any of those [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6117.320000000001s)]
*  platforms and send your audition tapes. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6121.4800000000005s)]
*  And he'll really start smart. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6123.68s)]
*  Stay off social media. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6125.400000000001s)]
*  Not great. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6126.52s)]
*  Better. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6127.12s)]
*  Um, what are any other big predictions for the year for WWE? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6127.4400000000005s)]
*  So our deal with Peacock is coming up in 11 months. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6131.8s)]
*  They've been phenomenal partners. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6134.88s)]
*  Again, WWE as you know, uh, was on our, what we're called pay-per-views became [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6136.4800000000005s)]
*  premium live events, uh, they were on WWE network until 2020 when we did deal [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6141.52s)]
*  with Peacock and they have a bunch of your library, a bunch they've outperformed, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6146.8s)]
*  uh, our expectations. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6151.96s)]
*  We'd like to think we've outperformed, uh, their expectations and now we'll sit [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6153.84s)]
*  down together and see if there's business to be done moving forward. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6158.160000000001s)]
*  Is it better to even have stuff on a streamer like that versus like, how do [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6161.320000000001s)]
*  you, your YouTube, you guys were one of the first people to blow out a YouTube [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6165.68s)]
*  presence and now you have what 15 years of YouTube videos at this point, one of [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6170.32s)]
*  the biggest channels anyone has. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6175.28s)]
*  Like, is it just sometimes you think the way YouTube has grown and skyrocketed? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6176.88s)]
*  Does it just make more sense to double down on that? [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6181.799999999999s)]
*  Well, look, we, we love YouTube. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6184.44s)]
*  Uh, we have 110 million subscribers. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6186.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6188.2s)]
*  10th most subscribed to YouTube channel. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6188.799999999999s)]
*  That's not sports channel. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6190.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6192.08s)]
*  That's channel. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6192.32s)]
*  So you have, you know, ahead of it, you know, Coco Mellon, Mr. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6193.24s)]
*  Beast, some Indian music channels, but nothing sports oriented. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6196.84s)]
*  So we're number 10 there, which is phenomenal. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6200.639999999999s)]
*  Um, we're also on CW, which is a broadcast network. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6203.36s)]
*  We're also on USA basic cable in the United States. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6206.599999999999s)]
*  We're on Netflix streaming globally. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6209.48s)]
*  We're on peacock streaming domestically. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6211.599999999999s)]
*  We want our product to be available to everyone everywhere, depending [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6213.92s)]
*  on how they like to receive it. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6218.28s)]
*  Isn't that funny how different that is when, like when they launched [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6219.759999999999s)]
*  a network, what was that? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6223.799999999999s)]
*  10 years ago? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6224.679999999999s)]
*  It was in 2014. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6225.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6226.679999999999s)]
*  11 years ago. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6227.08s)]
*  I think that was when I did the pod with Triple H. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6227.759999999999s)]
*  Right around there. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6230.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, and it was, it was the right move at the right time to do that. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6231.639999999999s)]
*  And it was like, we're going to go on demand. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6236.08s)]
*  We'll own our rights. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6237.88s)]
*  People will pay for this. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6239.84s)]
*  We'll be able to build. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6241.12s)]
*  We'll make more from it this way. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6241.84s)]
*  Now the mindset is completely different. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6243.08s)]
*  We want as many people to see our stuff as humanly possible. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6245.04s)]
*  And we want to be tied to platforms where anyone can see our stuff. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6249.0s)]
*  To totally look at it. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6253.96s)]
*  First of all, in 2014, when WWE went to WWE network, which just so we're [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6255.44s)]
*  clear, obviously I had nothing to do with. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6260.12s)]
*  Yeah, you were. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6262.28s)]
*  And that was, you know, brilliant, brilliant decision. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6262.76s)]
*  The biggest scam that I've ever seen in television was the fee that in-demand [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6265.48s)]
*  dish and direct would take for pay-per-view. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6270.72s)]
*  So just to plug you in anywhere from 30 to 60% of a WWE event, of a [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6273.16s)]
*  boxing event of UFC at that time. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6279.24s)]
*  And then WWE got out of that business and UFC got out of that business [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6282.2s)]
*  and took it exclusively to Disney. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6286.4s)]
*  All to maybe the biggest thing ever. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6288.84s)]
*  Now Apple probably leads the way with Vegas where they get 30% on apps. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6290.84s)]
*  30% on apps. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6295.16s)]
*  The number one big person. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6296.12s)]
*  These guys were taking a vigorous. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6297.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6299.2s)]
*  They were 50, 50. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6299.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6300.48s)]
*  It was nice. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6300.76s)]
*  And in-demand was all the cable companies together. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6301.72s)]
*  It was like a legal, you know, consortium that would just come down on you. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6304.28s)]
*  And if you said, no, I don't want to do it at that fee. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6308.639999999999s)]
*  Great. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6310.36s)]
*  We're not going to carry a paper. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6310.92s)]
*  Then you wouldn't be able to show what you wanted. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6312.12s)]
*  Totally. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6314.16s)]
*  So streaming also fixed that and it got you out of the volatility of, well, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6314.5199999999995s)]
*  what pay-per-view numbers are we going to do this weekend? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6319.5199999999995s)]
*  What are we going to do this weekend? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6321.24s)]
*  What are we going to do this weekend? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6322.16s)]
*  So you knew with consistent subscribership, you could actually plan [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6323.36s)]
*  for a publicly traded company on what, you know, financials would be coming in. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6327.2s)]
*  I want to talk about the TV business in one second, but, um, do you feel like [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6331.759999999999s)]
*  you have a rival because like two years ago could make the case last year seemed [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6336.5599999999995s)]
*  like now and now it just seems like you guys are all powerful again and AW is [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6342.04s)]
*  not a rival in the same way. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6347.0s)]
*  It could their kind of moment. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6348.4s)]
*  Just, I have no dog in the race. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6350.28s)]
*  I don't really care, but it's just from a, from afar, it seems like their moment [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6352.16s)]
*  came and gone and they're like just firmly number two now. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6356.04s)]
*  Well, look, we're, we're always the underdog at WWE. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6358.92s)]
*  We always feel that people underestimate us, that we're looked down upon. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6362.08s)]
*  And we like it that way. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6367.08s)]
*  Like bet against us. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6368.76s)]
*  We prefer that and allow us to show you what we can do. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6370.12s)]
*  Short our stock. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6373.64s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6374.56s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6376.72s)]
*  You can literally do it. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6377.24s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6378.88s)]
*  Bet against us. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6379.32s)]
*  Bet against us. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6380.84s)]
*  You know, if you look at the stock price now, um, it's far in excess of what it was [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6381.8s)]
*  when we all started together five years ago. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6387.16s)]
*  And, you know, we're quite proud of that. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6389.76s)]
*  And at the same time, we got to keep, you know, re-earning our keep on a daily basis [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6391.08s)]
*  here. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6396.56s)]
*  So we feel like it's a good moment, but we still feel like there's a lot of room for [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6397.2s)]
*  growth in terms of the other wrestling promotional company. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6400.6s)]
*  Uh, they have a lot of talented wrestlers, uh, and we're happy about that. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6403.92s)]
*  When contractually, you know, they're available to be, you know, talked to and [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6408.04s)]
*  have conversations with assume a number of them will come over and, uh, nothing [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6412.16s)]
*  but respect for the father who finances it and owns the Jaguars and all those [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6416.4400000000005s)]
*  other things. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6422.12s)]
*  That was very pleasant. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6422.96s)]
*  Look at you. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6424.84s)]
*  So magnanimous. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6425.799999999999s)]
*  So different than when we were much younger. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6427.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6429.879999999999s)]
*  Well, your biggest issue is sometimes you don't want too much talent because you [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6430.36s)]
*  only have so many spots to put people and you end up just kind of wasting people. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6433.4s)]
*  Look, that's something we won't do. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6437.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we won't sign. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6439.799999999999s)]
*  I think that happened in the past though, maybe before you perhaps, but we won't [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6440.679999999999s)]
*  sign and bench people. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6444.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, we sign people who we want to use. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6445.679999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying bench people, but you sign somebody and then within a couple of [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6448.5599999999995s)]
*  weeks, you know, they're barely being used because you have too many people. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6451.8s)]
*  No, I was saying if another entity signs and benches people now, like that's [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6456.0s)]
*  something, not something we would do. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6459.24s)]
*  Oh, cause that is a thing that happens. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6460.72s)]
*  That's, that's what I've been told. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6462.8s)]
*  Not us. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6465.08s)]
*  Not awesome. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6465.84s)]
*  Um, from a TV standpoint, you're one of the world's most astute media watchers. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6467.0s)]
*  And we always end up talking about ESPN when we do this stuff. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6473.360000000001s)]
*  But since the last time we talked, Netflix is in sports in a huge way, as, as [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6475.8s)]
*  you personally know, Amazon's in, we had this whole basketball deal shake out. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6481.12s)]
*  And it feels like everything is moving toward streaming stuff. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6486.0s)]
*  And the networks are kind of holding on for dear life and overpaying to keep, uh, [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6492.04s)]
*  keep up the fight, most notably ESPN, which we, I think it's had a really rocky [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6497.0s)]
*  couple of years, um, and for what they paid with basketball, especially. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6501.28s)]
*  There's probably going to be some repercussions with that and other parts. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6506.92s)]
*  And it seems like they've moved behind like big talent contracts, a couple of [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6509.84s)]
*  big right fees, and then try to cut costs elsewhere, almost like a movie where [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6514.400000000001s)]
*  you're like, we want to get our four guys for the poster and we'll get a really [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6519.280000000001s)]
*  good director, but maybe we can save money over here. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6521.96s)]
*  What do you see the future of the, of the networks that you used to work with? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6525.52s)]
*  I think, look, you know, Netflix was saying years ago, we're not going to get [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6529.4400000000005s)]
*  in sports, we're not going to get in live. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6532.76s)]
*  Uh, and I think anyone who was following it, who had a reasonable point of view, [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6535.64s)]
*  knew that was just a temporary position. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6539.28s)]
*  And obviously Netflix knew that they went in with the unscripted shows, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6541.719999999999s)]
*  the after shows live, they went in with the Chris Rock comedy special, you know, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6546.8s)]
*  live, and I think they saw the power of it so much so that when Gabe Spitzer [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6550.88s)]
*  got hired to run sports, I don't know that they had any sports rights. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6555.96s)]
*  And all of a sudden they wake up with the Mike Tyson fight and WWE and NFL [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6559.759999999999s)]
*  games and their own hot dog eating contest and Hey, more and more is coming. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6565.16s)]
*  Uh, and that's my understanding. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6569.92s)]
*  So immediately overnight, they become an impact player. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6571.5199999999995s)]
*  I thought they did a phenomenal job with even with the halftime show [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6574.599999999999s)]
*  for the two NFL games, they go all in. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6577.5199999999995s)]
*  It's one of their superpowers. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6581.04s)]
*  And Amazon does the same. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6582.76s)]
*  Totally. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6584.2s)]
*  And you saw Amazon again, this sort of a tease Amazon went into tennis in [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6585.0s)]
*  the UK and parts of Europe early. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6589.2s)]
*  Let's see if we can do it. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6591.64s)]
*  Let's see what it looks like. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6592.72s)]
*  And then boom, Hey, we're going all in with the NFL and then boom, the big NBA deal. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6593.88s)]
*  So you're seeing, you know, the power of live, you know, the power of sports, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6598.84s)]
*  you know, you're at the top of the heap in the media business in terms of [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6602.400000000001s)]
*  your knowledge about all of that. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6607.0s)]
*  What about what happens when more folks get into it? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6609.16s)]
*  You saw YouTube with their Sunday ticket, you know, deal. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6612.36s)]
*  So I think for the traditional buyers, they need to have run smart businesses [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6616.28s)]
*  at the same time, they have to be competitive and they can't expect that, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6620.92s)]
*  Hey, you know, years of doing it one way. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6624.36s)]
*  Well, this is how we've always done it. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6627.36s)]
*  As you said earlier, you know, here today, so we've always done it. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6629.08s)]
*  Why would we do it any differently? [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6632.04s)]
*  If the universe has changed, you better change with it. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6633.6s)]
*  If not, you're going to be left behind. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6636.36s)]
*  So we'll see who gets left behind. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6638.16s)]
*  Well, they, they missed on UFC for a while and then belatedly got into it. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6639.88s)]
*  And that's been okay. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6644.24s)]
*  Although those rights are coming up, right? [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6645.08s)]
*  Well, think about it. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6646.64s)]
*  HBO sports years ago. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6647.400000000001s)]
*  That's the biggest miss. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6649.400000000001s)]
*  Ari Emanuel set up a meeting for Dana White and the UFC with HBO sports when [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6650.92s)]
*  HBO boxing was still booming and for whatever reason, I think it was ultimately [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6655.92s)]
*  the UFC's decision not to go there. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6660.799999999999s)]
*  UFC it was HBO wanted to produce the events. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6663.04s)]
*  Dana wanted to make sure he controlled his own production. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6667.24s)]
*  The deal didn't make. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6670.04s)]
*  And you've seen what the UFC has gone on to do. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6671.44s)]
*  HBO sports doesn't exist anymore. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6674.5199999999995s)]
*  So at one point, as you know, they had Wimbledon years ago, and I think other [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6677.2s)]
*  tennis tournaments, then the Kings of boxing, hard knocks, documentaries. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6681.04s)]
*  They had a foothold of something. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6685.4400000000005s)]
*  Correct. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6687.12s)]
*  And then I think they sort of got comfortable. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6687.56s)]
*  And by the way, if you ask the folks at the NFL, some of the folks at the NFL [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6689.96s)]
*  right now, what's your biggest concern? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6693.4800000000005s)]
*  They'll quietly tell you to make sure that we never think like major league [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6695.96s)]
*  baseball thought in the seventies, which is, Hey, we're the number one sport. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6699.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6702.72s)]
*  So lucky us. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6702.96s)]
*  It's sort of, what do we keep needing? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6705.08s)]
*  What do we have to do to make sure that we stay number one? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6707.240000000001s)]
*  And like you said, Hey, there's an 18th game coming and Hey, let's take the [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6710.92s)]
*  combine out of Indianapolis and Hey, in Philly for the first time, six, seven, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6714.360000000001s)]
*  eight years ago, whatever it was, let's take the draft on the road and let's [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6718.56s)]
*  monetize that everything they do is constantly evolving that product. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6722.0s)]
*  I think it's the same thing with the UFC and their business model. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6726.96s)]
*  I hope that WW is perceived in the same light. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6730.320000000001s)]
*  Sometimes if we get it wrong with Triple H and I talk or Lee fitting or [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6733.599999999999s)]
*  Chris Ligento other senior executives at WW it'll start with, Hey, I [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6737.72s)]
*  think we fucked this thing up. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6741.72s)]
*  It'll be one of us saying that. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6743.36s)]
*  And then, okay, how do we fix it moving forward? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6745.12s)]
*  And the most important thing is to identify the problem and realize you have [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6747.72s)]
*  a problem if you're trying to avoid it, or you're trying to say it's someone else's [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6750.84s)]
*  problem, by the way, much like the last presidential election and you and I are [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6754.28s)]
*  not overtly political, but what I saw was one person saying, I'm going to take [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6758.5199999999995s)]
*  care of you, I'm going to look out for you. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6764.32s)]
*  And another party saying, don't vote for this guy. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6766.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, right. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6769.08s)]
*  And with no message at all. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6769.48s)]
*  I've just never seen that work. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6770.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6772.4s)]
*  I don't, I don't believe vote for us. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6772.799999999999s)]
*  Cause you can't vote for him. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6774.679999999999s)]
*  Absurd. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6776.44s)]
*  Like, how, how do you make that decision? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6777.16s)]
*  You and running the ringer, when you bring talent over here, it's let me [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6780.4s)]
*  tell you what we can do together. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6783.799999999999s)]
*  It's the same thing at WWE. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6785.639999999999s)]
*  It's not, don't go with the other guys that maybe it works on one or two deals, [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6787.32s)]
*  but it doesn't work long-term. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6791.92s)]
*  You got to figure out that problem is and change the messaging. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6793.44s)]
*  What is the ESPN five years from now? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6796.28s)]
*  Look, I think it's still continues to exist in a meaningful way. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6799.48s)]
*  The sub loss has obviously hit them hard, but I think they've actually made some [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6803.28s)]
*  good moves with a lower subscription audience. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6807.48s)]
*  So as you said, they fixed their NFL talent issue. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6812.639999999999s)]
*  They fixed their NFL relationship. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6816.959999999999s)]
*  At least that's my perception. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6819.16s)]
*  I think I would agree with that. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6820.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6822.28s)]
*  And look, they went in on retaining their NBA rights. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6822.879999999999s)]
*  The finals being quite meaningful to them. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6827.0s)]
*  They don't have their first Superbowl. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6829.4s)]
*  If I might have a college football, a lot of college football, right? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6830.799999999999s)]
*  They went all in on the sec. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6833.5599999999995s)]
*  They went all in on the playoff in the championship. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6835.12s)]
*  They went all in on certain talent as you just articulated. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6838.2s)]
*  And Hey, it's sort of reflective of the U S economy, if you will, relatively [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6841.799999999999s)]
*  speaking, the middle-class there got squeezed. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6846.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6849.2s)]
*  The people making a lot of money made more money and Hey, if you want to make, [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6849.44s)]
*  you know, entry level money, there'll be a spot for you again, relatively [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6853.32s)]
*  speaking, reflective of the U S economy. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6856.48s)]
*  It's a weird one. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6859.679999999999s)]
*  Cause I think that thing that's changed from maybe 15 years ago was the sense of [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6860.48s)]
*  like, we also want to do great stuff. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6866.599999999999s)]
*  Like there was a bar for. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6869.799999999999s)]
*  We at least a couple of times a year want to be looked at as, as a place that [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6871.32s)]
*  did an awesome thing or like, you know, inspired somebody in some way or did [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6876.0s)]
*  some piece of content that could really impact people. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6880.88s)]
*  And I don't know if they still feel that way. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6885.12s)]
*  Look, I think as soon as budget shrinks, those tend to be the first things to go. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6887.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6892.12s)]
*  Well, I think they've just kind of, we're, we're showing games. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6892.5599999999995s)]
*  We got games and highlights and that's kind of the way we're doing it. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6896.96s)]
*  And that's kind of what we are for the most part. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6900.5199999999995s)]
*  And, you know, they'll still do some other stuff, but maybe, maybe when to have [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6902.96s)]
*  ambition like that, when you have a company in the size of that, I think, um, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6907.28s)]
*  maybe it's too hard to juggle everything. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6911.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6913.32s)]
*  It could be that, or it could simply be, you know, Hey, we had a hundred million [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6913.5199999999995s)]
*  subs at one point, what does it now 54 or 55? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6917.28s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6920.719999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6921.8s)]
*  But as soon as the bundle went away and people actually, you know, had a choice [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6922.88s)]
*  in terms of what they could subscribe to, I don't think it's a reflection on [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6927.04s)]
*  ESPN. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6930.08s)]
*  I think it's, it was bundled in and people sort of had to have it. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6930.72s)]
*  And when they didn't have to have it, the people who still wanted it kept it. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6934.6s)]
*  So if you're dealing with smaller numbers, those then tend to be the things that go [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6938.12s)]
*  first. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6941.4s)]
*  If you have, you know, a surplus year, you got to be careful because next year may [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6942.36s)]
*  not be as good for this WrestleMania coming up, coming off of the success of [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6947.08s)]
*  WrestleMania Philly, uh, 2024. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6951.92s)]
*  We have WWE world, a partnership with fanatics. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6954.6s)]
*  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, all day event, the two night [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6958.44s)]
*  WrestleMania, which we talked about already. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6963.44s)]
*  We have smack down on Friday. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6965.599999999999s)]
*  We have raw on Monday. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6967.2s)]
*  We have the hall of fame standalone show Friday night after smack down. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6968.5599999999995s)]
*  We have the undertaker one dead man show is sort of one man show, if you will. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6972.759999999999s)]
*  Right after, um, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6977.679999999999s)]
*  and then we have Tony Hinchcliffe roast of WrestleMania after WrestleMania Sunday. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6981.2s)]
*  And then by the way, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, we also have an [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6985.24s)]
*  after party with our partners, medium rare at the fountain blue. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6988.599999999999s)]
*  You'll see WWE stars there. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6992.639999999999s)]
*  You'll see other celebrities there. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6994.16s)]
*  It's all day, all night. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6995.88s)]
*  That's coming off of the success. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6997.639999999999s)]
*  We think all of these will be successful. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=6999.24s)]
*  All indicators are there going to be hopefully phenomenally successful. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7001.44s)]
*  And then next year we got to go build something bigger. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7005.4s)]
*  That's just the way it is. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7007.639999999999s)]
*  So you think for ESPN, it's the grind of, you know, where Amazon and Netflix can [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7009.360000000001s)]
*  just parachute in and out of stuff that they want. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7016.0s)]
*  Look at ESPN has a 365 day responsibility still at this point to have stuff. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7018.64s)]
*  And I think they have way more competitors than they used to. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7025.320000000001s)]
*  I remember when FSC one got theirs, you know, 2013 and it was like, here comes [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7028.0s)]
*  that first one and ESPN's attitude was like, how dare you, we're going to. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7032.4800000000005s)]
*  And I felt the same way. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7037.04s)]
*  I was like, we're going to crush these guys come get us. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7038.24s)]
*  And now there's, you know, seven, eight different people with real money coming [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7040.2s)]
*  at you and it's, it's really hard to stay on top. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7045.12s)]
*  Look, I remember the FS one thing. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7047.5199999999995s)]
*  ESPN was so dominant. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7049.88s)]
*  Well, you remember the FS one thing, cause you made a lot of money. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7052.08s)]
*  Just parlaying the two networks for a lot of people. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7055.4s)]
*  You remember that as the hay day. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7059.12s)]
*  Those are the clients. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7060.679999999999s)]
*  We're like, Nick Khan, the greatest year in Nick Khan's life. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7061.4s)]
*  So, you're like at a school auction, getting the two drunk parents, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7064.32s)]
*  do I have to hear 20 K for the trip to Mexico? [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7069.24s)]
*  22. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7072.52s)]
*  Listen, I was just right place, right time. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7074.24s)]
*  What can I say? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7076.12s)]
*  But ESPN was so dominant that it was okay. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7077.24s)]
*  We're going to keep our 11 o'clock sports center and we're going to bring back [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7080.32s)]
*  Keith Olbermann to put them on ESPN too, to make sure just in case you're thinking [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7083.92s)]
*  of, Hey, I don't want to watch sports center. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7088.8s)]
*  We have something else to offer for you. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7090.52s)]
*  And oh yeah, we got grand land programming and what was the name of your, [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7092.4s)]
*  your unsanctioned NBA show, the great basketball show basketball show. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7096.0s)]
*  We did 10. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7101.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7101.76s)]
*  So it was like even unsanctioned, we're going to have, you know, high end content [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7102.16s)]
*  here and again, that I would say the first 50, 30 for thirties, if you will, like [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7105.88s)]
*  amazing, shockingly, like just the quality off the charts and then over time, like [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7112.72s)]
*  there are only so many, some stinkers to be fair. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7119.36s)]
*  Early on. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7121.759999999999s)]
*  I'm so happy. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7124.4s)]
*  Everyone remembers them all. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7125.24s)]
*  Finally. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7126.2s)]
*  Maybe the, maybe the Colts one wasn't as good as, no, I wasn't going to name names. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7128.0s)]
*  I thought you, I'm just saying, I thought you winked at me and said, let's name [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7133.32s)]
*  people. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7135.92s)]
*  It's like anything else as the years pass, people remember the best 10 or 12 and [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7136.44s)]
*  think, how about when you have to spike the Marion Jones one? [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7140.48s)]
*  No one talks about that. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7143.4s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7144.799999999999s)]
*  Um, yeah, I don't know. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7145.88s)]
*  Well, so the, the, uh, WB, all that stuff, any predictions, any predictions for [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7147.6s)]
*  anything? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7153.56s)]
*  What do you mean the WB? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7154.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7154.96s)]
*  You always have the, the, uh, Warner Brothers, like everything that they're [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7155.120000000001s)]
*  trying to like work around the fringes now with, uh, they didn't get MBA, but [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7159.160000000001s)]
*  now they're, I can't tell. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7163.84s)]
*  There was a big piece about them this week. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7165.8s)]
*  Yes, I read it. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7167.64s)]
*  Um, which was a weird, it was one of those. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7168.280000000001s)]
*  I have a lot of information going in all these different directions and the [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7172.200000000001s)]
*  reader is just going to have to figure out what to make of this. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7175.36s)]
*  Um, but the, the basic premise was Warner Brothers stuck between these two worlds, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7178.96s)]
*  this world that used to exist in this world that's about to happen, kind of [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7183.719999999999s)]
*  feeling like that maybe is a strategy. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7187.04s)]
*  That that's pretty interesting. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7189.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7190.5199999999995s)]
*  I think, I think, I think like any company, you know, maybe they made a couple of [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7191.16s)]
*  mistakes, you know, here and there. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7196.48s)]
*  Um, but I think they now see that. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7198.639999999999s)]
*  And if they can figure out, okay, what's the programming to build, bring in post [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7201.4800000000005s)]
*  NBA that it's tough, right? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7206.04s)]
*  When there's so many mouths to feed TNT, TBS, max HBO, Oh, true TV. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7208.24s)]
*  Oh, this, so that like, it's a lot. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7214.16s)]
*  And those are still generating revenue. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7216.56s)]
*  So you'd think, which one is Dr. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7218.400000000001s)]

*  Dr. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7221.6s)]
*  Pimple popper. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7222.0s)]
*  I don't remember which one. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7222.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7224.52s)]

*  So I see it on the grid, you know, you still have direct TV. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7226.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7230.320000000001s)]
*  Who do you call when something goes wrong? [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7231.0s)]
*  It's brutal. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7232.76s)]
*  Do they even have people working? [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7233.24s)]
*  Listen, it's brutal. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7234.68s)]
*  I tried to order the Terrence Crawford, Arrowspence boxing match off of direct TV. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7236.320000000001s)]

*  I called someone, spoke to someone overseas. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7244.12s)]
*  I said, what are you talking about? [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7246.08s)]
*  Pay-per-view. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7247.0s)]
*  What is their limit? [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7247.4800000000005s)]
*  I just want to spend money. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7248.400000000001s)]

*  Then how is there a limit and what am I ordering on pay-per-view that [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7252.280000000001s)]
*  would put me past that limit? [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7255.360000000001s)]

*  It's a mess, but I still have it. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7259.76s)]
*  That's YouTube TV and Apple TV. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7262.280000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7269.68s)]
*  So they used to come in, they would put a dish on top of our house. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7269.92s)]
*  They would give us a receiver. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7273.56s)]
*  If you cancel direct TV, you would have to mail the receiver back or [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7274.76s)]
*  it would cost you $500. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7278.4800000000005s)]
*  Nobody would answer if there was an issue. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7280.52s)]
*  I can't wait to. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7283.280000000001s)]
*  Bill, how about this part of it? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7284.080000000001s)]
*  That's a documentary. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7285.320000000001s)]
*  So we connected on me coming on your podcast. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7286.360000000001s)]
*  What if you said to me, um, show up somewhere between 8 a.m. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7289.76s)]
*  and noon and, uh, you know, hopefully I'll be there, which is what the [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7293.64s)]
*  cable companies and direct TV said. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7298.120000000001s)]
*  They give you this window at noon. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7300.240000000001s)]
*  How about like eight to three? [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7302.040000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7303.320000000001s)]
*  And at 11 59, you'd call and be like, Hey, my guy hasn't shown up yet. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7303.4400000000005s)]
*  Like what's going on? [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7306.92s)]
*  Oh, we're so sorry. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7307.84s)]
*  We have to reschedule for 10 days. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7308.92s)]
*  You wouldn't allow your doctor to do that. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7310.96s)]
*  You wouldn't allow your accountant to do that. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7312.76s)]
*  Can I just put you on hold for one second, sir? [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7314.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, please don't. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7316.240000000001s)]
*  No, please. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7317.240000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7318.200000000001s)]
*  Don't put me on hold. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7318.44s)]
*  How about when they'd hang up on you after a while and then you're just [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7319.639999999999s)]
*  started, started the process over. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7322.32s)]
*  The process over one of the happiest days of my life was, was moving to [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7323.879999999999s)]
*  streamer stuff full time and not having direct TV. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7327.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7330.16s)]
*  By the way, again, like the in demand dish direct vig that we were talking [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7330.24s)]
*  about the football too much hubris, too much arrogance with their product. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7334.16s)]
*  Instead of football, they felt like they could do anything they wanted. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7339.5199999999995s)]
*  Correct. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7341.919999999999s)]
*  Instead of, by the way, as you know, it was a big brag in like 2000, 2001. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7342.48s)]
*  If you had direct TV, you were like, yeah, you were the guy. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7347.12s)]
*  It was like one of the first things I ever splurged on. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7351.04s)]
*  Correct. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7352.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7353.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't have cable. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7353.88s)]
*  I got satellite. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7355.04s)]
*  I can get all the football games and then I get all the basketball games. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7356.4s)]
*  And they took full advantage of the consumer as did the cable companies. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7360.56s)]
*  The traditional cable companies will be there between eight and noon. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7364.12s)]
*  We'll be there between noon and five. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7367.0s)]
*  Like it was a joke. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7368.4800000000005s)]
*  The whole thing was a joke. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7370.4800000000005s)]
*  And then, Hey, someone came along with a better product and, you [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7371.6s)]
*  know, ate part of their lunch. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7374.72s)]
*  Who buys, who becomes the next, uh, Iger successor, who takes over? [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7376.16s)]
*  Who's your money on? [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7381.84s)]
*  I would say 60% chance insider, 40% chance outsider. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7383.64s)]
*  So I'm a little more interesting because they have the fork. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7387.36s)]
*  It's really three candidates coming from inside. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7389.84s)]
*  Matt Bellamy wrote a really good piece for puck. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7393.08s)]
*  Our guy, Matt, about, uh, also very rich like you now, Matt. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7395.64s)]
*  Oh, he's loaded. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7399.64s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7400.64s)]
*  He's on TV shows now. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7402.0s)]
*  He's doing great. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7403.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7403.92s)]
*  He's a scripted actor now. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7404.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7405.32s)]
*  He's on the studio, but he had a whole piece about, could Disney go after [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7405.5599999999995s)]
*  Sarandos, which, Hey, I was really jealous of great idea. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7409.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know how I just so mad that I didn't come up with that. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7413.599999999999s)]
*  Um, B really interesting idea. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7417.5199999999995s)]
*  Like if you're going to do an outsider, why not do like a Maverick outsider? [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7421.799999999999s)]
*  And one of the things I was wondering was like, would Iger even want that? [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7424.96s)]
*  Would you want your successor to be somebody who would actually be a little [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7429.719999999999s)]
*  more cutting edge, maybe than you are. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7432.8s)]
*  And maybe somebody that could reinvent some things and modernize your company [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7435.360000000001s)]
*  in some different ways. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7439.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7440.88s)]
*  I thought that was fascinating. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7441.280000000001s)]
*  And then if you're Sarandos, would you want to do that? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7443.12s)]
*  Are you already in the Disney of now? [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7446.04s)]
*  Do you even need to leave Netflix? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7448.56s)]
*  Well, think about his career arc. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7449.88s)]
*  You remember when they split, what was it? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7452.08s)]
*  Netflix and Quickster? [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7453.72s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7455.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7455.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7455.88s)]
*  So I almost ended his career. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7456.2s)]
*  Almost ended his career, but then quickly they realized, like we were talking [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7457.64s)]
*  about, no, we've made a mistake here. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7461.84s)]
*  We better change this and we better shut that down and we better hyper [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7463.64s)]
*  focus on the fact that people aren't going to be really renting DVDs for [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7467.12s)]
*  that much longer and they nailed it. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7471.32s)]
*  And then early on, okay, let's put on the, uh, Kevin Spacey show and [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7474.12s)]
*  orange is a new black, let's cater towards, you know, the critics, if you will. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7478.56s)]
*  Sarandos came out and said, we need to be HBO before HBO becomes us, which [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7483.84s)]
*  he corrected six, nine months ago in the New York Times Q and a recent [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7488.12s)]
*  what I should have said was we need to become HBO, CBS, the BBC, and all of [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7491.8s)]
*  these other things before they all become us and to his credit and Netflix's [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7497.16s)]
*  credit, they did do that, right? [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7501.4800000000005s)]
*  There's something for everybody there globally, not just domestically. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7503.72s)]
*  So when you turn it on, you're like another Menendez brothers [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7508.64s)]
*  documentary, like, yeah, people watch it. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7510.96s)]
*  They also realize like, I have always thought a lot of people lie [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7513.320000000001s)]
*  about their taste in things. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7517.36s)]
*  The, even if it's anonymous polling, people lie. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7519.72s)]
*  I think to me that the first sign I saw, you remember like in the [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7523.72s)]
*  late nineties, early two thousands, the radio ratings were done off, writing [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7526.52s)]
*  it down in a notebook, what you listen to. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7531.04s)]
*  So you'd see classical music on FM radio, smart talk on FM radio. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7533.44s)]
*  And as soon as the rating metric shifted to the PPM, the portable people [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7538.8s)]
*  meters, and they could actually tell what people were listening to. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7543.12s)]
*  No one was listening to classical music. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7546.599999999999s)]
*  No one was listening to smart talk. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7548.48s)]
*  But when you're put on the spot of like, Hey Bill, do you like smart talk? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7550.36s)]
*  What are you supposed to say? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7553.679999999999s)]
*  No, I like dumb talk. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7554.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7555.759999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7556.4s)]
*  Of course I like smart. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7556.719999999999s)]
*  Do you like classical music? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7557.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7558.719999999999s)]
*  I love classical music. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7558.799999999999s)]
*  Netflix realizes like people like all kinds of programming. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7560.0s)]
*  I think Bravo realized it years ago also with the housewives. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7564.5199999999995s)]
*  MTV realized that. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7567.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7568.32s)]
*  A couple of ones got it. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7568.5599999999995s)]
*  By the way, think about Jersey shorts first season. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7570.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7572.32s)]
*  Like people not in LA LA, you could always say what you're watching. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7572.759999999999s)]
*  There's no such thing to me as a guilty pleasure. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7576.4s)]
*  If you like something like it, but in other parts of the country where that [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7578.6s)]
*  kind of program was looked down upon, people would be like, Oh yeah, I watched [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7582.12s)]
*  Jersey Shore, I just don't admit it. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7585.12s)]
*  And I'll lay you admit it. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7586.84s)]
*  It was great TV. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7587.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7592.48s)]
*  Algorithms are a window into your soul. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7592.64s)]
*  It's like, do you like true crime documentaries where somebody got kidnapped [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7594.72s)]
*  and they couldn't find the killer for three episodes? [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7598.48s)]
*  I do. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7600.6s)]

*  I'm in. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7608.68s)]
*  How about Netflix did another OJ documentary? [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7609.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7611.68s)]

*  They got to come back. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7616.76s)]
*  Bundy is a sitcom. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7617.400000000001s)]
*  By the way, how about the Dahmer scripted series? [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7619.36s)]
*  Yeah, we're back. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7621.36s)]
*  Tough to watch on an airplane. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7622.68s)]
*  Tough to watch Dahmer on an airplane. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7625.2s)]
*  The hooking up with the mannequin thing. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7627.52s)]
*  I think I'm good with Dahmer for a while. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7630.12s)]
*  Manson, I was like, I gave it a, you know, I like Manson stuff. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7632.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7636.56s)]
*  Um, but it was one of those. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7636.68s)]
*  It was like, all right. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7638.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know if how much I learned from that, but yeah, they're rerunning the hits now. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7639.12s)]
*  Did you like the once upon a time in Hollywood Manson storyline? [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7643.56s)]
*  And I love that movie. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7647.2s)]
*  So yeah, yeah. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7648.04s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7649.76s)]
*  I feel like people like didn't love it the way I thought they should have loved it. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7649.92s)]
*  What happened? [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7653.240000000001s)]
*  I was just talking with Fennessey and Chris about this. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7653.6s)]
*  COVID happened. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7656.04s)]
*  It came out. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7658.16s)]
*  It had its whole run through 2019. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7659.76s)]
*  We, we were at Sundance. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7662.16s)]
*  We did a live, uh, we did a live rewatchables of that movie. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7664.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe beginning of February. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7670.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7671.36s)]
*  And then it was about to have this whole run with the Oscars and, and, um, all the [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7672.2s)]
*  way through and it just would have moved it. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7678.04s)]
*  And then COVID happened and COVID messed everything up. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7680.4s)]
*  That really did. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7683.8s)]
*  Like convert, just people didn't have the same conversations about anything. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7684.44s)]
*  So I always felt like that was weird because it's, it has been five [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7689.599999999999s)]
*  plus years since that movie came out. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7692.2s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7694.08s)]
*  Now they're making a sequel. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7694.5599999999995s)]
*  I just read that the other day. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7696.12s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7699.2s)]
*  Tarantino written movie. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7699.48s)]
*  When was the last time he wrote a movie that he didn't direct? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7702.679999999999s)]
*  True romance or something after that? [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7705.5599999999995s)]
*  There's probably something since then. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7707.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7709.28s)]
*  It's pretty rare. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7709.5599999999995s)]
*  I just watched true romance with our 13 year old daughter for the first time. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7711.08s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7715.120000000001s)]
*  Skipped a couple. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7715.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7716.76s)]
*  That's when you have to really know the movie and fast forward. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7717.0s)]
*  Early Gary Oldman stuff. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7720.6s)]
*  You got to skip a little bit, but after that, even the Christopher Walken, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7721.76s)]
*  Dennis Hopper scene, you can watch it. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7725.72s)]

*  Bathroom bra with Tony Soprano and Patricia Arquette is pretty brutal. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7728.96s)]
*  Pretty brutal. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7732.6s)]
*  It's a great movie though. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7733.240000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7734.0s)]

*  What's going to happen in Cena Cody? [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7738.76s)]
*  Where does that go? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7742.0s)]
*  You think that's the number one? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7742.68s)]
*  I haven't watched wrestling all year, but this is the one thing I should care about. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7744.280000000001s)]
*  Storyline. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7748.56s)]
*  I think it's very close with Roman punk and Seth because with Roman punk and Seth [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7749.04s)]
*  as an argument has to be made as to why each person should win. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7754.04s)]
*  And, you know, do you see Roman getting pinned when he got pinned last year by Cody? [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7758.280000000001s)]
*  You know, how's that going to turn out? [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7763.16s)]
*  Roman's still at his peak. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7765.04s)]
*  He's not on the back nine, not even close to it from our point of view. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7766.36s)]
*  How old is he now? [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7771.36s)]
*  What happens at Roman? [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7772.08s)]
*  I think it's 36. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7773.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7775.8s)]

*  No question. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7781.8s)]
*  He takes phenomenal care of himself. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7782.4s)]
*  It's sort of like the Floyd Mayweather thing. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7784.32s)]
*  Floyd never got fat, never drank, you know, always kept himself ready to go, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7786.639999999999s)]
*  which I always respected Roman Cody, these guys who keep themselves in that [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7791.84s)]
*  top sort of physical shape. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7795.84s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7798.72s)]
*  But the baseball people, and I'm not a huge baseball guy would tell me, Hey, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7799.68s)]
*  the stats show you past the age of 39. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7803.400000000001s)]

*  You can't even. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7820.2s)]
*  By the way, we got lucky with this Golden State loss the other day. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7821.6s)]
*  So WWE WrestleMania does not go up against Lakers Golden State this Saturday. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7824.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7829.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7834.8s)]

*  It's going to be a win. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7835.96s)]
*  The NBA finals this year. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7836.88s)]
*  I sure hope the Celtics. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7839.84s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7841.120000000001s)]

*  Nobody believes in us building with them. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7843.0s)]
*  Uh, the Clippers are excellent. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7845.360000000001s)]
*  Cleveland's really good. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7847.8s)]
*  There's like five teams that could take it this year. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7848.76s)]
*  It's unusual. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7850.8s)]
*  Is Celtics Lakers still the best, the highest rated, [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7851.68s)]
*  of all time for the league. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7856.96s)]
*  I was looking at the, although Nick's Lakers would be bigger. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7858.96s)]
*  It's not going to happen this year, but I think if you had New York, LA, the [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7862.8s)]
*  Knicks not having one since 73 and then generations of Knicks fans, that's [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7867.0s)]
*  probably bigger Lakers make it to the championship. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7871.120000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7873.68s)]

*  And then, you know, you can't count out Denver just cause they have [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7897.5599999999995s)]
*  Yocage, but I can't see them winning three rounds in a row, but it says [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7900.08s)]
*  they're in a spot a little bit like you guys where they just have a [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7903.48s)]
*  shitload of talent right now. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40gjic-VvU&t=7906.5199999999995s)]
