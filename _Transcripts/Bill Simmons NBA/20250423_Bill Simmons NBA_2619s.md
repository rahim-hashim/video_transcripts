# How Kawhi Leonard Became 2025’s Unlikeliest Superstar with Zach Lowe | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08)
*  You and I have known each other for basically Kawhi's entire career. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=0.0s)]
*  I think we first met each other, at least like on email or wherever in 2011, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  which is here, he was drafted. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=8.94s)]
*  I thought one of the best pieces you ever wrote for Grantland was the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=10.68s)]
*  Kawhi George Hill trade piece, which was, I think, um, I just remember when you [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  wrote it, I was like, this is, I feel like this is where basketball writing is heading. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=18.42s)]
*  Like it's not just like, who, you know, this is like some sort of, it was sourced. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=24.04s)]
*  Why did they do this? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=30.0s)]
*  Where's this going? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=31.12s)]
*  It was a sliding doors moment. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=31.92s)]
*  I still can't believe they like multiple front office people talked to me on the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=34.16s)]
*  record for that piece about like, what was going on during the draft? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=37.62s)]
*  What were they thinking? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=40.42s)]
*  I'm like, well, maybe that's why maybe it was like a newish piece and they were [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=41.28s)]
*  like, oh, this will be fun. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=45.1s)]
*  Let's do this interview and reveal like what was going on for this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  Happen anymore, right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=51.0s)]
*  Anyone's doing that again. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=51.64s)]
*  For some reason in the early 2010s, people were like, here's some information. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=52.96s)]
*  Take it wherever. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Worked out well for me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  So then Kawhi, he has a couple of different arts. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  There's never been a career like this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=65.72s)]
*  And I said to you, just come on my podcast. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=68.4s)]
*  We're not going to do an hour and a half. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=70.68s)]
*  Let's talk about Kawhi Leonard because I can't remember really anything like this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  I think it's the second biggest what if career of all time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=76.56s)]
*  I'm going to start there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=79.84s)]
*  I think Bill Walton is still number one. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=80.76s)]
*  I think Kawhi's second where it's been a great career. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=83.84s)]
*  He's making the hall of fame anyway. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=87.44s)]
*  He was NBA top 75, but there's this extra gear and it came down to bad luck and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=88.6s)]
*  injuries, which happens so much in the NBA, but you see stuff like last night [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=95.0s)]
*  and you go back and he looked through some of the history and you're like, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=99.36s)]
*  could this guy have been like one of the 15 best players of all time? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=102.2s)]
*  Oh, there's, there's no, did he make top 75? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=106.24s)]
*  I think he did. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=109.36s)]
*  He did. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=109.68s)]
*  So there's no question. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=110.32s)]
*  He would be one of the top three. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=111.16s)]
*  He might already be one of the top 50 players of all time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=112.2s)]
*  He's a two time finals MVP. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=114.28s)]
*  He's kind of like the 15. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=116.04s)]
*  Oh, I'm talking like, oh, I'm talking high levels. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=118.84s)]
*  So now you're talking like he's in the Durant, Berkeley, Yanis, maybe heading [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=123.84s)]
*  toward where that Shaq Moses, a Keem level, like how high could it have gone? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=129.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=133.56s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=135.0s)]
*  Now health is a huge part of this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=137.52s)]
*  Durability is a huge part of this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=139.0s)]
*  And the, and the best guys ever have always managed to stay on the court has [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=140.44s)]
*  been one of the things and he wasn't able to do that, which is why it's a what if. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=144.44s)]
*  But his best was up there with everybody from this century. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=148.4s)]
*  No question. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=154.2s)]
*  Two time finals, MVP, defensive player of the year, um, 50, 40, 85 in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=154.92s)]
*  playoffs, uh, and we'll talk, we, I have, I did a little dig. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=161.16s)]
*  I got, I did some basketball reference sorting. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=165.52s)]
*  I got some good stuff. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=167.48s)]
*  Um, all time two way wing most valuable position in the league. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=168.64s)]
*  Uh, has multiple iconic playoff series, playoff moments, and one of the most [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=174.52s)]
*  iconic playoff shots in the history of basketball, the four bouncer, um, in, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=180.76s)]
*  in Toronto against the Sixers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=187.16s)]
*  Uh, and like, again, you never know, like with these guys, like all the time he's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=189.2s)]
*  missed, if he had played all that time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=195.84s)]
*  What if he, it's, if he had played twice as many minutes or 1.5 times as [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=199.0s)]
*  many minutes, how does he look right now? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=204.2s)]
*  Cause right now he looks incredible and fresh and all that stuff. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=205.48s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, look, he hasn't finished the season healthy since 2020, since the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=209.6s)]
*  bubble, he has not finished his team season available to play since the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  Clippers flamed out in the bubble and knock on wood, we're only two games into [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  this and he's playing a ton of minutes and he played a ton of minutes at the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  end of the season. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  If he plays like this, like, I think we just get, did you just give up on this? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Like, I just kind of get like when they lost Paul George in free agency, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  I was just kind of like, he's going to miss half the season. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be all dependent. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=237.16s)]
*  I just didn't see the Clippers ever reaching this level again in this iteration [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  of them in part because I just kind of gave up on this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=242.88s)]
*  It just seemed like a pipe dream that we'd ever see this level Kawhi in the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=246.56s)]
*  playoffs every game. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=250.28s)]
*  And I really, you know how much I love Kawhi. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=251.44s)]
*  I voted him MVP in the year Russ won the MVP when it was a super controversial [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  vote, I think I was one of eight guys to vote for him. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=258.76s)]
*  I thought he was the best player in the league that year. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=260.52s)]
*  And I just hope we get to see this because what he did, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=263.04s)]
*  what he's doing and just eviscerating every defender that they threw at him [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=266.12s)]
*  last night, 15 of 19 for 39 points is ridiculous. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=270.84s)]
*  And the last basket of the game or yeah, it was to put them up by three. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=273.68s)]
*  Hard, hard shots too. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=278.16s)]
*  And a steal right after that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=280.4s)]
*  Contested shots. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=281.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=282.08s)]
*  He just, what we saw last night in game too, which is why I want to do this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=282.64s)]
*  segment, cause I don't feel like it's possible to overreact to it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=287.2s)]
*  What he did last night was as good as I think I've ever seen him play. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=290.64s)]
*  And this is a guy who's had some amazing, amazing moments, but yeah, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=294.52s)]
*  I mean, if you go through it, there's so many what ifs with him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=298.96s)]
*  Where you start with like, what if, what if the 2017 playoffs when he gets hurt? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=304.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=309.0s)]
*  I don't think they would have beaten Golden State. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=309.76s)]
*  I think that's one of the three or four best teams of our lifetime, but it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  would have been a good series. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  And so we saw enough in the two and a half quarters of that game to be like, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=318.8s)]
*  okay, like he's going to give them a puncher's chance in all of these games. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=323.12s)]
*  Like they'll probably lose four, two or four one, but this is going to, this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=326.48s)]
*  isn't going to be like a walkover, like everything else they had that year. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=329.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=332.12s)]
*  He's going to be thrown punches. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=332.32s)]
*  What if he signs off on the 2018 Boston trade is a really good what if, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=334.6s)]
*  Boston was trying to come after him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=339.76s)]
*  Take me, take me. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=341.68s)]
*  That's, that's your, that's your world. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=342.68s)]
*  Well, that at least would have been Jaylen Brown and some other stuff and, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=344.36s)]
*  you know, I think Boston was really hesitant to actually consider talking about [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=348.12s)]
*  it because he was making it so clear. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=353.32s)]
*  This is a one year thing. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=355.04s)]
*  And I'm going to LA and wink, wink. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=356.96s)]
*  I'm, I'm going to a different city after with Toronto didn't care. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=359.6s)]
*  There's the what if Kauai just resigns with Toronto in 2019 because they had a [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=364.0s)]
*  pretty good nucleus, you know, and you think like the league was a little bit [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=368.0s)]
*  weird there in 20 and 21, 22, could they have gotten back to something games [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=371.8s)]
*  the next year, they were one of the best stories. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=375.48s)]
*  I think did Nick nurse when coach of the year that year, I think after, yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=377.0s)]
*  Um, there's the what if Kauai signs with LeBron and the Lakers in 2019, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=381.32s)]
*  which is what we thought was going to happen. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=386.28s)]
*  And I don't even know, can they get Anthony Davis at that point? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  Probably, I don't know if they could, maybe they could have fit all these. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=391.2s)]
*  I can't remember the details of it, but maybe if you get Kauai, you don't need [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=393.76s)]
*  Anthony Davis and you're using those picks for other things, you're building [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=397.76s)]
*  around those two guys, those two guys make sense together. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=400.84s)]
*  What if, what if he starts getting hurt within a couple of months after that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=403.8s)]
*  trade and now LeBron has no running mate and that's ridiculous to even suggest [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=407.52s)]
*  this bill, nothing like that ever falls into the Lakers laps. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't happen. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=415.24s)]
*  They don't just get stars. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=416.24s)]
*  They go to their team like shock. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=417.48s)]
*  It doesn't happen. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=419.48s)]
*  What if COVID doesn't happen is a really good what if for really a bunch of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=421.2s)]
*  different people in 2020, but especially when you think about where the league [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=424.84s)]
*  was at that moment, Milwaukee was kicking everybody's ass, the Lakers and Clippers [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=428.08s)]
*  were the two best teams in the West. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=432.68s)]
*  And it felt like there were three teams and then everyone else. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=434.2s)]
*  And we were headed toward this LA versus LA then the COVID, the bubble, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=437.04s)]
*  things get weird, whatever. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=441.16s)]
*  And then, you know, the last one is what if he stays healthy in 2021 when he gets [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=442.32s)]
*  hurt and then Paul George elevates, but I forgot this, he played 11 playoff [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=446.76s)]
*  games that year in 2011 and he averaged 30 a game in the playoff games. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=451.6s)]
*  Seven against Dallas and four against Utah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=455.64s)]
*  And then kind of left. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  I went to the game where he kind of left near the end of the game. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  It's like, Oh, that's not great. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=464.2s)]
*  Um, well, can we, can we, can we just stop for a second? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=466.08s)]
*  Like we shouldn't, we shouldn't slow down on it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=469.32s)]
*  We should, we should slow down at a couple of things. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=471.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=473.92s)]
*  Um, the first one is the bubble and COVID because I picked the Clippers to win [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=474.2s)]
*  the championship that year and we learned pretty quickly even during the bubble. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=479.68s)]
*  And then after that, no team wanted to be there less than the Clippers and they [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=484.12s)]
*  just completely, I don't know that I've ever seen a team let go of the rope like [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=488.96s)]
*  that, uh, like David against Denver. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=492.79999999999995s)]
*  Like they wanted to leave over trying to try to win the title. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=494.88s)]
*  Seemed to be a feeling that was pretty pervasive. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=498.4s)]
*  And 2021 he gets hurt against Utah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=501.47999999999996s)]
*  Um, the series is two, two when he gets hurt and they end up winning the series. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  The end, essentially the end of the jazz of the Mitchell go bear, you know, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=507.4s)]
*  it or they had one more year after that, but everyone knew it was kind of over. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=511.4s)]
*  Um, we just like, I, I, that 45 point game six to save the Clippers season. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=514.68s)]
*  And remember that series against Dallas, they get rolled the first two games in LA. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=523.32s)]
*  They're down like a million points in game three in Dallas. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=527.04s)]
*  And it just feels like it's over. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=529.6s)]
*  They saved the season. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=531.6s)]
*  They're still down three, two in game six. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=532.76s)]
*  And he plays one of the best games I've ever seen anyone play 18 of 25, 13 of 16 [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=536.52s)]
*  at the line, 45 points and the usual defense and single-handedly wins the game [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=542.04s)]
*  and saves their season. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=546.92s)]
*  Then he follows it up with like a whole hum, 28, 10 and nine in game seven. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=547.7199999999999s)]
*  Just that's one of the best games that's up there with any game I've ever seen [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  anybody play. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=555.4s)]
*  I just wanted to say that it's all down and say that game. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, and then you think from a Quipper standpoint, the most tortured NBA [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=559.56s)]
*  franchise we have in 21 is just wide open. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  You look back at that season and it's like bucks team that I'm not even sure [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  was the best bucks team. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=570.16s)]
*  Um, the sons make it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=572.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=574.4s)]
*  And I think there's a bunch of teams that were like, Oh, we could have [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  beaten that if this had happened or this had happened or this had happened. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=577.68s)]
*  And that ends up being our finals and the bucks wins, but bucks win. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=580.36s)]
*  But I think the 22 bucks team, you could make a case of Middleton's healthy that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=584.0s)]
*  year that they're probably a better team than the 21 team. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=588.88s)]
*  So anyway, a whole bunch of what ifs from the what if career standpoint, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=591.92s)]
*  Walton's still number one for me because he just wins multiple titles in the late [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=596.04s)]
*  seventies and goes down as one of the best 15 guys ever. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=600.64s)]
*  He, Kawhi is second. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=605.0s)]
*  And then my other two for my lifetime were Andrew Tony, who really only played [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=606.6s)]
*  five years and then his feet went on him. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=610.48s)]
*  But I just think would have been a hall of fame to guard and probably the second [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=612.64s)]
*  best to guard in the league behind Jordan. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=616.12s)]
*  And then Bernard King was the other one, the 28 he's 28 years old when he [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=618.24s)]
*  blew out his knee, he was averaging 33 a game that year, which in 19 mid [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=621.48s)]
*  80s standards is like 40. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=625.76s)]
*  Um, and came back, but was never really the same, but was the, you know, he [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=628.0400000000001s)]
*  was the forward scoring Michael Jordan of that era. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=632.72s)]
*  And then the only other one I have is Yao. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=635.24s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up Yao because I was the one where it's like, ah, man, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=638.12s)]
*  we kind of forget that Yao only played like eight years. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  Ralph Sampson. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=645.72s)]
*  Sampson's a good one. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't, I'm not sure he knew where he got hurt, but I'm not, I've always felt [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=648.76s)]
*  like he spent four years in college and then it's like, am I a center? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=653.24s)]
*  Why am I in the perimeter this much? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=657.24s)]
*  I'm never sure he totally figured that out from like a ceiling standpoint. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=658.72s)]
*  Yao could have been 23 and 10 for like 15 years, but I think the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=662.48s)]
*  China national team murdered him. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=667.36s)]
*  And then there's some other ones. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=669.08s)]
*  There's like the TMAC and C web, but those are guys like they had good [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=669.92s)]
*  careers and they got hurt a little bit later. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=673.92s)]
*  Um, but I think those are my five. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=676.52s)]
*  Anybody else you have? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=678.52s)]
*  Well, there are some, it depends how, um, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=679.64s)]
*  how, what if you want to, I mean, lend bias. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=682.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=687.3199999999999s)]
*  So I'm glad you brought up Yao because I just did, I just did to point to your [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=689.8399999999999s)]
*  point about how unique Kawhi's career is. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=694.0s)]
*  I just did a search on best or reference people in the hall of fame, um, with [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=696.56s)]
*  player efficiency ratings for their career PR, everyone craps on it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  I was like a useful, like, if I just need to catch all, like, was this guy good? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=706.24s)]
*  How was he? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=710.12s)]
*  PR above 22 for their career. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=710.64s)]
*  Kauai's regular season is 23.2. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=712.64s)]
*  I think. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=715.64s)]
*  Um, and cause I wanted to see how many guys hall of fame that elite level and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=716.52s)]
*  how many played fewer than Kauai minutes wise, I think Kauai's are about 23,000 [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=722.64s)]
*  career regular season minutes. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=727.2s)]
*  There's only, there's only three guys in the hall of fame that meet that PR [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=729.08s)]
*  standard and played fewer minutes than Kauai. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=733.44s)]
*  One is George Mike in, okay. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=735.4s)]
*  Like original NBA, you know, dinosaur, but innovator, ABA commissioner, all that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  One is Neil Johnston fifties Philadelphia, where probably made your book of basketball. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=742.8s)]
*  Bill Russell kind of took them out. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=747.9599999999999s)]
*  And the third is Yao Ming. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=749.6s)]
*  And so that was a name that I thought of right away when I, and before I did that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=751.68s)]
*  search, he only played 15,818 career minutes. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=755.9599999999999s)]
*  And, but obviously unlike Yao, Kawhi is a multi-time champion, multi-time finals, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=759.16s)]
*  MVP, there's just, there's, and then you go right. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=763.36s)]
*  And then there's a, a Neil Johnson played 18,300 minutes, and then there's a [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=766.76s)]
*  10,000 minute jump to the next guy on this list and it's Dr. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=771.0s)]
*  J who obviously played in the ABA too. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=774.8399999999999s)]
*  So he's got other, like, there's just, there's a 10,000 minute gap between those [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=776.5999999999999s)]
*  two guys and Kawhi's right in the middle of it. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=781.28s)]
*  Well, and then you think there's only three guys who ever won finals MVP for two [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  teams and the other two are LeBron and Kareem. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  I have my 42 club that I still stand by as one of the dumbest, but accurate. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=791.04s)]
*  Is the way, is that the one that cuts off Carl Malone or cut? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=795.36s)]
*  Yeah, I got to 42 because it was the best way to cut off as many Carl [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=798.1600000000001s)]
*  Malone seasons as possible points, rebounds and assists. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=801.96s)]
*  Poor, poor guy. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=805.5200000000001s)]
*  Sorry, Carl. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=807.24s)]
*  No, don't be sorry. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  If you go 42 club who made the finals since Michael Jordan, Shaq has three, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=809.88s)]
*  LeBron has six, Kobe wants to know one. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=817.6400000000001s)]
*  Iverson wants no one didn't win the title. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=821.44s)]
*  Duncan and Oh three 45.4. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=824.44s)]
*  Kauai 19 45.4. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=827.36s)]
*  Yonis and 21 48.1. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=830.12s)]
*  Yokos in 23 53.5 and Luca last year 47.0. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  Gives you a sense of first of all, how great that 19 season was, but then also [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=838.0s)]
*  like that's where we are and the only outlier in all that is probably Iverson. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=843.12s)]
*  Who just, he took a ton of shots, but wasn't like a points rebounds, assists, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=849.04s)]
*  like how some of these other ones, even Kobe only made it once. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=855.36s)]
*  Um, and then the other thing with Kauai, um, well, how many guys have gone from [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=858.32s)]
*  incredible glue guy to awesome a plus list score? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=867.2s)]
*  I was trying to think like SGA Kauai was a better glue guy than SGA. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=873.36s)]
*  But where you thought their career was going to be one thing and then it [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=879.04s)]
*  became something completely different. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=882.64s)]
*  How many guys can you think of who were like, wow, I just didn't see this. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  Cause we, we were working together and we were going to those finals games. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=892.28s)]
*  I never thought Kauai would be a guy who averaged 30 a game in the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=897.16s)]
*  playoffs that was inconceivable. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=899.96s)]
*  Well, I remember after the first Spurs heat final that the Spurs lose the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=902.0s)]
*  Ray Allen game and all that, he had moments in that series. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=906.12s)]
*  I don't have his game log up in front of me now, but he had moments in that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=911.8s)]
*  series where it was like, Ooh, something, something's interesting is happening [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=914.36s)]
*  with this Kauai like he's, he's guarding LeBron like that. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=918.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=921.28s)]
*  Fine. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=921.48s)]
*  Like he's a great defensive player. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=921.88s)]
*  Actually, let me bring up his game log as I'm talking, but he's guarding LeBron. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=923.52s)]
*  Uh, he's guarding LeBron comfortably by the way. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=927.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=929.52s)]
*  And LeBron respects him already. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=929.92s)]
*  And now he has games I'm looking at here. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=931.52s)]
*  Here's his last three games of the, of, uh, those 2013, 13 or 14, 13, the one [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=933.16s)]
*  they lose, um, to, to Miami, 16 points on six of eight shooting, 22 points. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=938.8s)]
*  And 11 rebounds on nine to 14 shooting game seven, 19. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=944.84s)]
*  Now I miss is a big free throw in game six. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=948.64s)]
*  Obviously people remember that 19 and 16 on eight of 17 in game seven, 45 minutes, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=950.24s)]
*  46 minutes a game before he has double digit rebounds in five of the seven games. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=956.04s)]
*  I remember before the next season, I wrote a piece about this cause this for [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=961.04s)]
*  Grantland, this guy is the biggest X factor in the league this year. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=966.12s)]
*  And I was like the only time I think I ever got a one-on-one interview with Kauai. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=970.12s)]
*  I called the Spurs. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=973.56s)]
*  I was like, Hey, I'm writing all about this kid. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=974.8399999999999s)]
*  They keep us a kid back then, whatever. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=977.04s)]
*  And I remember their PR guy, Tom James was like, this will, this, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=978.88s)]
*  this will be your one for the year. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=983.0s)]
*  Like don't, don't call and ask for pop. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=984.4399999999999s)]
*  He was being polite about it, but like, you know, the Spurs are, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=986.28s)]
*  it's like, you're not getting popped. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=988.4s)]
*  Like this will be the one. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=989.24s)]
*  But like, I think it's a good idea. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=990.0s)]
*  You should do it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=991.8s)]
*  And then he ends up winning finals, MVP, making me look really, really smart, but [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=992.96s)]
*  you could see enough in that first finals or it was like, okay, something [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=996.96s)]
*  different is going on, something more is here, but again, to be an MVP candidate [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1001.36s)]
*  and a guy who have, you know, we'll go through his playoff numbers, but even [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1007.24s)]
*  then, even in the 2014 finals, I don't think you could see that coming. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1010.88s)]
*  He was kind of like MVP by you had to pick a spur and he was, you know, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1013.8s)]
*  it was such a team win and he did, you know, LeBron's numbers are actually [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1019.64s)]
*  pretty good when you look back at that series, but he did a good job of at [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1024.08s)]
*  least going toe to toe with LeBron, which is why I think he won and his stats were [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1027.28s)]
*  good. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1030.52s)]
*  He was in an interesting spot there. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1031.0s)]
*  The first couple of years we were working together where he was the go-to [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1032.76s)]
*  guy. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1036.36s)]
*  If you were talking about, you know, who I really love. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1036.6s)]
*  And he was the guy like, who's that now in 2025 or the, you know, I really love. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1039.84s)]
*  Uh, it's like, it's like a Jalen Johnson, like those guys. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1046.48s)]
*  But on a better team, but those kind of like Evan Mobley or Kate Cunningham [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1049.44s)]
*  before this year, right. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1052.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1054.2800000000002s)]
*  Um, maybe not even quite quite that, but he didn't have the pedigree of those guys. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1055.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1059.16s)]
*  But it was one of those things coming out of the gate where they were like, yeah, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1059.44s)]
*  there's something here with this guy. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1063.16s)]
*  But I always thought his, I thought he was going to be Pippen and Pippen was a [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1064.4s)]
*  better, like kind of passer creator than him. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1069.0800000000002s)]
*  He had the ball more than who I did, but to me, the best still to this day, the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1072.44s)]
*  best three perimeter players I've ever seen in person. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1076.6000000000001s)]
*  And maybe, maybe a man Thompson can get here, but maybe, I don't know. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1079.72s)]
*  What is he? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  22, but the best I've ever seen in person, Pippen one, Kawhi and Rodman. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1086.0s)]
*  If I'm just talking about, I need a long athleticism. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1092.24s)]
*  I need a long athletic perimeter to shut down this score. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1094.88s)]
*  Who am I picking? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1098.0800000000002s)]
*  Those are the three guys. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1099.0800000000002s)]
*  And then after that we can argue, but those three guys have to be on the list. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1100.68s)]
*  Is there anybody else you would add? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1105.48s)]
*  For defense, I'd have to sit and think about it for a second, but I mean, you [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1107.28s)]
*  know, Gary Payton wasn't big enough to be in this conversation, right? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1111.36s)]
*  Like, is it, um, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1115.32s)]
*  you're talking about guys who could guard everybody from LeBron James to Tony Parker. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1117.0s)]
*  Like you just, anybody basically from six one to six 10, they can handle. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1122.32s)]
*  And also maybe even like, you could throw Kawhi at Yoke-Age at this point. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1126.8799999999999s)]
*  And it's not like crazy. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1130.0s)]
*  I'll give you this one too. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1131.52s)]
*  Um, I'm going to, I sound like an old man. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1132.96s)]
*  It's not that long ago, but like, he's still a very good defender. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1136.88s)]
*  Now, like if he were healthy and played the whole year, he'd be in the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1139.64s)]
*  all defense conversation that that's, he's still that good. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1142.4s)]
*  Peak Kawhi, like 2016 to 18, 19 defensive player of the year, candidate [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1146.68s)]
*  Kawhi was legitimately terrifying. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1152.4s)]
*  And to the point that he would turn entire games, entire games by himself, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1155.96s)]
*  like steel dunk, block, dunk, steel, three pointer and be like, what just happened? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1162.24s)]
*  Did that one guy just go on a nine Oh run? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1168.52s)]
*  And I remember the most underrated playoff series. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1171.0s)]
*  I think maybe anyone has ever played is that year. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1173.28s)]
*  Um, Kawhi against Memphis in 2017 in the first round, like a, like a whole [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1177.28s)]
*  home Memphis team dispersion to one that series was like incredible in that [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1183.52s)]
*  series and did everything for that team. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1187.92s)]
*  And, and just like people can go back and look it up. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1190.52s)]
*  But I like, remember the Ben McLemore thing? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1193.24s)]
*  I think he ruined Ben McLemore's career because Ben McLemore tried to dribble [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1196.28s)]
*  within like a 10 foot radius of Kawhi and Kawhi just took the ball out of his [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1200.52s)]
*  hands, two possessions in a row and went and dunked on the other end. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1204.64s)]
*  I wanted to write a story about that. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1208.52s)]
*  I approached Ben McLemore's people once and I was like, can I write this story? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1209.8000000000002s)]
*  And then again, I don't think he wants to talk about that. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1214.1200000000001s)]
*  Still not ready. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1216.6000000000001s)]
*  But he ended up writing something different about him. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1217.96s)]
*  He is quite an, he was very sweet guy and had an interesting arc to his career. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1220.1200000000001s)]
*  But like peak Kawhi, if you were not like an A level dribbler, you could not [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1223.96s)]
*  dribble anywhere near him, you would just take the ball from him. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1229.96s)]
*  Well, I remember one of my last pieces I wrote for Grantland. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1232.3200000000002s)]
*  We did this art drawing. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1236.3600000000001s)]
*  Cause I was talking, we were talking about how Kawhi was like an octopus. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1238.28s)]
*  He, he hit this level the second half of that 2015 season coming off the finals [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1243.2s)]
*  MVP and that second half of the season. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1247.8s)]
*  Where there was a lot of storylines going right? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  Like Curry, the Warriors are winning 67 games. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1254.56s)]
*  Curry's about to win an MVP. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1257.0s)]
*  Blake has become one of the best five guys in the league. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1258.68s)]
*  LeBron's in his first Cleveland season. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1261.36s)]
*  Harden has started to really kick ass on Houston. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1263.2s)]
*  And it felt like this sea change of like this new generation of guys taking over [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1266.0s)]
*  kind of taking the steering wheel of the league. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1271.36s)]
*  And then Kawhi was in there just wrecking everybody. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1273.96s)]
*  And I remember we did this octopus drawing of him and it's, you can find it [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1276.16s)]
*  probably in the one of the last grand, but Kawhi's face on this octopus. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1279.68s)]
*  Cause he would just kind of be on the quarterback. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1283.44s)]
*  I'm just going to take the ball and he would just go over and like grab the ball. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1285.76s)]
*  But you can see the moment when he would decide, actually, I [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1289.3600000000001s)]
*  think I can just get the ball. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1293.0400000000002s)]
*  Like you're going to make it like everything's normal. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1294.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm just, how about I just take it? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1296.4s)]
*  I'm just going to grab it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1298.24s)]
*  So that stretchy hat on the spurs, basically from the second half of 15, 16, 17, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1299.3200000000002s)]
*  leading to him stepping on Zaza's foot. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1305.6s)]
*  Um, he was as good as any, and we have Durant, Hummin on OKC at that point. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1308.8s)]
*  We have kind of the last stages at Carmelo. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1316.24s)]
*  We have LeBron on Cleveland. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1318.48s)]
*  Um, we have a lot of good forwards and it's just this amazing forward stretch. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1320.3999999999999s)]
*  I have him, I was thinking most talented, small forwards of my lifetime. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1324.4399999999998s)]
*  Just talented. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1328.48s)]
*  I'm not going best career in that stuff. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1329.6799999999998s)]
*  And LeBron's one and Bird's two. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1331.48s)]
*  And then Kawhi versus Durant, if you're just talking Apex, it's pretty good. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1333.24s)]
*  It's a pretty good argument. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1338.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1340.0s)]
*  That's almost a three A three B thing. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1340.36s)]
*  And I don't, Durant's had a better career because he was more durable. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1342.3999999999999s)]
*  Um, I don't know the answer. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1345.92s)]
*  It's, it's actually kind of amazing and speaks to how great he was during, you [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1348.24s)]
*  know, that five or six year stretch, um, that he's a six time all star because it [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1352.96s)]
*  doesn't feel like he's been healthy enough to get his prime to be a six time all star. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1358.32s)]
*  It's just when he's minimally healthy, it's so obvious that he's one of the five [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1362.0s)]
*  to eight best players in the league that he just makes the all star team every year. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1366.2s)]
*  The Durant one is interesting. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1369.68s)]
*  Durant's got the height and the quick twitch shooting from any, any range ability. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1371.28s)]
*  This, the bulk and defense, uh, and just, you can't move him at all. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1377.52s)]
*  That Kawhi brings both of them are their assist numbers. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1382.48s)]
*  Durant's probably a little higher, but broadly similar in that they're not a [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1385.92s)]
*  primary creator, they're more of a, they're more of a, they're more of a, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1389.08s)]
*  more secondary creator. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1392.0s)]
*  It's, it's, I mean, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1393.28s)]
*  it's an interesting, it's an interesting one. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1397.08s)]
*  Well, one other thing with both of them, there was a little bit of a Swiss [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1399.4s)]
*  army knife with each where I felt like you could play Kawhi at either forward [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1402.68s)]
*  spot and get away with it, right? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1405.88s)]
*  You could play Durant. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1407.44s)]
*  I mean, you weren't, it's not awesome to play him at small forward, but you [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1410.2s)]
*  could do it, but really you could, he has the ability to go, you go stretch [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1413.2s)]
*  five with him and just go smaller or you can play him with the center. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1416.8s)]
*  Um, it was just a more flexibility in a lineup that maybe LeBron had up [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1420.6s)]
*  until later in his career where LeBron was like, he needed certain things around him. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1425.84s)]
*  Those guys, you could kind of mold if you, whatever your roster is, you [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1430.6399999999999s)]
*  could kind of mold them a little bit. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1433.92s)]
*  But I really think those are the four best quote unquote small forwards [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1435.96s)]
*  I've seen in my lifetime. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1441.04s)]
*  Can I, these are, these are great names. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1442.6s)]
*  Can I just do it, read you another list of things I got from best [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1444.76s)]
*  wall reference, searching around. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1447.6s)]
*  Uh, I just did, um, Playoffs. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1450.0s)]
*  These are playoff numbers. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1453.8s)]
*  Again, PR is not a perfect stat. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1455.3999999999999s)]
*  Good catch. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1457.2s)]
*  Oh, Kawhi's career playoff PR is 24.3. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1457.6399999999999s)]
*  It's higher than his regular season. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1460.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1462.2s)]
*  Or that, that alone is an accomplishment, by the way, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1462.48s)]
*  the perimeter guy that's really high. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1464.68s)]
*  If you can maintain your efficiency stat, if you're an elite player and you can [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1466.48s)]
*  just maintain your regular season efficiency into the better competition [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1470.04s)]
*  of the playoffs, that alone is an accomplishment to go up a mini level [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1473.96s)]
*  is a big, big deal. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1478.2s)]
*  So I did above a 24 PR at least 4,000 minutes in the playoffs. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1479.32s)]
*  Kawhi's at 5009, I think. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1485.2s)]
*  So you got to have been there a decent amount of time and you [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1487.32s)]
*  maintain a 24 efficiency, 24 PR. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1490.24s)]
*  Eight guys total have ever done it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1494.16s)]
*  And I'll go in order of their player efficiency ratings. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1496.68s)]
*  Number one, Michael Jordan, 28.6. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1499.6000000000001s)]
*  Number two, LeBron James, 27.9. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1502.52s)]
*  Number three, Shaq, 26.1. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1506.16s)]
*  Number four, I still think for my money, maybe the most criminally underrated [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1509.2s)]
*  player in the history of the NBA, Akima Lajuan, 25.7. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1513.04s)]
*  Not by me, not in this house. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1516.4s)]
*  Number five is a tie at 24.3. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1518.4s)]
*  And it's just too good that it's a tie. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1522.3200000000002s)]
*  Tim Duncan and Kawhi. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1524.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1526.64s)]
*  And then right below them at 24.2 is Barkley, who has the fewest [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1528.16s)]
*  playoff minutes of this group. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1532.56s)]
*  And right below Barkley is Durant at 24 flat. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1534.32s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1536.8799999999999s)]
*  That's the whole list. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1537.72s)]
*  The legend's not in there? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1539.04s)]
*  I'll look up his playoff PR. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1541.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I know I should have anticipated your level of concern. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1543.84s)]
*  He's the last couple of years, a little rocky. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1548.12s)]
*  Wearing the back brace. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1550.48s)]
*  Career PR in the playoffs. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1552.6s)]
*  Probably like 23? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  21.4. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1556.28s)]
*  Ah, the legend. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1557.6399999999999s)]
*  But he's got a 26 to 24. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1558.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's different. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1561.12s)]
*  It's PR, yeah. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1562.08s)]
*  Well, I have my own basketball reference list. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1564.6399999999999s)]
*  You had to play at least 20 games in a playoff season. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1568.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1571.4399999999998s)]
*  You'd score at least 30 points. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1572.9199999999998s)]
*  Per game. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1575.48s)]
*  Per game. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1576.72s)]
*  You had to get at least six rebounds. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1577.52s)]
*  Here's that list. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1579.6399999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1580.52s)]
*  So 30, hold on. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1580.8s)]
*  Let me 30 and six in at least 20. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1581.9199999999998s)]
*  Playoff games. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1584.52s)]
*  So it's 20 plus games. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1585.08s)]

*  Yannis, LeBron a third time, Jokic. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1595.96s)]
*  That's our list. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1600.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it lends crea- I mean, when you said top 15 earlier in the podcast, I, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1603.6s)]
*  I mean, again, you're getting into sacred territory there in my initial- [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1609.32s)]
*  You're at least near Durant. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1612.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1614.28s)]
*  You're, you're in that, you're in that, you're in that, you're in that, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1614.72s)]

*  Yeah, you're, you're in the Dirk, maybe a little edge above Dirk and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1621.32s)]
*  you're in the Durant area. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1625.6s)]
*  It's, it's pretty sacred territory. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1627.68s)]
*  And now that we're going through these lists, I, I, I can't argue against it. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1629.48s)]
*  That the what if is that, is that severe and the what if ceiling is, is that high? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1635.8s)]
*  Your guy, Hakim, 95, 22 playoff games, 33 points a game, 10.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1642.04s)]
*  Some- [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1651.96s)]
*  If you're criminally underrating Hakim, you can go to hell. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1652.48s)]
*  You know, you know who's not criminally underrating Hakim from 1995? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1655.6399999999999s)]
*  Dave, David Robinson. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1659.28s)]
*  Or Shaquille O'Deal. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1660.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, or Shaq, that's right. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1661.96s)]
*  Or either of those guys. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1663.08s)]
*  Um, yeah, two, couple other quick things with him. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1664.6799999999998s)]
*  Three first team OMBs, three second team OMBs. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1669.28s)]
*  That's it for Kawhi. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1671.96s)]
*  Cause he kept getting hurt. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1673.12s)]
*  You could say he's- [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1674.76s)]
*  Still like a lot. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1675.48s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1676.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1676.84s)]
*  It's a nice one. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1678.0s)]
*  You could say he's responsible for title teams in San Antonio, Toronto, and maybe [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1679.6399999999999s)]
*  Oklahoma City this year because he wants the Quipper. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1686.12s)]
*  I'm only coming to the Quippers if you give me Paul George and that leads to, you know- [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1691.3999999999999s)]
*  Lots of stuff that's still, still going on. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1697.3600000000001s)]
*  The last 10 years of the playoff games, including the two that we've just had, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1700.5200000000002s)]
*  2016 through the 25 playoffs, he's 28 and eight, 51% shooting, 39% from three, 88%. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1704.6000000000001s)]
*  66 games. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1714.7600000000002s)]
*  It's a 10 year stretch, kept getting hurt. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1715.96s)]
*  And then, oh, in the 2019 Raptors, 39, four assists, 49% field goal for the whole [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1718.8000000000002s)]
*  playoffs. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1725.48s)]
*  But here's the other thing with him. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1726.4s)]
*  And this is crazy. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1728.8000000000002s)]
*  733 regular season games total. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1729.5600000000002s)]
*  That's his career, which seems low considering he was in the 2011 draft. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1732.1200000000001s)]
*  726 winning percentage all time. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1736.3600000000001s)]
*  Six. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1739.3600000000001s)]
*  It's Tim Duncan 2.0. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1739.92s)]
*  It's this, it's incredible. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1741.24s)]
*  The symmetry of those. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1742.48s)]
*  So here's the list. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1743.28s)]
*  Magic Bird, Casey Jones, Cooper, Tommy Hineson, Kawhi, Duncan, Sam Jones, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1744.2s)]
*  Sam Jones, Russell is our top nine. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1750.24s)]
*  So a bunch of- [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1753.6000000000001s)]
*  When I play, my team wins almost 73% of the time. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1755.12s)]
*  And yet I can't stay on the court. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1759.8799999999999s)]
*  And by the way, their Cooper fans probably listen to this going, you [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1761.36s)]
*  motherfuckers, he's going to get hurt in game three because you guys did the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1764.32s)]
*  segment, but there's never been a career like this where he might be. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1767.32s)]
*  He might end up being like the best guy in the West for the next, you know, this [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1775.08s)]
*  round and the next two, which, you know, I didn't see you talked about giving up [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1779.2s)]
*  on this. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1783.32s)]
*  I gave up on giving up on this. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1784.2s)]
*  I was like three levels beyond giving up on this, even when he came back [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1785.84s)]
*  during the season, I was like, all right, this is stupid. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1789.76s)]
*  He's just going to get hurt. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1792.12s)]
*  Even, even as you're watching the Clippers finish at whatever 16 and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1792.9199999999998s)]
*  whatever, they've had an incredible last 35 games. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1797.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1800.8s)]
*  And he looks incredible. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1801.96s)]
*  And you are saying out loud what, what is completely reasonable, which is that. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1804.1599999999999s)]
*  In your opinion, this is the second best team in the Western conference. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1810.6399999999999s)]
*  And I'm watching it and I'm like, yeah, that makes total sense. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1814.1599999999999s)]
*  And my brain just can't even, it still puts them over here in like a separate [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1818.24s)]
*  category of the standings, just because I just never believed we would see it [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1823.76s)]
*  again, I just, I wouldn't allow myself to, and again, he hasn't finished a season [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1828.76s)]
*  since 2020, but I'm glad he brought it back to this year because I think this [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1833.24s)]
*  is the coolest thing happening in basketball right now. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1837.68s)]
*  And I, I don't know how far this team can get if he stays healthy and plays like [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1840.72s)]
*  this, but it's minimal conference finals. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1846.04s)]
*  I think they could be, I don't know. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1847.88s)]
*  I don't want to put a ceiling on it. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1849.6000000000001s)]
*  Thunder are going to be favored against anybody. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1851.24s)]
*  Um, well, I guess not minimal conference finals because they're in the [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1853.68s)]
*  thunder's bracket, so we'll see where they can go. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1856.52s)]
*  But would you rather catch the thunder sooner or later? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1859.6000000000001s)]
*  Would you rather catch the thunder after they've just completely [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1862.28s)]
*  demolished this crappy Memphis team? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1864.68s)]
*  And now all of a sudden they're moving up in weight class. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1866.72s)]
*  I liked, by the way, I like that one game to adjust almost. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1869.72s)]
*  I liked your silos idea that if you lose by 50 or more in game one, it [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1872.92s)]
*  counts as two, a two wins for the team. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1876.2800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they try to push that through. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1879.0s)]
*  But I will say like, not only is this about Kawhi, I think, I think the [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1881.0400000000002s)]
*  Clippers are the team of the year, the franchise of the year, almost in the NBA. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1886.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the thunder are the obvious choice because they won 68 games and [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1890.92s)]
*  they're just incredibly well set up for now and tomorrow to, to a level [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1894.04s)]
*  that no team has ever been. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1897.24s)]
*  But for the Clippers to win 50 games and be looking like this in the postseason [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1898.68s)]
*  after they lost Paul George and everyone, including me, just wrote this entire [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1904.68s)]
*  year off is now we're just killing time until we pivot into a rebuild and we get [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1908.48s)]
*  our picks back, it'll be cool. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1912.52s)]
*  We were saying like, you're only doing this because you have a new arena. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1913.56s)]
*  This is fool's gold. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1917.56s)]
*  You just want to bring people in and make them feel okay that they can [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1919.1599999999999s)]
*  recognize a couple of players. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1922.56s)]
*  And the front office was like, actually, I think we signed some pretty good [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1923.9199999999998s)]
*  role players in free agency and we have a lot of faith in Zubots to make another [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1927.24s)]
*  level and if Kawhi ever can play and we're doing our best, we feel like we're [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1931.04s)]
*  still like a pretty, and they didn't, I don't even think they expected it. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1934.8799999999999s)]
*  I think they thought we could be like a cool 46 win, tough as nails, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1938.6799999999998s)]
*  defensive oriented team. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1943.28s)]
*  And for them to be this is incredible. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1945.36s)]
*  It's an incredible job by the coaching staff, Tai Lu, Jeff Van Gundy, the whole [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1948.4399999999998s)]
*  staff. I think they're like the franchise of the year in the NBA, maybe [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1951.92s)]
*  second to the thunder, I guess. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1955.72s)]
*  You can't undersell what an incredible accomplishment it is for them to be a 50 [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1956.8000000000002s)]
*  win team and going toe to toe with the best player in the world in a playoff [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1962.48s)]
*  series in the middle to upper half of the Western Conference bracket. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1967.6000000000001s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1972.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, and they know they could play with OKC. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  They have a real identity, which I think is so hard to find. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1976.16s)]
*  And there's two teams in the East that have an identity. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1979.12s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1984.36s)]
*  The Knicks do not have an identity. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1986.08s)]
*  They just do not. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1987.7199999999998s)]
*  Concerning first couple of games. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1988.32s)]
*  They do not have an identity. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1989.6399999999999s)]
*  Remember when I, when we did that pod and I said Tibbs was my wild card. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1991.32s)]
*  Don't be surprised. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1995.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm feeling better about that. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1996.52s)]
*  Can I give you a third? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=1998.0s)]
*  Oh boy, I'm just supposed to be identity teams. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2000.08s)]
*  Pacers Pacers have an identity. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2002.3999999999999s)]
*  No good call. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2004.2399999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2005.08s)]
*  I'll accept it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2005.6s)]
*  Um, Clippers have an identity and unfortunately it's built around this [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2006.72s)]
*  awesome player and they just kind of never know with him, you know, and they view [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2011.36s)]
*  like I heard Marcus Morris today. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2016.04s)]
*  I saw him on ESPN talking as he played with quiet. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2017.64s)]
*  He loves them. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2019.76s)]
*  And he was like, why was the first guy there? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2020.88s)]
*  Like the guy works his ass off. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2022.48s)]
*  He gets this reputation that he doesn't, but the guy worked as [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2024.04s)]
*  hard as any team that I had. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2027.44s)]
*  But if you talk to people around the Clippers and Kawhi is always this thing, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2029.08s)]
*  like, yeah, we don't know. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2033.6s)]
*  He does his own thing. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2034.8s)]
*  We he's kind of over here and we just kind of keep our fingers crossed [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2035.76s)]
*  that he's going to be awesome. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2039.76s)]
*  The difference this time versus some of the other times, he just looks good. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2040.6s)]
*  Like when you watch him, like his side to side stuff and the athleticism, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2046.28s)]
*  it feels like it's back. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2050.6s)]
*  He's got lift on his jumper. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2051.68s)]
*  Like he made a couple of jumpers last night in traffic with a hand in his [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2053.16s)]
*  face and he's able to elevate now like he used to, and he just has that [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2057.48s)]
*  mind drive shot he can get over anybody. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2061.04s)]
*  And he's such a weird player. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2063.72s)]
*  There's no player like him now. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2064.96s)]
*  Who's like, I just want to get this 14 footer. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2066.8s)]
*  I just want to get to my spot and get it and I'm going to get it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2070.16s)]
*  And, you know, so that's why he's always been an elite postseason player. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2072.7200000000003s)]
*  Among many other things is that there is some truth to the idea that in [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2076.64s)]
*  the playoffs, you need a little bit more than in the regular season, at least [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2080.44s)]
*  you need some guys who can get those shots and he can get like the last shot [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2084.76s)]
*  he made last night to put the Clippers up at 105, 102. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2089.04s)]
*  I think it was. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2093.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2094.0s)]
*  This is the last shot of the game. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2094.16s)]
*  Um, the last basket of the game, they ran a pick and roll to try and get [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2096.48s)]
*  Jamal Murray switched onto him. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2099.8s)]
*  And for maybe the first time in the entire game, the nuggets decided, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2101.12s)]
*  we're not giving you this switch. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2104.56s)]
*  We're going to hedge with Jamal Murray. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2105.84s)]
*  Risk leaving the screener who I think was Norm Powell open and figure that [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2108.32s)]
*  part out, we're just not taking Aaron Gordon off you. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2111.92s)]
*  And he was like, cool. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2114.84s)]
*  Like Aaron Gordon is a tank. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2116.0s)]
*  I'm, I'm totally cool with this. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2117.32s)]
*  I'm still going to get to my spot. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2118.8s)]
*  And he looked, he made that jumper from the right wing over Aaron [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2120.3199999999997s)]
*  Gordon, and it was vintage Kawhi, the height, the trajectory, the ease [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2124.12s)]
*  with which he got there against the defender, who's one of the only guys [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2128.8399999999997s)]
*  in the league who can match his size, strength and athleticism. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2131.7999999999997s)]
*  And it was just like walk in the freaking park. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2134.96s)]
*  Denver was basically an underdog heading into the series. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2139.24s)]
*  Clippers were minus one 18 favorites. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2144.08s)]
*  Denver wins game one. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2145.9199999999996s)]
*  I talked about this Sunday night. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2147.68s)]
*  It flips just a little. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2150.3199999999997s)]
*  So Denver became a minus one 18 favorite. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2153.04s)]
*  Whereas the Minnesota things flipped wildly now on Fandall. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2155.56s)]
*  The Clippers are minus one 80 to win the series. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  And honestly, if, if you, if you tell me you know, way to know this, but if you're [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2163.7999999999997s)]
*  like, why is playing the rest of the series and it'll be at the level you're saying, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2169.0s)]
*  I don't see how Denver wins. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2172.16s)]
*  I also think Denver has some real issues. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2173.3599999999997s)]
*  It goes beyond the Westbrook stuff. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2175.56s)]
*  It's, it's just Rocky. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2177.3199999999997s)]
*  Like you gotta be for what this Clippers team is with Kawhi. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2178.48s)]
*  You have to be pretty sure of who you are and what you are. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2181.48s)]
*  And the nuggets, all they know is that Yoko is just fucking awesome. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2184.36s)]
*  And I don't think they know anything else about their team. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2188.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2190.2400000000002s)]
*  And they beyond six guys, they don't even know who the seventh guy is. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2191.12s)]
*  And he's getting frustrated too. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2194.6s)]
*  Um, he's getting frustrated with the officials. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2196.8s)]
*  He's been pretty demonstrative, but not, not in a bad way, but with teammates trying [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2199.16s)]
*  to point them in the right direction, seven turnovers, missed some big free throws [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2204.04s)]
*  in both games, including two late in game one, only six of 10 from the line. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2208.24s)]
*  Uh, yesterday's, I mean, doesn't he look a little worn down to you too? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2212.9199999999996s)]
*  I'd be worn down carrying it. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2216.52s)]
*  Last night as a, as a giant Yoko watcher, as I know you are too, but last night, the [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2218.7999999999997s)]
*  guy seemed like he was physically beaten up last night. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2224.08s)]
*  You know, he's had 20 minor injuries, nothing major, but, um, I sound like I'm making [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2227.12s)]
*  excuses for him. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2231.9599999999996s)]
*  He sucked last night down the stretch. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2232.68s)]
*  He was bad. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2234.2s)]
*  It's funny you say that because I was, I was in my notes. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2235.0s)]
*  I was taking on the game. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2237.8799999999997s)]
*  I can't remember when it was in the game, but I'm paying very close attention to [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2239.3599999999997s)]
*  every Murray, Yoko pitch, pick and roll, how the nuggets decide to guard it. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2243.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2248.6s)]
*  Different ways, different, their default strategy has been X, Y, and Z. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2249.12s)]
*  And there were two in a row, I think in the third quarter, maybe where they didn't, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2253.2s)]
*  they didn't need to do anything dramatic. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2260.7999999999997s)]
*  They didn't even need to do the, their sort of usual response to it so far in this [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2263.0s)]
*  series, because Yoko didn't pop to three, which is dangerous for them. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2267.24s)]
*  And he didn't roll into floater area for like a pocket pass from Murray, which is [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2272.08s)]
*  a danger area for them. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2276.88s)]
*  So Zubac just kind of saw he just sort of stood at the point of the screen, like 19 [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2278.4s)]
*  feet from the basket and Zubac was like, Oh cool. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2283.32s)]
*  I can just sort of drop back and play this like a normal pick and roll. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2285.8s)]
*  And the worst case scenario is he gets a 20 foot jump shot. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2288.4s)]
*  This is, this is a nice reprieve. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2291.96s)]
*  And I just took note of those. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2293.44s)]
*  Cause I was like, I, you don't see him do that very, very often. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2294.72s)]
*  And I said in my notes, like maybe he's tired. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2299.44s)]
*  It should be, he's playing 40 gazillion minutes every night on a team that needs [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2302.16s)]
*  him to do literally everything on offense for them to survive. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2305.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2309.72s)]
*  It was four for eight from three last night. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2309.8399999999997s)]
*  I just remember it triggered me in the memories of the Minnesota series last [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2311.7599999999998s)]
*  year, when I just thought he lost his legs as that series went on because they, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2316.88s)]
*  they were just absolutely murdering him game after game. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2320.72s)]
*  And they had so many big bodies that throw them. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2323.3599999999997s)]
*  Then by the end of it, the three, the three pointer started to go. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2325.56s)]
*  When he starts missing free throws, I always feel like that's a bad sign, but I [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2329.2799999999997s)]
*  just think the burden he's carrying on this team, especially not knowing if [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2332.8399999999997s)]
*  Porter's going to show up or not. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2336.3999999999996s)]
*  Porter showed up last night and rebounded. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2337.64s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to show up for game three. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2340.0s)]
*  This seems like a team and we've watched a lot of playoffs and I'm even older than [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2341.96s)]
*  you. This seems like a team teetering on this could really go badly in these next [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2346.16s)]
*  two Cooper games, or they'll just look, Yokocho will be great in game three and [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2351.72s)]
*  it'd be like, Oh, what are we worried about? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2356.2s)]
*  But I just feel like they're like, if I go through every other team, like the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2357.48s)]
*  Knicks have real problems. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2361.0s)]
*  We knew this. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2362.16s)]
*  I don't, I didn't really change anything. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2362.7599999999998s)]
*  I thought of the Knicks other than I was surprised how well the Pistons have [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2365.0s)]
*  played the seven of the eight quarters. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2368.2s)]
*  They look good, right? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2370.6s)]
*  They had one horrible quarter and it's a one-one series. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2371.96s)]
*  The Knicks, we knew they didn't have a bench. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2375.32s)]
*  We knew they were going to have to play too many minutes with those guys. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2376.8s)]
*  Um, Denver, I could just see this going any direction now. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2380.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think the Clippers are better than them. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2384.6400000000003s)]
*  So we'll see with Kawhi, but I'm glad we captured this moment because [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2386.2000000000003s)]
*  Can I just add one more thing that is too irresistible given that this is a podcast [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2390.2000000000003s)]
*  with you. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2394.4s)]
*  I think about Kawhi a hundred nights a year, 50 nights a year for this reason. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2395.88s)]
*  And this reason only. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2403.44s)]
*  I don't even know if you remember this after the 2017 season when Russ wins the [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2404.24s)]
*  MVP and averages a triple double, you voted for Harden, I believe. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2409.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2414.24s)]
*  Um, it was the most we've ever texted about an MVP and you did a classic Zach [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2414.9199999999996s)]
*  rope a dope and you went, how though I could feel you going toward Kawhi. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2419.3199999999997s)]
*  That was one where I just felt it in my gut. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2424.3999999999996s)]
*  But anyway, so you voted for Harden and you're so proud of the vote that I [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2426.6s)]
*  believe you had the maid. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2430.8399999999997s)]
*  You were someone at Grantland had them had these shirts made. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2432.3199999999997s)]
*  I should have brought it, but it looks disgusting. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2435.3199999999997s)]
*  Right side of history, a white t-shirt and it says 2017 MVP, right side of [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2437.3999999999996s)]
*  history, and it has a photo of right and a photo of Harden and a check mark in a [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2443.2s)]
*  box next to Harden. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2449.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2450.7999999999997s)]
*  And now that's been, that's in my pajama rotations. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2451.0s)]
*  It's one of my pajama shirts. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2454.0s)]
*  So I look at it and it makes me smile, but it also pisses me off because I have the [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2455.2s)]
*  wrong vote for me on the shirt. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2459.9599999999996s)]
*  I need a Kawhi version of, I look at the shirt Kawhi's not on it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2462.08s)]
*  It's the right side of history is James Harden. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2466.0s)]
*  They're like, well, that's not my side of history, but I wear it. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2468.16s)]
*  Anyway, his pajamas. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2470.08s)]
*  So I think about the 2017 MVP, like a third of the year, cause it's pajamas. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2470.96s)]
*  Did you vote for her in second? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2476.2s)]
*  Probably. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2479.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2479.68s)]
*  I I'd have to go look it up. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2480.2799999999997s)]
*  I probably did. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2481.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2482.36s)]
*  That was the year like LeBron was fourth and you just felt like this is insane or [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2483.04s)]
*  that, you know, this is the way this is breaking. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2487.48s)]
*  How, why? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2489.44s)]
*  But there's no pro. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2490.92s)]
*  There, the LeBron MVP conversation goes every once in a while. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2492.12s)]
*  The only one he has a case for after 2013 is the 18 one when Harden beat him. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2495.16s)]
*  I voted for Harden. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2503.36s)]
*  The numbers were around the same. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2504.16s)]
*  I voted for Harden too, but Houston won 65 games and you know, Cleveland. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2505.2s)]
*  LeBron spent six straight weeks pouting and giving everyone side-eyes. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2510.52s)]
*  Which nobody remembers from basketball reference. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2515.64s)]
*  He did his whole. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2517.7599999999998s)]
*  His team. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2518.7999999999997s)]
*  It was like, I need you to trade all these, all these people. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2519.24s)]
*  Basketball reference doesn't capture that unfortunately, but that's, that's the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2521.76s)]
*  one that I think people mentioned, but Harden clearly should have won that year. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2525.0400000000004s)]
*  All right, Zach, you have a podcast coming Thursday. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2528.0800000000004s)]
*  Thursday. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2530.76s)]
*  We're going to recap everything that happens Wednesday and Tuesday, depending [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2531.2400000000002s)]
*  on which series we have time to talk about, uh, and look ahead to games threes [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2534.84s)]
*  and games fours, I think that's coming right off a, uh, Warriors rockets game [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2539.7200000000003s)]
*  two and it's coming right off. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2544.28s)]
*  Lakers wolves will have a couple of extra days of rest. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2546.8s)]
*  So we'll see if the Lakers are down. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2549.44s)]
*  Oh two, it's going to be. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2550.76s)]
*  Defcon Defcon one across the airwaves, baby. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2552.2400000000002s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2555.04s)]
*  Are you on Kaminga watch or have you just sold out your stock and given up? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2556.4s)]
*  I'm going to keep the stock because I'm going down with the ship. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2560.48s)]
*  I still, Tim Legler and I used to joke that we needed t-shirts made on that [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2563.76s)]
*  we could wear on television and the t-shirts would have just said, John, I [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2567.96s)]
*  think Kaminga is good because we were both that, that like, we both would just [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2570.88s)]
*  be like, I don't understand. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2574.2000000000003s)]
*  Like we think this guy's good. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2575.32s)]
*  Warriors fans. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2577.1600000000003s)]
*  It's incredibly polarizing. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2578.0s)]
*  Some of them just think he stinks. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2579.2s)]
*  I still think he's interesting and good, but I, you know, if they're not [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2581.16s)]
*  dusting them off now and they're winning games, I, I kind of think the ship has [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2586.64s)]
*  sailed, but you never know in the play out, the longer you would stay in the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2590.52s)]
*  playoffs, if they get through this series, you know, the matchups change, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2593.12s)]
*  someone gets hurt, you never know. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2595.8799999999997s)]
*  But I, I don't even think about him anymore. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2596.96s)]
*  Sadly. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2599.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't think Steve Kurt does either. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2601.16s)]
*  Zach, fantastic to see him. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2602.9199999999996s)]
*  So glad you're with us. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2604.8399999999997s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2605.7999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8EkAezg08&t=2606.7599999999998s)]
