# Charles Barkley Makes NFL Picks and Talks Caitlin Clark and His TV Future | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4)
*  Football season is here, which means we have to have Charles Barkley on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=0.0s)]
*  world's worst football gambler, top 20 worst football gambler. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3.94s)]
*  Where do you rank? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=8.08s)]
*  It depends on how good the team plays. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=9.24s)]
*  Hell, Eric Gambler knows your team got to play good or bad. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=11.22s)]
*  Hey man, right now I'm not going to lie. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Like two weeks ago, it was the, uh, the game over in, uh, Ireland. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  That was my first bet of the year. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=23.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=25.22s)]
*  And then last week it's full blown and now starting tomorrow with Thursday [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=26.18s)]
*  night football, which I'm not going to touch that game because I have [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=31.34s)]
*  zero idea what's going to happen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  Um, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=37.02s)]
*  well, that's never stopped you before. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=40.14s)]
*  But I like to have some information going on. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=40.44s)]
*  So, um, starting last weekend, I was good to go. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=43.58s)]
*  I'm staying away from that Brazil game. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=49.74s)]
*  Can you imagine going to Brazil and just think they're like, you [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  can't leave your hotel room for three days and then you still have to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=54.46s)]
*  play a football game too many variables. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=57.38s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=58.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=59.9s)]
*  But you know, the Eagles got a lot at stake. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=60.58s)]
*  You know, last year was a disaster and, um, they got some jobs riding on [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=63.14s)]
*  that line, man, because if they have another bad year, his are going to roll. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=69.02s)]
*  I mean, they fired Doug Peters after he won a Superbowl. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=73.94s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine if they go from losing a Superbowl to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=78.14s)]
*  tanking last year, getting stumped in the playoffs, didn't have another bad year. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=82.58s)]
*  So I'm really looking forward to this season because I think, I [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=86.58s)]
*  think they're going to be great. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  I don't think they're going to be good. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=90.78s)]
*  I think they're going to be great. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=91.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=93.38s)]
*  You're, you're, you're doubling down on the Eagles. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=94.02s)]
*  I'm surprised. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=96.62s)]
*  There hasn't been a lot of the Eagles love in this off season. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=97.3s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm an Eagles fan. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=100.38s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=102.62s)]
*  And I think this is my personal opinion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=103.58s)]
*  I'm not a football expert, but I think the coach really screwed up last year, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=106.18s)]
*  personally, what I think, because when he lost the offensive and defensive [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=110.26s)]
*  coordinator, he just hired his buddies. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=114.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=117.94s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know if that's a good idea. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=118.38s)]
*  Even if you're going to hire them, you still look at other people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=121.82s)]
*  Because I think, I think that's what I'm going to say, because, you know, one [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=125.18s)]
*  thing they don't do in the NFL, they don't fire coordinators during the regular [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=128.9s)]
*  season, they fired both of theirs in the middle of the season, which never happened. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=133.26s)]
*  That never happened. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=137.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=138.46s)]
*  There almost has to be like an HR violation for that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=138.66s)]
*  So I think, I think he made a mistake. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm a, I'm a fan of his, but I think that when he just, instead of like those, both [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=144.38s)]
*  of those guys got head coaching jobs, we'll let you know they were terrific coaches. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=149.82s)]
*  But I don't think you just hired a next man up. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=153.62s)]
*  Even if you do that, you bring in other candidates because you just never know. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=156.82s)]
*  Do you think when the Eagles won the Superbowl that changed the psyche of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  Philly fans at all, or they just as crazy as they always were? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=166.34s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=170.94s)]
*  Philadelphia is a great sports town. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=173.3s)]
*  It's kind of like, I tell people, I spent my first eight years on the East coast [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=175.22s)]
*  in Philly and no disrespect to the Lakers fans and the Bears fans are great. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=180.06s)]
*  But New York, Philly and Boston, it's a different animal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they love their sports. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=193.06s)]
*  Like I say, I played in Philly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=196.38s)]
*  I played in Houston. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=200.5s)]
*  I played in Arizona, but you know, I knew all the guys on different [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=201.58s)]
*  teams and I'm a big sports fan. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=206.82s)]
*  There's some about the East coast. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=207.1s)]
*  Like I say, I think New York and Boston and Philly, man, as far as fans, they are, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=209.78s)]
*  they love you if you, they love you if you give 110%. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=215.02s)]
*  You, you'll set for life if you win. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=218.38s)]
*  But I think there's a different type of intensity on the East coast fan. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=220.38s)]
*  That's just my opinion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=225.46s)]
*  I think it's weather related at least like 70% because you know, the weather's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=227.22s)]
*  going to suck for like five, six months. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=231.66s)]
*  You played in Phoenix where it's either super nice or it's 200 degrees and you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=233.62s)]
*  have to get the F out of there, but LA is the same way. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=237.98s)]
*  The weather's nicer all the time. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=240.78s)]
*  It's hard to get too mad about anything. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=242.14s)]
*  What's really crazy, Bill, what you said, I've actually said that before. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=243.98s)]
*  I think some of the animosity or anger toward teams and other fans, cause they're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=248.14s)]
*  stuck in the house for six, seven months a year. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=259.26s)]
*  And they have to do, I tell people when I got traded to Phoenix, it was really [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=260.46s)]
*  surreal because it was like in October, November and December in Philly, you're [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=265.18s)]
*  like, shit, it's cold. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm staying in the house. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=273.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=274.94s)]
*  It's cold. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=275.3s)]
*  I'm staying in the house. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=276.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=278.02000000000004s)]
*  Like you don't want, like you go to practice and you go home, but you're like, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=278.26000000000005s)]
*  no, I don't want to go outside because once it's cold, it's always cold. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=283.22s)]
*  You don't never have like a day was like 75 degrees in the middle of the winter. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=287.82000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=292.14000000000004s)]
*  When I got traded to Phoenix, you're like, Oh no, no, no, no, it's 72 degrees. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  I've got to go do something. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=298.3s)]
*  Like I don't, on an off day, you're like, no, no, I got to do something. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=300.70000000000005s)]
*  So I a hundred percent agree with you on the weather aspects. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=305.1s)]
*  Well, cause like Minnesota is cold. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=308.62s)]
*  Buffalo is cold. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=310.18s)]
*  Detroit's cold. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=310.94s)]
*  Places get cold. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=311.94s)]
*  I think the difference with the New York. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=312.98s)]
*  But you just named two of the best fan bases in sports. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=314.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=318.26000000000005s)]
*  The Vikings fans and the Buffalo, they are two of the best fan bases in sports. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=318.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=326.42s)]
*  I mean, and players will tell you that's done like playing in Minnesota or Buffalo. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=326.82000000000005s)]
*  They'll, those are two of the best fan bases. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=330.82000000000005s)]
*  And it's got, I do, I agree with you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=332.82000000000005s)]
*  The weather is crazy, but more spread out in those places in the cities. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=334.82s)]
*  You're on top of each other and you're just like talking to people and just [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=339.38s)]
*  getting mad about everything. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  It's also in the DNA. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=343.82s)]
*  I always felt like with Boston and Philly specifically, and that's why the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=345.02s)]
*  Paul George move into Philly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=349.74s)]
*  I, and I've said this on a pod and people are like, Oh, you're a Celtics fan. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=352.29999999999995s)]
*  You're just saying that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=355.34s)]
*  Like, I really believe it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=355.82s)]
*  Paul George has played in Indiana. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=356.74s)]
*  He's played in Oklahoma city and he's played for the Clippers. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=358.9s)]
*  We're literally in LA. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=361.74s)]
*  Nobody cares about the Clippers. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=363.02s)]
*  And now he's moving into Philly. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=364.3s)]
*  And I don't think people, I don't think people realize how intense it is, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=366.58s)]
*  especially compared to what he came from, you know? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=371.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=374.78s)]
*  But I think he has a huge advantage. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=375.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=377.42s)]
*  He's only, he's only got to be the third best player on the team. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  That's a really huge advantage for Paul because Joel is the guy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=382.18s)]
*  Maxie is the second guy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=387.9s)]
*  Paul only has to be the third best player. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=390.06s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  I say it this at the beginning of last season, of course, then just plays well. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=394.34s)]
*  Nobody going to beat the Celtics. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=399.9s)]
*  I said that the entire season, I says, Hey, and Shaq was giving me a hard time. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=402.46s)]
*  Like he's never won anywhere. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=407.21999999999997s)]
*  I says, I said, well, first of all, he had to be the number one guy or the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=408.62s)]
*  number two guy in those other places. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=413.06s)]
*  That's a whole different attitude. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=415.42s)]
*  He only has to be the third best player in Boston. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=417.74s)]
*  And you see he thrived in that position. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=420.26s)]
*  There's nobody got a third. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=423.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, you could argue between him and Drew who's the third best player, but [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=424.58000000000004s)]
*  as you saw in the finals, if he plays like that, like he played all season and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=428.74s)]
*  stays healthy, the Celtics is going to be tough to beat again this year. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=434.06s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  The problem is I'm not sure we're getting him until all-star break. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=438.66s)]
*  Cause you know how it goes with NBA injuries. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=441.98s)]
*  They're like, yeah, it should be December. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=443.66s)]
*  I just add six weeks to whatever. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=445.1s)]
*  When it's a long injury, I just add time to it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=447.86s)]
*  I never trust the teams. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=450.06s)]
*  I think the one thing that NBA did screwing up was pissing off [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=452.82s)]
*  Jalen Brown and Jason Tatum. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=456.1s)]
*  I truly believe that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=457.9s)]
*  Oh, we're doing this now? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=458.82s)]
*  I had that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=459.74s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=460.42s)]
*  No, no, I think, I think Jalen getting left off the Olympic team and Jason [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=460.9s)]
*  not playing, first of all, they were already horrific players already. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=466.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=471.66s)]
*  And I think both of them going to have the red ass. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=472.3s)]
*  That's good for me though, right? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=475.62s)]
*  I'm actually glad they got the chips on the shoulder after a title. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=476.9s)]
*  That never happens. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=480.26s)]
*  No question. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=481.5s)]
*  I think I tell people, I says, yo man, I really think both of those guys, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=482.5s)]
*  number one, they're the defending champs. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=488.22s)]
*  That's going to take their confidence to another level. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=489.62s)]
*  But the NBA, I found a way to piss both of them off this summer. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=492.14s)]
*  How about that? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=497.14s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=498.74s)]
*  And I, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=499.1s)]
*  all of the NBA can do that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=499.82s)]
*  Well, like let's piss off two of the top 10 players in the NBA after [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=502.02s)]
*  they're coming off a championship. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=507.22s)]
*  Now I don't, I seriously, I don't think maybe Isaiah Thomas was treated [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=509.26s)]
*  unfairly on a dream team, but I cannot think of any other scenario. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=514.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, the NBA pissed off two players more than they did this summer [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=520.9s)]
*  with Jason and Jalen. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=527.06s)]
*  I really believe that's sincerely. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=528.18s)]
*  Well, and you might add three because Yanis got left off Christmas. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=530.8199999999999s)]
*  They were like, yeah, you're not even a Christmas superstar anymore. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=535.3s)]
*  And I think he's, he's putting the chips on his shoulder too, but back to the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=538.3s)]
*  Tatum thing. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=542.78s)]
*  So, and I haven't, I've been saving this for you, this take. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=543.9s)]
*  So Tatum in people in my life have given me a ton of shit about Tatum and Brown [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=547.3s)]
*  and Brown not making the team and Tatum not playing. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=553.06s)]
*  And I did, I talked to a bunch of people, tried to figure out what happened. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=556.02s)]
*  You know, Tatum, they win, they, they go through the playoffs. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=560.06s)]
*  The finals ends mid June. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=563.66s)]
*  They're celebrating for a week. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=565.54s)]
*  He has a kid. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=567.2199999999999s)]
*  He misses the first two practices. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=568.14s)]
*  There's only 14 USA practices, right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=570.46s)]
*  Bunch of the guys that were there had been knocked out of the playoffs in [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=572.86s)]
*  mid April, late April, beginning of May. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=575.42s)]
*  So they come in, they're all fired up. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=578.22s)]
*  AD and Bam get to play together and just Tatum, he can't make a couple shots. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=580.14s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it just kind of goes sideways a little bit for him. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=585.18s)]
*  I think those, those Olympics has a huge advantage to the guys who haven't been [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=588.9s)]
*  doing anything since April. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=593.8199999999999s)]
*  Look at the four best guys in that team. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=594.98s)]
*  Booker, LeBron, AD, Curry. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=596.98s)]
*  Those guys were on fucking playoffs in April. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=600.62s)]
*  All they do is get ready for six games. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=604.2600000000001s)]
*  That's my Jason Tatum defense, Charles Barkley. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=606.0200000000001s)]
*  There's no reason Jason Tatum should have been playing or Halliburton. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=608.94s)]
*  They gave up their summer to represent their country. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=614.46s)]
*  There's not, there's, there's not going to be a tremendous drop off. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=617.6600000000001s)]
*  You're like, you know what, maybe I should put Jason Tatum in the game. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=621.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, you're not putting a second screen guy in there or Halliburton. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=624.3s)]
*  You're not seriously, you're not dropping off. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=629.2199999999999s)]
*  I thought they should have played more. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=633.3s)]
*  First of all, like, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=635.02s)]
*  But how do you play 12 guys in a basketball game? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=636.2199999999999s)]
*  No, you know how stupid that is. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=638.5s)]
*  Like it's, there's only 40 minutes. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=639.9s)]
*  They only played two real games. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=644.5799999999999s)]
*  Serbia and France. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=645.3s)]
*  There was four other games they could have played before then. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=647.4599999999999s)]
*  Like Jason didn't play in two games. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=652.06s)]
*  I'm like, come on. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=654.78s)]
*  And I'm not in sure how burden I'm not. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=655.5799999999999s)]
*  I only forget how many he played in that when they were playing. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=657.62s)]
*  To Dan the second time, the first time it was screwing around and barely one. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=662.74s)]
*  But when they beat for suit sedan by 25, 30 points, come on, you can't get [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=666.98s)]
*  his kid five minutes. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=671.54s)]
*  First of all, it's the Olympics. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=673.14s)]
*  You're representing your country. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=674.8199999999999s)]
*  You want to be part, you want to be part of the team. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=676.74s)]
*  You want to be part of the Olympics. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=679.86s)]
*  So, um, like I say, uh, I was disappointed, man, cause Jason's a terrific player [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=682.1800000000001s)]
*  and a great, and same thing with Halliburton. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=687.38s)]
*  Well, the thing is, I think the mistake was trying to pick the 12 bet because [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=691.0200000000001s)]
*  the woman's basketball team went through this too. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=695.38s)]
*  She only really played 10. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=698.0200000000001s)]
*  So like when you were on the dream team, Leighton was in one of the spots. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=699.62s)]
*  You knew he wasn't going to play. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=702.86s)]
*  Bird was wearing a back brace. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=704.3800000000001s)]
*  You knew he wasn't going to play that much if it actually mattered. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=706.1s)]
*  And then Stockton got hurt during the playoffs, but you really only needed nine. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=708.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=713.42s)]
*  But, but when we were blowing people out, those guys got in the game. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=713.74s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=718.74s)]
*  Like Chuck always said, Hey, I'm going to have this team going to start in certain [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=719.78s)]
*  games. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=724.2199999999999s)]
*  And I was fortunate to be one of those guys. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=724.6999999999999s)]
*  But when we're on like bird who had a bad back, when we're up 60, he can go [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=727.26s)]
*  out there and say, Hey, I played in the Olympic. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=732.74s)]
*  That's really cool. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=734.86s)]
*  That's really special. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=735.66s)]
*  Same thing with Christian Leighton. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=736.9399999999999s)]
*  Or now can you play 12 guys every game? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=738.22s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=741.38s)]
*  Well, when you are 40 points, you can't like, you can't get a Halliburton and JT [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=743.0600000000001s)]
*  five to seven minutes. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=749.14s)]
*  First of all, I don't, I'm not even still LeBron and KD like this. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=750.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=754.82s)]
*  I don't want to be out there. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=755.0600000000001s)]
*  We are 50. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=755.98s)]
*  That ain't no fun. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=756.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=758.1s)]
*  Play those other guys. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=758.78s)]
*  Uh, so, so that was my only problem with the whole scenario. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=760.82s)]
*  By the way, you in 1992 fit my Olympics theory. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=764.46s)]
*  Your, your ass got sent home. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=767.9s)]
*  Did you, I don't even know if you made the playoffs that year. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=769.38s)]
*  You were really ready for the Olympics as opposed to like MJ and Pippen had [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=771.58s)]
*  played it all through the playoffs. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=776.34s)]
*  And then you were awesome in the Olympics. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=778.02s)]
*  This is my theory. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=779.62s)]
*  It's actually an advantage when you go to the Olympics. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=781.06s)]
*  You've been knocked out. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=782.9399999999999s)]
*  The Olympics are the easiest thing to play. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=784.1s)]
*  Well, for you in 1992, no, but any year the Olympics are the easiest thing to play. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=787.06s)]
*  Same thing for me in 96. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=792.78s)]
*  Man, the better players you play with, the easier the game is. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=794.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=799.22s)]
*  Because like when you're a great player, you have to do most of the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=799.5400000000001s)]
*  heavy lifting on your own team. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=805.34s)]
*  The reason the Olympics, I say is the easiest. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=808.1s)]
*  I'm passing the ball to Patrick Jung or David Robertson. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=811.58s)]
*  Like I don't have to get every rebound. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=814.58s)]
*  I'm passing the ball to a guy I know going to make the shot. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=818.4200000000001s)]
*  You're running the floor. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=821.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=822.9s)]
*  I just have to, I just like, I got no responsibility that I have to do. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=823.3s)]
*  I know when I played for the six and the sun, I got to get 24 to 10 [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=828.34s)]
*  rebounds every single night. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=832.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=834.26s)]
*  You know, when you, when you're a star, you have to get your [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=834.46s)]
*  numbers every single night. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=838.1s)]
*  We can't have no excuses, no BS. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=839.7s)]
*  But on the Olympic team, I'm like, I just got to get 12 points, six or seven [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=842.66s)]
*  rebounds, if I move without the ball, somebody going to find me. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=847.0600000000001s)]
*  Cause I know they trust me. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=852.5s)]
*  So, so the Olympics to me are always the easiest to play. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=854.3399999999999s)]
*  I tell people that I still man, the Olympics are like going to summer camp. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=857.9799999999999s)]
*  Well, it turned into fool's gold for the Lakers fans and the Warriors fans. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=863.2199999999999s)]
*  Cause their guys look good in the, in the Olympics. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=866.86s)]
*  And now they're like, see, we could be contenders. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=869.06s)]
*  And it's like, ah, it's probably a little bit different. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=872.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, 82 game season before. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=874.42s)]
*  I don't know if you were watching our show. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=876.26s)]
*  I went off on the news media last year, made a lot of those clowns on the ESPN. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=878.7s)]
*  I'm like every day for like three months or the Lakers and the Warriors contenders. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=883.98s)]
*  I'm like, yo man, I told y'all six months ago, the Lakers stink, the Warriors stink. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=890.9s)]
*  Why do y'all talk? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=897.5s)]
*  I did, I did a whole, I'm like, why are you guys on the other network? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=898.7s)]
*  And some of the guys are friends of mine. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=903.74s)]
*  Why do y'all keep telling us the Lakers and the Warriors are good? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=905.38s)]
*  The Lakers stink, the Warriors stink. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=909.5s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=912.5799999999999s)]
*  And I, and I, then when they both got beat in a, so imaginary playoff [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=913.62s)]
*  bullshit bill that we made up to play and stuff. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=918.78s)]
*  And then the Lakers win one game against Denver. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=922.38s)]
*  I was like, Steve, now y'all do y'all thing on TV every day. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=926.02s)]
*  Talk about the, I told you the Lakers stink and the Warriors stink. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=929.9s)]
*  And right now they're not relevant either one of those teams going into the season. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=933.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=939.82s)]
*  Some of that comes from the producers, which you've, you've been pretty fortunate [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=940.22s)]
*  with in your whole Turner experience. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=944.38s)]
*  Yeah, but you can't just do that for the hell of it. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=946.0600000000001s)]
*  No, but I, I did those shows. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=948.42s)]
*  They would tell, I was doing TV during the years when, you know, the last [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=950.26s)]
*  kind of years of Kobe, when the Lakers was starting to go down and we were [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=954.42s)]
*  still leading with the Lakers. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=957.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=958.94s)]
*  They were just took talk, Kobe, talk to Lakers, talk to next. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=959.26s)]
*  Like they're just trying to hit the three biggest teams. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=963.14s)]
*  And like, I thought, okay, see last year was probably the least discussed [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=965.3s)]
*  team of all the great teams. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=969.46s)]
*  And then people were surprised when they look good in the playoffs, like casual. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=970.98s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what, and let me tell you something as good as, okay. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=974.78s)]
*  So my sisters had a great summer. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=978.18s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=981.3s)]
*  Well, we will see. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=982.66s)]
*  That's true. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=983.7s)]
*  Um, but let me tell you something. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=984.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=986.46s)]
*  She had a great summer. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=986.78s)]
*  They did. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=988.34s)]
*  Because Caruso and Hardenstein, let me tell you something, man, they, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=989.02s)]
*  they had the best summer. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=995.54s)]
*  Well, they came, they came damn close to being Dallas. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=997.82s)]
*  I was, I was on that corner. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1000.74s)]
*  I felt, and I said this and the Dallas fans are getting mad at me, but I felt [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1002.62s)]
*  like that series came down to like two rebounds and three shots and they were [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1006.3s)]
*  even that game six when they found Washington in the corner, they just, I [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1010.78s)]
*  thought, I thought, okay, see it was close and they were two guys short and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1014.98s)]
*  they got the two guys. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1017.46s)]
*  They got the two guys too. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1018.7s)]
*  And they, they got the two role players who are probably like, that's what you [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1020.22s)]
*  want when you have stars, you want guys who are going to do the dirty work. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1026.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1029.82s)]
*  And they went out and got the best, probably two dirty work guys in the NBA. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1030.66s)]
*  Well, dirty work guys are back. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1035.74s)]
*  Cause Drew and Derek White, I feel like, I feel like now everybody [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1037.06s)]
*  knows they need the dirty work. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1040.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1041.5s)]
*  Well, yeah, because you got to understand some very few players want to play on [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1042.42s)]
*  a team where they're not going to get into shots. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1047.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1049.78s)]
*  That's the key. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1050.54s)]
*  And Derek White going to get shots because they have to stop Taylor and Brown. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1051.6999999999998s)]
*  So that's what I tell people. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1058.22s)]
*  I said, man, the dirty work guys are important because you, every team [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1059.8999999999999s)]
*  builds their team around stopping the stars. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1065.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1068.1799999999998s)]
*  And you have to make stars pass the ball and Derek White is always wide open. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1068.86s)]
*  And he, like, and what you have to do in that situation, just shake [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1075.22s)]
*  his hand when it's over. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1078.86s)]
*  So, Hey, you know what? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1080.34s)]
*  We're not going to let Brown and Tatum beat us. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1081.46s)]
*  Derek White beat us. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1083.82s)]
*  Let's just shake his hand and say anything. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1084.8999999999999s)]
*  And I'm a big true holiday fan. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1087.02s)]
*  If those guys beat us, because Tatum and Brown, they're going to get X [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1089.06s)]
*  amount of points no matter what. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1093.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1096.82s)]
*  You just can't let them go crazy. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1097.1399999999999s)]
*  You have to pick your poison as we say, Hey, let's like Derek White make these [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1099.1s)]
*  shots and Derek White made those shots and the sellers are champs. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1103.66s)]
*  Same thing for Zingas took such a load off those guys too, because he was their [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1106.6200000000001s)]
*  best defender and man, I'll tell you, there's no better three guy in the league [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1111.78s)]
*  than for Zingas when he's healthy. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1118.74s)]
*  I was just talking about him with somebody about, you know, he comes back [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1121.0600000000002s)]
*  for game five of the finals, but he's hurt and they're like, you can't make it worse. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1124.94s)]
*  But he had a real impact on game five. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1130.02s)]
*  I thought he was one of the reasons they were able to extend the lead [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1132.18s)]
*  and put Dallas away. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1134.7s)]
*  But, um, if he couldn't have played in that game, I don't, that there's an [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1136.1000000000001s)]
*  alternate universe that of that series, that I think Boston was a better team. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1140.9s)]
*  But that could have been a scary thing. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1145.54s)]
*  If all of a sudden you're going back to Dallas for game six with a three, nothing [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1147.18s)]
*  lead and, uh, you know, no poor Zingas. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1150.7s)]
*  They shoot their wild with poor Zingas and then he's out for the rest of the [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1153.8600000000001s)]
*  finals because he played the one game. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1156.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1158.78s)]
*  It was a little bit, a little more heroic than maybe he got credit [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1159.14s)]
*  for trying to play because now he's out for seven months. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1162.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1165.5s)]
*  But I think he was already hurt to be honest with you and he was going to have [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1166.0600000000002s)]
*  to have surgery no matter what, but that goes back to where we're talking about [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1170.38s)]
*  Jason Tatum and, uh, in the Olympics. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1175.1000000000001s)]
*  Yo man, just let me go out there and try, let me play so I feel like [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1178.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm part of the championship. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1183.38s)]
*  There's no doubt in my mind. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1185.18s)]
*  But Zingas like, I really only played a game and a half. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1186.42s)]
*  Let me go out here. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1190.5800000000002s)]
*  Even if let me show these guys, let me let these guys know that this means a lot to me. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1191.5400000000002s)]
*  So I was proud of him, but I think he's a good kid. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1197.9s)]
*  I think he's a heck of a player. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1201.0200000000002s)]
*  And like I said, I said before the season, I says, especially once they got drew [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1203.2600000000002s)]
*  holiday, I said, everybody has planned for second place. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1207.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1211.0600000000002s)]
*  This thing is over. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1211.3000000000002s)]
*  Everybody else plan for second place, plain and simple. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1212.9s)]
*  So when you look back at last season, as we, you know, the upcoming season [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1215.9799999999998s)]
*  isn't that far away when you look back at what happened last season, how it [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1220.9799999999998s)]
*  played out, the Celtics won pretty easily. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1224.34s)]
*  They didn't really have a ton of challenges in the four rounds. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1226.9799999999998s)]
*  There was a lot of injuries that went in their favor. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1230.34s)]
*  The West was all over the place. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1232.2199999999998s)]
*  How are you going to remember that season? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1235.1s)]
*  Cause I think even after the playoffs ended, all of us were kind of like, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1236.9399999999998s)]
*  eh, that wasn't that great of a playoffs. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1240.82s)]
*  I can't tell if it was an anomaly or, or what. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1243.46s)]
*  They had the best record in NBA. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1247.8600000000001s)]
*  They really were, uh, you know, injuries a part of the game, but they had the [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1252.18s)]
*  best record in the NBA. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1256.9s)]
*  They had the best team in my opinion. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1259.94s)]
*  I agree. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1263.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, Jason and Jaylen both were top 10 players, right? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1264.6200000000001s)]
*  True holidays, probably the most underrated player in the NBA. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1269.38s)]
*  Derek White is a terrific role player. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1274.3400000000001s)]
*  Pazingas is man. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1277.42s)]
*  You know, they call his nickname is a unicorn. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1279.74s)]
*  Like when he's healthy, his defensive, like the one game he was healthy. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1282.42s)]
*  He had like three or four blocks. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1289.74s)]
*  Game one. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1292.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1293.1000000000001s)]
*  They turned game one into, let's see how the series goes to like. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1293.9s)]
*  Damn, the Septics up 30. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1299.3000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1301.42s)]
*  I mean, they went from zero to 60 so quick. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1301.6200000000001s)]
*  It was like, he blocked three shots in the first half. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1307.0600000000002s)]
*  They probably took the whole momentum away from it even being a competitive game. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1312.38s)]
*  So, no, you gotta give those guys the flowers. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1319.94s)]
*  I think I saw a stat only like three or four teams won, I think 90 some [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1326.66s)]
*  games in the history of the NBA. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1332.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1335.7s)]
*  It was 80 plus, right? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1335.9s)]
*  Like I think their final record was like 80 and 21. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1337.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1339.98s)]
*  It's like less than 10 teams. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1340.22s)]
*  It's done three or four times. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1342.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1344.06s)]
*  And you know, you factor in, I think that Pazingas missed some games [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1345.1s)]
*  during the regular season. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1352.54s)]
*  I think Brown. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1353.86s)]
*  I think Brown, he heard his face and he missed a bunch of games. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1354.98s)]
*  So you factor all that in. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1360.58s)]
*  You're like, man, that's a really, really good team. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1363.8600000000001s)]
*  But, but let me tell you something. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1367.54s)]
*  Let me ask you this question though. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1368.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1370.06s)]
*  Would people, anybody give you bullshit about this bill? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1370.34s)]
*  You say yourself, let's look at this Celtics team. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1373.58s)]
*  Brown, Tatum, Pazingas, Drew Holliday. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1378.38s)]
*  You can throw Derek White at there. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1383.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1384.66s)]
*  It's like five of the top 50 guys. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1385.18s)]
*  Easily. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1387.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1388.46s)]
*  Easily. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1389.14s)]
*  By any, on any list. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1389.8600000000001s)]
*  On any list. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1391.5400000000002s)]
*  And first of all, you can actually stop at Brown and Tatum. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1392.78s)]
*  Who else have two, who else have two of the top 10 players in the NBA? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1397.22s)]
*  I mean, some people would say the Lakers. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1403.26s)]
*  No. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1405.5s)]
*  Well, listen, I think the difference is- [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1405.94s)]
*  Hey, let me tell you something. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1408.7s)]
*  That's, go back to our original conversation. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1411.02s)]
*  That's TV talk. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1413.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1415.14s)]
*  Because no other top 10, two players in the top 10, go be in the play-in [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1415.74s)]
*  bullshit. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1421.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1421.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1423.18s)]
*  Let's just think about that. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1423.42s)]
*  Or miss the playoffs. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1424.02s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1424.98s)]
*  No, no. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1425.5800000000002s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1426.14s)]
*  The, the play-in has been great for the NBA, but it's not even a real thing. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1427.8200000000002s)]
*  So don't tell me they got two of the top 10 players then, then an imaginary [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1432.5400000000002s)]
*  playoffs. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1437.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they wouldn't have made it to playoffs if we had, if we didn't add [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1438.38s)]
*  teams to the playoffs. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1443.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1444.78s)]
*  I don't really want to hear that of that. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1445.42s)]
*  Cause action, the scoreboard speaks for itself. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1448.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1452.14s)]
*  It's almost like there's two different versions of what makes a list like that. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1452.5400000000002s)]
*  The best players. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1456.78s)]
*  Cause I do think LeBron, if it's like, you know, a playing game, if it's the [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1457.5400000000002s)]
*  Olympics, if it's the in-season tournament, if he can ramp it up for a week, he is [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1462.46s)]
*  one of the 10 best players, but I always feel like we discount durability and [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1467.8600000000001s)]
*  reliability during the course of regular season, like LeBron can't really play [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1473.02s)]
*  even 60 games a year anymore. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1476.58s)]
*  Like he's got to pick his spots and he's old, you know, and that the Tatum Brown [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1478.34s)]
*  thing, I always thought, I always thought that was the thing they never got credit [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1482.98s)]
*  for is like day in, day out, week in, week out. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1486.3s)]
*  Those guys are playing big minutes, big responsibilities, guarding the best [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1488.94s)]
*  guys in the other team. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1492.42s)]
*  Then they're going into the playoffs, playing three, four rounds, a hundred [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1493.74s)]
*  game seasons, and they're playing 90% of them, which, you know, not even Yannis [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1497.7s)]
*  hasn't been able to do that consistently the last couple of years. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1502.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1505.3s)]
*  And like I say, that's why I think man, get those guys their [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1505.54s)]
*  flowers, what they accomplished. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1508.58s)]
*  And I don't want to hear about who was hurt on the other team. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1510.26s)]
*  Let's be real. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1515.1399999999999s)]
*  Cause we have that every year. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1515.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1517.26s)]
*  But let me tell you something though. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1517.5s)]
*  There's not one injury that you could mention and you say, Oh, that [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1519.62s)]
*  team would have beat the Celtics. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1525.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1527.1s)]
*  If you're going to be fair, anybody who's having this conversation, you can't say [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1528.4199999999998s)]
*  to yourself, well, this team had a hat. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1533.74s)]
*  This guy, man, they weren't going to beat the Celtics. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1536.1s)]
*  They were not going to beat the Celtics. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1539.02s)]
*  This year's going to be harder because I think, okay, see loaded up. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1541.22s)]
*  Dallas got a taste of it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1545.58s)]
*  The West is better. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1546.9399999999998s)]
*  The West is going to be deep night after night after night. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1547.8999999999999s)]
*  Milwaukee is going to be motivated. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1550.6999999999998s)]
*  Philly's back. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1552.3799999999999s)]
*  The Knicks are better. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1553.22s)]
*  And it reminds me a little that 93 season you were in that first year you were in [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1554.8200000000002s)]
*  Phoenix when just, it seemed like everybody was good and it was like, Holy shit. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1558.98s)]
*  I could see like 10 teams winning the title. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1563.7s)]
*  I do feel like the talent level is, is at that level again. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1566.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1569.8600000000001s)]
*  But listen, the Knicks are going to miss Hardenstein. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1570.38s)]
*  No question. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1577.42s)]
*  And they got to figure out the rando piece too. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1578.22s)]
*  Like who were their best five at the end of the games? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1579.98s)]
*  They got to figure that's a really big piece. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1582.46s)]
*  That's a great point on your point, but the Joel on be Paul George scenario. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1584.18s)]
*  That's going to be fascinating to watch because I still think it's between them. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1592.6200000000001s)]
*  And the Celtics, because let's get one thing straight. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1598.58s)]
*  Y'all can talk. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1602.1s)]
*  These people can talk all they want to about the Knicks. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1603.1s)]
*  I says the Knicks cannot beat the Pacers. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1606.5s)]
*  And they didn't. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1609.66s)]
*  I says, cause when I'm watching these games, I'm looking for a matchup. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1611.42s)]
*  I says, yo man, the Knicks are tough. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1615.22s)]
*  I love Bronson, but they can't beat the Pacers. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1617.46s)]
*  I said, and they didn't. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1621.3s)]
*  And so I think you have to really be like, man, can anybody catch the Celtics? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1624.18s)]
*  And there was question marks on the Sixers. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1631.58s)]
*  Uh, I love what they've done. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1635.3s)]
*  I root for the Sixers, but let's be realistic. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1637.9399999999998s)]
*  We're chasing the Celtics. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1641.54s)]
*  Now you're pulling on the Western conference. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1643.2199999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1647.3799999999999s)]
*  See, I think got better. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1647.78s)]
*  The math, I think are going to regress design situation in New Orleans. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1651.3799999999999s)]
*  Can he get himself in shape? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1659.62s)]
*  They could be. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1661.6999999999998s)]
*  Year five of that conversation. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1662.78s)]
*  I know we got to sit back and wait. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1665.02s)]
*  Um, Phoenix, my sons, they got no identity and no leadership. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1668.5s)]
*  Um, but they did get better. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1678.6599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1681.54s)]
*  I mean, the Tyus Jones thing, just getting him basically for free was, was nice. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1682.1799999999998s)]
*  They needed a point guard and they have a, and the coach I think is going [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1686.74s)]
*  to be good for them too. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1690.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but you still gotta have leadership on your team. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1691.58s)]
*  Bill, you gotta have a style of play. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1694.7s)]
*  You gotta have leadership. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1697.54s)]
*  The sons have not proven they can do that yet. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1698.66s)]
*  Well, so what do we make a Devin Booker at this point in his career then? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1702.3s)]
*  Cause I think we all feel like he's one of the best 10 to 15 guys. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1705.98s)]
*  He's a terrific player. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1709.1000000000001s)]
*  He was perfect on team USA. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1711.06s)]
*  He's been, he's been the best player in a finals team. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1713.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1716.06s)]
*  That was three years ago. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1716.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1717.8600000000001s)]
*  But the whole dynamic of the team changed when Katie and Bill came there. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1718.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1724.5s)]
*  You know, so, so now they gotta have leadership. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1725.46s)]
*  He's got to take the leadership role because I think he's reluctant because [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1728.26s)]
*  people assume that Katie's the best player. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1732.8200000000002s)]
*  I said, but your best player don't have to, Kevin, Kevin has said he [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1735.5800000000002s)]
*  doesn't want to be a leader. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1738.5s)]
*  He just want to play basketball. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1739.5s)]
*  And I challenged Booker last year and they got mad. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1741.7s)]
*  I said, sons don't have any leadership. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1744.8200000000002s)]
*  They don't have a style of play. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1746.7s)]
*  And they got mad, which I don't care. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1748.8600000000001s)]
*  Uh, but I said, it's gotta be Booker. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1751.3000000000002s)]
*  He's going to take a serious leadership role because people [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1753.54s)]
*  got to happen. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1756.3000000000002s)]
*  People gonna, people gonna listen to him because he's a great player, but [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1757.94s)]
*  he's got to become more of a leader. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1762.22s)]
*  Got to be more of a vocal leader. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1763.54s)]
*  And then we're going to see what happened with the sons. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1765.3400000000001s)]
*  Uh, but man, we didn't mention Minnesota and we didn't mention a big [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1767.9s)]
*  joker, by the way, who almost beat team USA by himself for the bunch of [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1771.5800000000002s)]
*  you guys, nobody had ever heard of. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1774.78s)]
*  He did, but they got to get some, they got to get some bench. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1776.5800000000002s)]
*  I liked him going out and getting Westbrook's, but that team wore down [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1779.3400000000001s)]
*  because they didn't do anything to replace the bench players. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1782.82s)]
*  They let everybody go after they won the championship. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1786.4199999999998s)]
*  Uh, Minnesota, I think will regress. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1789.78s)]
*  Oh, you're giving them the will regress. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1792.86s)]
*  They will regress. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1794.98s)]
*  They got lucky last year. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1796.34s)]
*  Everything worked out for them. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1797.54s)]
*  They let the joker down last year because he had to play the whole game [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1800.3799999999999s)]
*  against those two big seven footers. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1804.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1806.8999999999999s)]
*  And he just got worn down. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1807.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1809.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't think they're going to let that happen. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1809.82s)]
*  Like I said, I love the fact that went out and got Westbrook, but they [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1811.38s)]
*  still need another big body. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1814.6200000000001s)]
*  Uh, it's one team I mentioned that you said we said we have Minnesota, Denver, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1817.3000000000002s)]
*  I guess the Clippers you could, no, I can't count on them ever. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1822.22s)]
*  Golden state. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1827.14s)]
*  We're saying no Lakers. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1827.8600000000001s)]
*  No thanks. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1829.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1830.66s)]
*  And we probably miss it, but that's the point. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1831.98s)]
*  There's so many teams in the, yeah, I'm trying to think that one team I've got. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1833.5800000000002s)]
*  I said, I'm curious to see how they're going to do. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1836.98s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1838.82s)]
*  You're not, you're not interested in Milwaukee at all. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1839.34s)]
*  Huh? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1841.98s)]
*  You just feel like that runs over. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1842.34s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1843.9399999999998s)]
*  Uh, we think they're too old other than Yanis. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1845.4199999999998s)]
*  I think that Yanis has to get better as a basketball player. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1849.82s)]
*  Well, he's training with Drew Hanlon this year, apparently. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1854.62s)]
*  But that's just going downhill one on five. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1857.02s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1860.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1861.6599999999999s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1862.3s)]
*  Uh, and he's a terrific player and terrific kid, but he's got to get [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1863.9399999999998s)]
*  better as a basketball player. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1867.26s)]
*  Uh, so no, I'm not, I'm not a Milwaukee guy. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1869.86s)]
*  Uh, I will, if I don't tell doc, yeah, I'm trying to think I miss somebody [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1874.42s)]
*  in the West, I can't think of who that is. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1881.7s)]
*  I'm going to look it up as you're talking, but answer me this question. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1884.02s)]
*  Cause I was, I was thinking about this. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1887.62s)]
*  I was trying to get to the point mentally where I love basketball the most, as [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1889.14s)]
*  you know, it's my favorite sport, but I found myself looking forward to the [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1893.94s)]
*  football season more than I look forward to basketball season. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1897.7s)]
*  There's a reason for that right? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1901.02s)]
*  That let me know you got some issues because let me tell you something. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1902.26s)]
*  There's nothing better than pro football and college football. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=1907.8200000000002s)]

*  this stupid conversation they were having. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2096.7000000000003s)]
*  No, this, this infrastructure we've created in the NBA where if somebody doesn't [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2099.1000000000004s)]
*  win the title, they might go and there's trade rumors and, Oh, this contract's up [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2103.0600000000004s)]
*  in two years. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2107.82s)]
*  And I was thinking about some of the guys in football that we were in [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2108.98s)]
*  quarterbacks, don't really switch teams ever, which I think is a real strength [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2111.5800000000004s)]
*  for football. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2114.9s)]

*  If somebody was in this situation, Dak Prescott's been in for the last two [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2126.42s)]
*  years, where it's like, yeah, I don't know. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2129.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you're going to get an extension or not. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2132.3s)]
*  This would be covered every day. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2134.26s)]
*  Like step, he'd probably demand a trade. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2136.1400000000003s)]
*  Same thing for like Josh Allen on Buffalo losing all his receivers. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2138.86s)]
*  It was like, I don't know if I can stay here. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2142.82s)]
*  No, hold on. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2144.46s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2147.5s)]
*  Because I understand the Cowboys perspectives. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2148.38s)]
*  They have one jack shit with them. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2152.38s)]
*  And so they made him the highest paid quarterback, like three, four years ago. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2154.9s)]
*  Correct. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2160.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2161.46s)]
*  So now they got to make him a high speed quarterback again. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2163.54s)]
*  And said one playoff win, I think. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2167.82s)]
*  And I'm like, well, everybody's acting like they're being disrespectful to that. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2169.34s)]
*  They made him the highest paid football player in the world, like four years ago [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2175.58s)]
*  when they have, cause let me tell you something, that game last year was [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2179.02s)]
*  concerning to me because the Green Bay game, if you are a serious football team, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2182.38s)]
*  you can't get blown out like that at home. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2191.38s)]
*  48 to 32 at home. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2195.14s)]
*  You can, and you down 28 zip in the second quarter because you ain't made to [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2197.22s)]
*  play, you ain't been a relevant team. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2202.66s)]
*  You get a home game, a home game. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2205.22s)]
*  I think you got to win that game. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2208.54s)]
*  I've said this before. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2210.54s)]
*  You don't have to win the game, but you can't get blown out like that. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2212.26s)]
*  That was, that was a Scarlet letter as they say. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2216.54s)]
*  I'm like, cause I'm sitting there watching that game and I'm a tatered tree, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2220.26s)]
*  but I obviously bet on Dallas. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2223.82s)]
*  I'm like, there's no way Dallas is going to lose this first home game. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2225.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2230.46s)]
*  Against a, a really a rookie quarterback, basically in love. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2230.86s)]
*  Coming on the road, Cowboys, you know, they've been talking. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2235.7400000000002s)]

*  Okay. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2246.98s)]
*  To have an upstart come to your house and be down 28 zip. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2248.14s)]

*  This is bad. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2257.5s)]
*  I can say they don't have to win the game, but you, you can't get beat like that. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2258.46s)]
*  That's that's player and coaching blame right there. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2263.94s)]
*  But they brought the coach back and they brought the quarterback back. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2268.7s)]
*  Yeah, because they can't, because this, this is a last year. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2271.98s)]
*  This is the last year's Panamera. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2275.58s)]

*  The problem though. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2304.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2305.1800000000003s)]
*  The problem is because they didn't give them a new contract. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2305.38s)]
*  All that money hits them this year, which made it harder for them to make the [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2308.26s)]
*  team bad. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2311.22s)]
*  So your theory is they should make him the house paid again. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2312.06s)]
*  No, my theory is they've won nothing with DAC and they should probably let him go. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2317.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm more interested in the NBA prism of it because we've seen this in the NBA [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2322.7s)]
*  with like Zach Levine, Bradley Beal, some of the guys that got max extensions [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2326.14s)]
*  this year where people are like, well, I guess we got to do it and you're doing [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2331.66s)]
*  it and you don't know if this is a path to even make like round two of the [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2334.58s)]
*  playoffs, right? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2338.8199999999997s)]
*  But in the NBA, it's like, if you don't do it also, now you had dissension. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2339.98s)]
*  Got, got, not sure if the guy's happy and we're just, we've so much movement in [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2343.7799999999997s)]
*  the league now and we're so used to it. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2348.58s)]
*  And it's such a part of the dialogue that I actually think it's really bad. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2350.22s)]
*  Oh, well, first of all, I think it's, I think it's always been bad. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2354.66s)]
*  This is the worst it's ever been. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2358.7799999999997s)]
*  Come on. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2360.4199999999996s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2360.7799999999997s)]
*  Cause I've said this, I'm not just saying it cause I'm on your podcast. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2362.54s)]
*  I don't understand why bad teams have to pay bad players. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2366.02s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2370.66s)]
*  I, cause like, well, wait a minute. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2371.98s)]
*  If I give a guy $50 million a year and he's just a good player, I'm stuck with [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2374.46s)]
*  him and we're stuck losing in the first round of the playoffs. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2379.7s)]
*  I've always said that I was like, wait a minute. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2383.98s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to pay Brown and pay the max dollars. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2387.1s)]
*  I'm not playing anybody for the hall. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2392.02s)]
*  Um, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2394.98s)]
*  well, like Lamila ball's a good example, right? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2396.14s)]
*  They gave him that extension right away. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2398.14s)]
*  And I don't even think they won 30 games. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2399.8199999999997s)]
*  I really don't understand why we have to play. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2402.06s)]
*  First of all, everybody in NBA can play. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2404.98s)]
*  Let me get that out the way. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2406.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2408.1s)]
*  But why am I paying a guy who's just a good player, $50 million a year for five [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2408.94s)]
*  years, I can't trade him. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2414.58s)]
*  We're not going to get better. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2417.3799999999997s)]
*  I've never understood that. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=2419.7799999999997s)]

*  He's the only reason they're in the finals. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3041.3s)]
*  Is he a great, I'll tell you, I was fucking terrified every time he had the [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3042.94s)]
*  ball or took a shot, like he is a 10 out of 10 when you're rooting against his [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3046.3s)]
*  team, I'm terrified of him the whole time. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3051.1s)]
*  I do think he needs to get in better shape on the one hand, but on the other [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3053.22s)]
*  hand, maybe this is the right shape for him because he's so fucking big. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3055.86s)]
*  He can bully ball everybody. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3060.06s)]
*  Well, I think he needs to get in better shape, but he, he's the only reason, no [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3061.78s)]
*  disrespect to Kyrie, but he's the reason they were in the finals. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3067.1s)]
*  But I love, I love the fact how quick these talking heads turn on these [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3070.3s)]
*  players, cause like I say, the week before we were bragging, I, man, this [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3075.14s)]
*  look a dungeon. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3080.9s)]
*  Is he the next great player? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3081.6600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3083.6200000000003s)]
*  Is he going to grab the torch? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3083.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3085.26s)]
*  I did that podcast. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3086.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3087.98s)]
*  Cause like, but like two weeks before this, how foolish people in our [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3088.1800000000003s)]
*  business are bill like the week before Michael Jordan is re-incorporated when [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3092.86s)]
*  the athlete on they were sweeping the sides, he's done on KD and everything. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3098.38s)]
*  They're like, this guy, Anthony, I was like, yo man, please stop. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3101.94s)]
*  I love Anthony Edwards. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3106.02s)]
*  He's not freaking Michael Jordan. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3107.1800000000003s)]
*  Please stop. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3108.6200000000003s)]
*  Please stop. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3109.34s)]
*  Then they get beat by the, by the mouth and they're like, he cooled off. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3110.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3115.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3115.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3116.58s)]
*  What are we seeing in Luka Dantzik? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3117.78s)]
*  What are we seeing? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3119.7s)]
*  And then when the Celtics who had a much better team go up three zip, Luka [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3121.86s)]
*  Dantzik don't play any defense. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3128.86s)]
*  He's the reason I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3130.54s)]
*  Y'all went from he's the second reincarnation of bird and somebody else [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3132.42s)]
*  combined, but that's the thing I hate about our business, man. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3136.22s)]
*  There's a lot of, a lot of guys out there with they turn quickly. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3139.86s)]
*  A Luka Dantzik is the only reason they were in the finals period. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3143.42s)]
*  You know, the Anthony Edwards Jordan thing. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3148.58s)]
*  And I was trying to be, as you know, I'm, I'm always going to be in the Jordans. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3150.58s)]
*  The best player I've ever seen camp unless until somebody passes them. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3154.06s)]
*  And for me, it hasn't happened yet, but it hasn't happened yet. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3157.26s)]
*  There were flashes of Edwards and I'm sure you felt it too. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3163.02s)]
*  And you even got to play against Jordan. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3166.42s)]
*  He had some moments in those first two rounds where it was like, Oh, yeah, that [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3168.18s)]
*  yeah, that there's glimpses and Kobe young Kobe had the same thing. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3172.7s)]
*  There was some Kobe moments where it was like, Oh, but we're never seen another [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3176.8599999999997s)]
*  Jordan. I think what's interesting about Edwards for me and, and now I'm not just [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3180.66s)]
*  saying this because you're on the pod. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3185.5s)]
*  He has such like a life and a positive energy and such a great personality that [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3187.3799999999997s)]
*  it reminds me of when you came in, in the mid eighties and everybody was like, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3193.3799999999997s)]
*  you know, who's a really good interview Charles Barkley. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3197.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, you know, who's really fun. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3199.86s)]
*  And the personality started to become part of the package for you. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3201.42s)]
*  And I think that to me, like the league needs somebody like him. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3206.3s)]
*  That is just, I just think he's this enchanting guy. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3210.1s)]
*  You could feel it in the Olympics. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3213.1400000000003s)]
*  He was like in the middle of everything. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3214.38s)]
*  Well, I think that not pat myself on the back. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3216.3s)]
*  And I think Anthony, when I've seen the old man, we're just basketball players. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3219.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3224.86s)]
*  We're not, we're not teachers. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3225.1s)]
*  We're not firemen. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3227.2999999999997s)]
*  We're not policemen. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3228.22s)]
*  We make it a ridiculous amount of money. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3229.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm getting paid millions of dollars to play a stupid ass game. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3232.3399999999997s)]
*  I've always known that. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3235.42s)]
*  And I think Anthony knows that I think Yannis practices that also. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3237.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3244.06s)]
*  But you know what, you know what Edwards has though? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3244.18s)]
*  There, there's an authenticity to him that I think is harder and harder to find in [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3245.7799999999997s)]
*  sports in 2024 when everything is so managed. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3250.8199999999997s)]
*  Everybody has a team. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3253.58s)]
*  Every, every decision is made with such a purpose publicly. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3254.86s)]
*  And you were never like that. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3258.7s)]
*  You're just like, here's what I think. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3259.74s)]
*  And then the same way is like, here's what I think. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3261.34s)]
*  Here's what I think. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3263.62s)]
*  I'm going to be, cause what happened to me? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3264.9s)]
*  I have a turning point in Philadelphia because, you know, first of all, everybody [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3266.82s)]
*  wants to be liked and about Terry. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3271.14s)]
*  I love my head guys. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3273.86s)]
*  Two things that drive me crazy about players. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3275.58s)]
*  Uh, uh, I don't watch television or read the newspapers. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3277.98s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3281.74s)]
*  Of course you watch television and read the newspaper. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3282.82s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3286.9s)]
*  Are you just sitting in your house in the dark the whole time? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3287.6200000000003s)]
*  Please stop there. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3289.98s)]
*  Also, they're trapped in a hotel room or their place out there. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3291.02s)]
*  Cause they're fucking famous. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3293.5800000000004s)]
*  They can't go anywhere. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3294.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, you know what's even worse? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3296.02s)]
*  They mom and dad, they supposed to, they wife, their girlfriend, all fucking [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3297.9s)]
*  tell them when they hear somebody say something about them. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3301.42s)]
*  So shut the fuck up, tell them you don't pay attention. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3303.94s)]
*  But my second thing is I don't care what other people think. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3306.98s)]
*  Everybody cares what other people think. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3309.78s)]
*  But they have to be fair. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3311.98s)]
*  So for me, it was my second year in the league. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3313.7000000000003s)]
*  I had to sit down with Dr. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3317.1800000000003s)]
*  J. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3318.46s)]
*  I said, doc, I'm getting some, some of the stuff I'm saying. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3318.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm getting some blowback. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3324.0600000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3325.7400000000002s)]
*  So we sit down. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3326.42s)]
*  He says, son, what are you asking me? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3327.46s)]
*  I said, man, I want everybody to like me. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3330.3s)]
*  He looked at me. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3331.98s)]
*  He says, oh yeah, you're just wasting your time. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3332.42s)]
*  Trying to, it doesn't matter what you say. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3335.6600000000003s)]
*  Everybody's not going to like you. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3337.82s)]
*  You're going to have to make a decision whether you're just going to be a straight [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3339.82s)]
*  shooter and they still going to hate you half the time anyway, but you can't play [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3342.62s)]
*  volleyball with your opinions. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3348.18s)]
*  You can't be trying to say something to please this group and get over here and [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3350.06s)]
*  say something about this group. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3353.54s)]
*  And I said, so if I just be straight honest, he says, that's the best way to be, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3355.7400000000002s)]
*  but you're going to get blowback on that anyway. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3360.42s)]
*  So Bill, that's when I made up my mind. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3363.06s)]
*  I'm like, Hey, you know what? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3364.98s)]
*  I cannot make all these people happy. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3366.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3368.7s)]
*  I'm going to hate me and have them don't like me or whatever. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3368.9s)]
*  And I said, I'm going to just tell the truth and let the chips fall. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3372.3s)]
*  What they made. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3374.98s)]
*  Well, you made a lot of tape recorders happy. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3376.2200000000003s)]
*  That can be recorded is these guys have a job to do. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3378.7000000000003s)]
*  I've always understood. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3383.7000000000003s)]
*  See, this one thing I hate about players. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3385.38s)]
*  They want all the money and all the accolades and all the stuff that goes with this, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3388.46s)]
*  but they don't want any other responsibility. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3394.62s)]
*  I'm like, yo man, you sign autographs, you take pictures, you talk to the press. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3396.7s)]
*  All that bullshit goes with being rich and famous. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3404.22s)]
*  You don't get to not, yeah. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3408.5s)]
*  People are going to interrupt you at dinner sometime. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3409.74s)]
*  You reporters going to run to you. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3413.02s)]
*  And this is another thing that drives me crazy. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3415.46s)]
*  They run to the reports when they have a good game or things going good. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3417.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3421.5s)]
*  And then, then they, when they have a bad game, they want to be smug with the press, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3421.78s)]
*  give you one word answers. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3427.3s)]
*  I'm like, nah, man, you don't get to get your cake and eat it too. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3428.86s)]
*  Most of the reporters I've ever met have been great people. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3432.5s)]
*  They got a job to do. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3435.94s)]
*  When I played great, they wrote great things about me. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3437.86s)]
*  When I didn't play great, they wrote some criticism. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3441.3s)]
*  And the first thing Dr. J, after we had that conversation, he says, the first thing you [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3444.7000000000003s)]
*  have to ask yourself about criticism, is it fair? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3449.3s)]
*  He says, before you get mad at that reporter or something like that, look in the mirror [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3452.78s)]
*  and says, was the criticism fair? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3458.94s)]
*  And sometimes it was, and sometimes it wasn't. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3461.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3466.02s)]
*  I remember in the late seventies, Dr. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3466.2200000000003s)]
*  J took a ton of shit because remember he was coming in the league and people were like, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3468.94s)]
*  this guy's going to be amazing. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3473.38s)]
*  He's going to revolutionize basketball. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3474.78s)]
*  And then the Sixers, they lost in the finals. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3476.94s)]
*  Then the next two years, his knees were hurting. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3478.94s)]
*  He wasn't doing that well. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3481.38s)]
*  And this was a theme for two years, but nobody that we didn't have the same media [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3482.9s)]
*  infrastructure back then, but it was a lot of what's wrong with Dr. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3486.26s)]
*  J. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3488.78s)]
*  There's sports illustrated pieces about it. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3489.42s)]
*  Now that stuff's like a hundred times bigger. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3491.6600000000003s)]
*  The stuff that happened to you in Philly in the, in the early nineties in the social [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3494.34s)]
*  media era would be so much bigger now. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3498.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3501.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, it was very, it was crazy because I had to hear about me getting traded my [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3501.46s)]
*  last three years in Philly. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3507.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3509.78s)]
*  And it was stressful. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3511.3s)]
*  Like that was just the sport news came out with a, a cover. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3514.3s)]
*  It had me in like eight different jerseys and it was wearing on me. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3520.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3526.94s)]
*  But I'll tell you a funny story. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3528.7400000000002s)]
*  So I get arrested in Milwaukee my last year in Philly. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3531.6600000000003s)]
*  Is that the window incident? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3539.14s)]
*  No, that was Florida. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3540.58s)]
*  These three weightlifters accosted me. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3542.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3544.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3545.54s)]
*  So I get arrested. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3546.5s)]
*  So I'm in, I'm in Milwaukee on trial. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3547.74s)]
*  You were on trial. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3554.8999999999996s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3555.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3557.1s)]
*  I was on trial. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3557.3799999999997s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3558.14s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3558.58s)]
*  So. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3560.1s)]
*  It's like you and OJ. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3561.1s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3562.8999999999996s)]
*  I didn't kill people. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3564.2599999999998s)]
*  So I, I spent every day with my lawyers obviously in court, but at night we would sit around. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3565.74s)]
*  I made my mind like, let's work on this letter to the Sixers. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3572.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3576.74s)]
*  I'm not fucking coming back. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3577.06s)]
*  I'd have too much baggage, too much baggage. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3580.7s)]
*  So we spend all weeks writing this letter. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3584.14s)]
*  Cause I said, Hey, I don't want the fans involved. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3590.7s)]
*  You guys, hell is how you want to. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3594.74s)]
*  I want to thank y'all for eight great years. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3597.9799999999996s)]
*  It's been incredible. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3600.54s)]
*  Philadelphia has always treated me great. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3601.4599999999996s)]
*  It always be a special place in my heart. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3602.9399999999996s)]
*  I had this beautiful letter written and I would like to keep this private because I [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3604.8999999999996s)]
*  don't want the fans to think I just had enough of y'all. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3609.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3613.5s)]
*  I had enough of their organization. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3613.8199999999997s)]
*  And so I get acquitted on a Friday. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3615.42s)]
*  I fly back to Philly about a whole plane drinks. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3624.1s)]
*  I'm on cloud nine. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3629.38s)]
*  Me and my boys go out Friday night, celebrate. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3630.54s)]
*  We get drunk Saturday night. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3633.98s)]
*  We get drunk Sunday. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3636.94s)]
*  I'm on the phone with my agent and my attorney. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3639.02s)]
*  Send this shit out. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3642.9399999999996s)]
*  First thing Monday morning. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3644.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3647.7s)]
*  Two hours later, I get a phone call from the six that I've been [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3651.66s)]
*  traded to the Phoenix Suns and man, the whole world is lifted off my shoulders. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3657.54s)]
*  The whole, I felt it was crazy, Bill. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3667.74s)]
*  I was so ecstatic. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3671.58s)]
*  I called my friends. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3674.82s)]
*  I was like, Hey, let her go on out tomorrow. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3676.18s)]
*  Then I called my no need for the letter. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3678.18s)]
*  What happened? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3680.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3680.58s)]
*  What happened? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3680.78s)]
*  I just got treated to the Phoenix Suns and man, we went out and had some of the [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3681.54s)]
*  best alcohol I think I've ever had in my life. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3687.2200000000003s)]
*  We celebrated and the next day I was on a flight to Phoenix. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3691.46s)]
*  So do you identify at all when some of these players get unhappy? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3696.86s)]
*  I mean, the unhappy thing is much faster now. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3701.1800000000003s)]
*  Somebody could go to a new team and be unhappy at 18 months. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3703.86s)]
*  That's called the assholes in the media. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3706.58s)]
*  They've made it seem like if you don't win the championship, you're a bomb [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3709.86s)]
*  or it's the end of the world. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3716.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3718.1000000000004s)]
*  Like the reason Michael will always be my goat is he went through all those [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3718.34s)]
*  struggles. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3723.26s)]
*  Yep. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3724.46s)]
*  I look at all these other guys, like as much as I love LeBron, he lost one time. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3724.66s)]
*  He went to the finals, but he lost to the Celtics. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3731.5s)]
*  Like, no, I'm gone. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3734.94s)]
*  Like, yeah, you're supposed to win a champion. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3736.7s)]
*  It's supposed to be hard to win the championship. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3739.02s)]
*  We did in 14 too. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3741.3399999999997s)]
*  That was leaving Miami. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3742.62s)]
*  Now, maybe that was the plan to leave Miami. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3744.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3746.46s)]
*  But I was like, Yo, man, it's supposed to be hard. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3746.62s)]
*  I saw the same thing. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3751.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the same thing with KD. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3752.9799999999996s)]
*  Like, nah, I do. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3755.62s)]
*  You, you ain't supposed to, it's supposed to be hard to win the championship. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3758.2599999999998s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3762.5s)]
*  That's why I brought up the football example before about like somebody like Josh [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3763.22s)]
*  Allen, who hasn't even been in the Superbowl, right? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3766.9399999999996s)]
*  And he's been there for a while. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3769.2599999999998s)]
*  He's one of the best players. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3770.22s)]
*  He ain't there. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3771.18s)]
*  See, first of all, I'm so glad you bought this football stuff up. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3771.7s)]
*  I want to say something that's really pissing me off. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3776.3399999999997s)]
*  I have enough of this Belichick slander. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3778.54s)]
*  I've had enough. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3783.18s)]
*  Now you're preaching the choir. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3784.46s)]
*  I'm going to tell you guys something. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3786.02s)]

*  overrated Josh Allen was. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3881.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3884.7799999999997s)]

*  They're talking about nobody can beat Pat Mahomes. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3893.06s)]
*  That football game, well, they got down the field and won an overtime. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3896.22s)]
*  It's 13 seconds. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3901.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3902.66s)]
*  Best football game I've ever seen. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3903.06s)]
*  That's not Josh Allen fault. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3904.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3906.7s)]
*  And even last year, they almost beat him. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3907.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, it's Josh Allen fault. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3910.98s)]
*  They missed the field goal that would have took the game probably in the overtime. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3913.46s)]
*  And these guys get on TV talking about Josh Allen's overrated. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3917.98s)]
*  And Damian Woody says, I'm not having any more of this Josh Allen slander. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3921.5s)]
*  He's played as well as he could against Mahomes both times and [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3925.18s)]
*  neither time he lost was his fault. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3928.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3930.3799999999997s)]

*  It's you guys are entitled to their opinion, but you have to be fair. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3937.66s)]
*  Because people believe what we say on television. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3944.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3948.7s)]

*  Bill Belichick is the greatest football coach ever in the pros. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=3952.58s)]

*  This girl is incredible. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4007.1800000000003s)]
*  What she did in college for women's basketball. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4010.06s)]
*  What she's doing in a WNBA. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4013.7799999999997s)]
*  She turned the fever were one and eight. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4015.94s)]
*  They have a winning record now. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4018.06s)]
*  But the number of attention eyeballs she's bought the cards and the pros. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4020.22s)]
*  And for these women to have this petty jealousness, you say to yourself, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4026.2599999999998s)]
*  damn, what is going on here? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4032.1s)]
*  And well, you got accused of that stuff too, with the older players being [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4035.46s)]
*  resentful of the new generation. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4039.3399999999997s)]
*  It's kind of part of the basketball process. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4041.8599999999997s)]
*  Everybody thinks their generation is the best. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4043.8599999999997s)]
*  No, no. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4045.98s)]
*  Anytime we say something about guys, it ain't the old get off my long guy. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4047.2999999999997s)]

*  And the thing I love about her, she never says a word. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4056.98s)]
*  She never says a word. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4061.7400000000002s)]
*  And now when I watch her, two things I like, she's playing much faster. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4064.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4070.34s)]
*  Much faster. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4071.1400000000003s)]
*  She was playing too slow the first half of the season. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4071.98s)]
*  She, she thought it was tired. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4074.98s)]
*  I think she was banged up from the college season. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4076.78s)]
*  They didn't even give her the understanding. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4078.98s)]
*  Like you girls been rewarded for the WNBA season. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4082.06s)]
*  Y'all been working out on the no. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4086.86s)]
*  She came straight out of college. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4089.5s)]
*  You had to go right to the WNBA like two weeks later. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4090.94s)]
*  So they didn't even practice there. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4093.98s)]
*  But I think when I watched her play the last month, I think she's [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4096.1s)]
*  learning to play much faster because I think she's learning to trust those [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4102.58s)]
*  girls more because she's in college. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4105.66s)]
*  She's not passing to a bunch of great players. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4109.06s)]
*  Now you can see when she plays, she's playing a lot without the ball. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4111.3s)]
*  She's minding me a lot of Jason Kidd. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4114.26s)]
*  Jason Kidd is the best I've ever seen with playing without the basketball. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4116.54s)]
*  I played with Jason Kidd one time in an all-star game. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4120.38s)]
*  He says, you know, you should be getting like six to eight points a game more. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4122.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4127.139999999999s)]
*  I was, what are you talking about? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4127.54s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4130.78s)]
*  He says, your point guards wait and give you the ball too late. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4131.0199999999995s)]
*  If I give you the ball full speed ahead, instead of waiting through to finish, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4135.5s)]
*  you get another eight to 10 points a game. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4140.179999999999s)]
*  She's starting to see now if I play faster and give it to them sooner. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4142.66s)]
*  So that tells me she's really smart. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4146.66s)]
*  But these ladies who I love and respect their game, they couldn't have [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4148.9400000000005s)]

*  Connecticut sons having a great year to Memphis. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4163.7s)]
*  Minnesota links is having a great year, but that's been so much negativity. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4166.62s)]

*  Given her that time off has given her a chance to recharge her batteries. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4188.02s)]
*  I, so it ended up, she probably did deserve to make the Olympic team on merit, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4194.5s)]
*  but her getting that time off probably was the best thing happened to her. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4200.58s)]
*  Well, the other thing that happened, her teammates, you can see like a little [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4205.9800000000005s)]
*  osmosis, you watch that team now and they're pretty unselfish to watch. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4210.660000000001s)]
*  Like they're making extra passes and it's the kind of stuff that happens [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4214.860000000001s)]
*  when you're playing with a great player. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4218.580000000001s)]
*  Well, but some of that is her fault. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4220.22s)]
*  But some of that's her fault Bill, because she's like I say, she, I think [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4222.820000000001s)]
*  she had one other girl on our team who made it to the WNBA, but she's [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4228.580000000001s)]
*  learning now I can play without the ball. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4232.94s)]
*  That goes back to, remember when Tex Winner, it says Michael. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4237.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, the triangle. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4242.94s)]
*  You have to trust these other guys. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4244.179999999999s)]
*  Cause first of all, it's going to make it easier on you playing without the ball. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4246.34s)]
*  It's much easier. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4249.9s)]
*  Like for me, I can use myself as an example, not that it's about me. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4251.26s)]
*  When I got traded to Phoenix and they gave me Dan Marley, Kevin Johnson, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4256.5s)]
*  Seth Savallo and those guys, man, it goes back to the stuff I told you about the [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4262.46s)]
*  Olympics, man, it was just so easy for me to play basketball because I didn't [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4267.54s)]
*  have to make every pass. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4272.86s)]
*  I didn't have to score every basket. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4274.82s)]
*  And I think Caitlin is learning that now. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4277.1s)]
*  Like, Oh, I can trust her. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4278.9400000000005s)]
*  I can trust her. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4280.22s)]
*  I can trust her. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4281.06s)]
*  I can trust her. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4281.82s)]
*  I tell people, that's why I said earlier about the Olympics, man, when the game [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4283.42s)]
*  was so easy, when you play with better players, the game was on the heart when [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4287.34s)]
*  you play with guys who suck, you know, you know, like, because everybody is [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4291.34s)]
*  looking at you to like Chuck got the ball. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4297.14s)]
*  Every defender is looking at you, but you playing with Marley, KJ, Seth [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4301.14s)]
*  Savallo when I won MVP, it was, that was the easiest basketball I ever had to play. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4306.14s)]
*  The other thing they have to figure out is anecdotally, I can't believe how [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4312.66s)]
*  many people in my life have been watching WNBA and have hardcore opinions on it. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4316.34s)]
*  I'm getting an Angel Reese versus Caitlin Clark rookie of the year [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4320.34s)]
*  arguments and first team on NBA. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4323.78s)]
*  They got to figure out the schedule for the playoffs. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4326.38s)]
*  Cause I just think going against football is, is just a no-win situation. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4328.7s)]
*  I would love to see them try to figure out the little nooks so that [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4333.66s)]
*  they can actually get attention. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4336.78s)]
*  The number one thing they got to do is find a way to let people [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4338.46s)]
*  know what the damn games are. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4341.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4343.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, that's another issue. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4344.38s)]
*  It's on four places. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4345.42s)]
*  It doesn't even matter about magic. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4346.82s)]
*  It don't even matter about the playoffs. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4348.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4351.0599999999995s)]
*  If you have to go to, I saw some, I was watching some game that like it's called [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4351.7s)]
*  eye on, eye on. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4355.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4356.58s)]
*  It's been huge for iron. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4356.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4358.26s)]
*  No, it's been good for them. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4358.54s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4359.42s)]
*  It's that since I was like, damn. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4359.82s)]
*  I mean, like, no, you can't ask basketball fans to try to find iron. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4362.1s)]
*  I mean, they were about to make you a big offer. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4368.14s)]
*  Now they're going to pull it. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4370.46s)]
*  Hey, listen, you sloshed your eye on buddy. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4373.5s)]
*  Hey, listen, man, let me tell you something. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4375.66s)]
*  Hey, you got to wait till that LinkedIn profile come out. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4377.62s)]
*  I was joking around on my, I was, I'm a file out a LinkedIn profile and it's [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4381.58s)]
*  going to be like, I've never had a real job. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4386.86s)]
*  So I only know how to write that down. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4389.9s)]
*  Like what's your, what's, what is, what's on your resume? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4392.06s)]
*  I'm like, well, I've never had, I've never had a real basketball player, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4395.18s)]
*  basketball, but that's not a real job. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4400.22s)]
*  They're going to be like, well, that's not a real job. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4403.06s)]
*  I said, no, it's not. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4404.82s)]
*  But they paid me. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4405.54s)]
*  So I call it a real job. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4406.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, the, I mean, the most impressive thing you've done. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4408.179999999999s)]
*  I think you broke Muhammad Ali's record for most times retiring. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4410.7s)]
*  No, actually, you know, I'm so glad you asked me that question. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4414.7s)]
*  Cause it's not a question. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4418.139999999999s)]
*  It's a fact. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4419.099999999999s)]
*  No, no, I built, let me tell you something. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4419.94s)]
*  I love when people say that. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4422.5s)]
*  And I was just, well, if you would ask Lee, they would listen to what I said. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4423.78s)]
*  I have been very specific on my retirement. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4430.0199999999995s)]
*  So you're not retiring. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4433.98s)]
*  Well, I am at some point. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4435.7s)]
*  Come on. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4437.459999999999s)]
*  You love this. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4438.339999999999s)]
*  What are you going to retire for? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4439.0599999999995s)]
*  You're still fantastic at this. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4440.179999999999s)]
*  No, cause I'm over 60. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4442.5s)]
*  Who cares? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4443.74s)]
*  60 is the new 50. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4444.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4445.98s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4446.339999999999s)]
*  That's what all young people say. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4446.7s)]
*  Wait till your ass get my age. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4447.94s)]
*  So, so my original game plan was a retired 60. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4449.58s)]
*  I made that. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4453.58s)]
*  And I had told TNT, I said, I'm retiring at 60 and they're like, okay. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4455.419999999999s)]
*  And I said, Hey, I'm just giving y'all a heads up. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4460.900000000001s)]
*  I'm retiring next year. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4463.54s)]
*  They're like, you got to stay till the new deal is done. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4465.46s)]
*  I'm like, Oh, cause they needed you for the negotiation. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4471.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4474.9800000000005s)]
*  But literally I know they were going to fuck that up. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4475.66s)]
*  And I was like, I say, you know what? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4479.900000000001s)]
*  You guys been great to me. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4482.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4484.66s)]
*  I'll stay for two more years. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4486.14s)]
*  So next year was supposed to be my last year and I was going to walk off into the [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4490.66s)]
*  sunset, but little did I know, like I just said, cause it would have been perfect. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4495.62s)]
*  The pastor torch to this quarter or Jamal Crawford, Hey, 25 years. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4504.14s)]
*  Thank y'all. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4510.1s)]
*  I'll be 62 years old. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4510.66s)]
*  And the market rates came. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4513.860000000001s)]
*  I says, Oh, this is actually even better for me. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4517.94s)]
*  I can walk away after next year and don't have to worry about [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4521.9s)]
*  going to another network. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4524.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4526.58s)]
*  And so when they came to meet with me, they're like, you want to keep doing the show. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4528.46s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4535.219999999999s)]
*  We don't even have basketball. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4535.82s)]
*  And so it really put through me for a loop. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4539.179999999999s)]
*  The only good thing about it, I got to keep a lot of people, their job. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4542.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4547.219999999999s)]
*  But I made it very clear, man, I'm not going to keep working forever. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4547.46s)]
*  Um, I'm going to do at least one more year so everybody can keep the job for another. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4554.66s)]
*  If that's what I have zero idea what we're going to do, let me get that out of the way. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4559.54s)]
*  Well, you have basketball next year, at least. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4563.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4565.86s)]
*  So we were already going to do next year, no matter what, but they said, I want to [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4566.099999999999s)]
*  keep doing the show a year after that. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4570.179999999999s)]

*  You've 40 years since the, since like that, uh, when you did make the Olympic [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4600.259999999999s)]

*  Uh, but at some point I want to retire sooner than later, plain and simple. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4613.74s)]
*  I don't think you're going to retire. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4620.06s)]
*  Well, it's going to be interesting because I have zero idea what we're going to do [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4623.14s)]
*  because we won't have basketball. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4629.78s)]
*  But you're talking a year from now. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4632.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4633.5s)]
*  But I have zero idea what we're going to do. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4635.06s)]
*  Would it make more sense for one of the partners just to grab the show though? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4637.700000000001s)]
*  What makes it even funnier? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4641.5s)]
*  They don't even have no idea what we're going to do. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4643.38s)]
*  So I'm sitting, I'm sitting in this meeting in Philly. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4646.54s)]
*  I'm like, we want to keep doing the show. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4650.9800000000005s)]
*  I was like, what do you mean? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4653.46s)]
*  Like we want to keep you all together. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4654.860000000001s)]
*  I says, well, I'm, I would consider that because I want all my [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4656.9400000000005s)]
*  friends to keep their jobs. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4662.06s)]
*  I said, what are we going to do? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4663.820000000001s)]
*  They're like, we haven't figured that out yet. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4665.7s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4669.02s)]
*  I says, we won't have basketball. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4670.26s)]
*  What the hell are we going to do? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4672.54s)]
*  And so that's, that's the thing. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4675.34s)]
*  It's that, that's the thing that's fascinating. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4676.780000000001s)]
*  I can say, I know we got one more year with the NBA, then we're going to lose it. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4678.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4684.46s)]
*  They want to, they want to do the show at least another year. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4684.66s)]
*  But I'm like, we don't even have basketball. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4687.7s)]
*  We're going to pay for highlights. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4691.46s)]
*  So they were saying, we'll figure it out, but they just lost the NBA. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4693.5s)]
*  So tough, tough, maybe to have the trust that the next decision is going to go. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4697.7s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4702.780000000001s)]
*  It was like, you just fucking lost the NBA over like four conference finals. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4703.900000000001s)]
*  Hey, and I got a truck. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4707.22s)]
*  Y'all. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4708.900000000001s)]
*  Hey, this is what it is, brother. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4713.42s)]
*  Well, listen, I mean, it's certainly the most imitated show. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4715.54s)]
*  I still think people don't completely understand why it works so well. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4719.62s)]
*  You're the biggest reason, but for people with chemistry, with a host that drives it, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4723.42s)]
*  I remember coming to see you in Atlanta in like 2002 to write about it. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4729.62s)]
*  And the show hasn't changed really since 2002. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4733.9s)]
*  It's the same formula. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4736.099999999999s)]
*  And yet everybody else fucks it up. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4738.54s)]
*  Like remember the women's basketball that in the college tournament and the ESPN, they [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4740.0599999999995s)]
*  had, they had a really good studio show with three people. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4745.14s)]
*  And they were excellent. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4748.099999999999s)]
*  And then it got to the final four and they're like, we're going to bring in two more people. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4749.38s)]
*  Now we have five. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4752.5s)]
*  It's like, you guys just fucking struck oil with the show. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4754.0599999999995s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4757.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, they can't help themselves. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4758.5s)]
*  You know, if people would understand, you have to have a mixture of basketball and fun. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4760.9s)]
*  And like people like, you can't be all fun and no basketball. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4766.86s)]
*  You can't be all basketball because you're trying to reach two different audiences. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4771.26s)]
*  I always tell my sisters, we already got the basketball fans. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4774.54s)]
*  We already got that. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4779.1s)]
*  If people go watch basketball, they're going to watch. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4780.1s)]
*  The key is can we make it fun for the wife, the girlfriends and the kids? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4782.34s)]
*  And they give us complete control. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4787.54s)]
*  And they give you time to talk. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4790.9400000000005s)]
*  They give you seven to 10 minute segments, which is another thing people don't realize. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4792.3s)]
*  A hundred percent, a hundred percent. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4796.34s)]
*  They give you time to, to breathe and do your thing. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4798.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4801.62s)]
*  It's, it's funny. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4801.86s)]
*  Bill, I'll tell you something. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4803.58s)]
*  There's times when we're talking and they're like, we got to go to commercial and we'll be [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4805.46s)]
*  like, shut the fuck up. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4810.660000000001s)]
*  We're not done. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4812.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4813.26s)]
*  We're going to another, nobody wants to see another fucking commercial. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4813.46s)]
*  We're holding because like sometimes they'll be in your ear. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4816.780000000001s)]
*  I like, Hey, shut the fuck up. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4821.22s)]
*  We'd see her talking here. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4823.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4825.3s)]
*  Because I thought you, man, you can't like, sometimes you need time to explain, especially [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4825.620000000001s)]
*  when you're talking about something serious, but sometimes you're trying to explain [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4831.34s)]
*  something there in your damn ear. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4835.7s)]
*  Like we got to go. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4837.06s)]
*  We got to go. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4838.02s)]
*  I said, what the hell are we going? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4838.62s)]
*  We hear from seven to two in the morning. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4840.14s)]
*  You can't hold a commercial for another damn minute. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4842.18s)]
*  Well, you guys figured it out. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4846.58s)]
*  Whatever it was. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4848.62s)]
*  That's the other thing that people I think miss with it is you, the four of you would [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4849.3s)]
*  have that combo anyway. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4853.74s)]
*  I know we've made these points a million times, but it has to have four people. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4855.06s)]
*  And I think it's either four or three. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4859.5s)]
*  It shouldn't be five before people that would hang out and talk basketball, regardless [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4860.82s)]
*  of whether the cameras were on and they never figured that part either. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4864.78s)]
*  They'll just throw. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4867.86s)]
*  They think it's like a fantasy team and we'll see what happens with these new deals. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4869.5s)]
*  When the Amazon and NBC are putting people together and like, well, we got this, got [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4873.62s)]
*  this and we're good. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4877.219999999999s)]
*  And they put no thought into, well, would those three people hang out together? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4877.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's going to be fascinating. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4881.98s)]
*  In what respect? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4885.7s)]
*  Like. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4887.38s)]
*  Putting their teams together. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4888.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4891.1s)]
*  Cause she just can't pick people. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4892.9s)]
*  Like you said, they got to have chemistry. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4896.74s)]
*  You say like, Oh yeah, I want to hang out and talk basketball with this guy or this [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4899.46s)]
*  girl. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4903.14s)]
*  So who NBC and Amazon put together is going to be amazing. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4904.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm still not ruling you out. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4909.22s)]
*  It still feels like the smartest solution. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4910.54s)]
*  All this is just to take the entire infrastructure you guys have and move it to a different [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4912.86s)]
*  network that is basketball. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4917.299999999999s)]
*  And I don't understand why that wouldn't happen. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4918.82s)]
*  Well, number one, I don't think Ernie would go. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4921.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't think Ernie would go because he doesn't want to leave Atlanta. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4924.66s)]
*  Ernie would. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4926.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4927.94s)]
*  Ernie would leave Atlanta ever. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4928.179999999999s)]
*  And so filming in Atlanta. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4930.34s)]
*  Well. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4932.66s)]

*  Hey, hey, everything is on the board. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4936.98s)]
*  I say, Hey, hey, Bill. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4939.299999999999s)]
*  I told you earlier, I have, we have zero fucking idea what's going to happen after [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4941.38s)]
*  this year. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4946.02s)]
*  Zero. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4946.38s)]
*  Well, as I think you have like three or four more retirements in you over the next [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4948.06s)]
*  like 12 months, it's going to be like, but Ali just is like Spinks. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4951.820000000001s)]
*  This is it. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4955.22s)]
*  I'm done. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4956.42s)]
*  I saw him fight Larry. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4957.54s)]
*  It's like Spinks too. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4958.54s)]
*  I'm back. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4959.34s)]
*  I, you know, Muhammad Ali is one of my heroes. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4960.34s)]
*  I actually just watched the Larry Holmes fight sometime in the last couple of weeks. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4962.820000000001s)]
*  I love watching old documentaries. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4968.38s)]
*  Not that one. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4970.1s)]
*  That was ugly. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4971.14s)]
*  And that's a bad one. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4972.18s)]
*  That's a bad one. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4973.54s)]
*  Well, you know, boxing's had an incredible resurgence. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4974.900000000001s)]
*  It's another one boxing and the WNBA are the two winners of 2024. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4978.22s)]
*  There's more good boxing fights in that we've had in a while. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4982.5s)]
*  Yeah, but they want to all fight each other. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4986.660000000001s)]
*  That's the one thing I hate. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4988.38s)]
*  Boxing is my second favorite sport. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4989.46s)]
*  I told you. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4990.860000000001s)]
*  But now they're starting to fight each other because the Saudis are like, here's [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4991.660000000001s)]
*  money. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4994.58s)]
*  Five to 10 years. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4994.900000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4996.26s)]
*  Cause Mayweather and TechOwl should have fought five years before they fought. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=4997.5s)]
*  But now we're in a good spot. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5001.660000000001s)]
*  Like, have you seen Bacoli, the heavyweight who looks like George Foreman? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5003.18s)]
*  I have, but let me tell you something. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5007.06s)]
*  That's my guy. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5008.46s)]
*  But listen, Anthony Joshua is a stud, but I want to see, they got Canelo fighting [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5009.660000000001s)]
*  next weekend against Berlanga. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5016.22s)]
*  Ben Avetis to me, you got Bud Crawford out there right now. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5020.5s)]
*  Man, it's some good fights that they would make them. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5023.900000000001s)]
*  The heavyweights are good. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5026.1s)]
*  No, we got some good cards coming up. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5026.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm bullish on boxing. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5028.660000000001s)]
*  All right, Chuck, what's your football prediction before we go? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5030.0599999999995s)]
*  Who you have for the Superbowl? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5033.46s)]
*  Well, my Eagles are going to the Superbowl. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5035.62s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5038.9s)]
*  I didn't know if you were serious with that, but we're going for Eagles against [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5039.86s)]
*  who? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5042.62s)]
*  The Buffalo Bills. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5043.5s)]
*  Buffalo Bills. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5045.66s)]
*  And the Buffalo Bills win their first Superbowl. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5046.98s)]
*  They are the most underrated great team ever. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5051.099999999999s)]
*  To make it to four straight Superbowls will never ever happen again. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5054.58s)]
*  I got the Eagles against the Bills and the Bills win their first Superbowl. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5058.780000000001s)]
*  So I have the Lions over the Texans. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5064.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5067.3s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5068.22s)]
*  I got a man crush on Dan Campbell. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5070.54s)]
*  I love that dude. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5072.740000000001s)]
*  I love Mr. Dan Campbell. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5075.02s)]
*  I was on the Lions bandwagon all last year. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5076.54s)]
*  I love Dan Campbell. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5082.58s)]
*  I got to meet Dan Campbell. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5084.9400000000005s)]
*  So I picked the Lions, the team that hasn't won since 1957. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5086.5s)]
*  And you took the Bills, the team that's never won, I don't think ever since like [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5091.42s)]
*  maybe 1960. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5095.38s)]
*  And those are our two picks. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5097.34s)]
*  So I'm going to say we're probably going to be wrong if Patrick Mahomes will win [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5098.62s)]
*  again. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5101.1s)]
*  That's the best thing about when sports start every year, man. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5102.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5107.900000000001s)]
*  Possibilities. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5108.46s)]
*  The possibilities are amazing. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5109.58s)]
*  Well, if Mahomes wins this year, now we can officially... [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5112.5s)]
*  I'm not ready to have the Jordan conversation, but I'm willing to assemble [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5116.219999999999s)]
*  everybody in the room so we can start thinking about it. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5119.86s)]
*  Let's stop that to Brady conversation. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5123.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5125.179999999999s)]
*  Let's don't go to Jordan yet. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5125.42s)]
*  Well, I'm just... [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5126.74s)]
*  If he wins three in a row, we can have the Tom Brady conversation. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5131.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5137.66s)]
*  I'm just saying... [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5138.58s)]
*  Not to Jordan yet. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5139.34s)]
*  I just... [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5140.9800000000005s)]
*  Jordan, the three in a row made me think of that when Jordan did the three-peat. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5141.7s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5145.66s)]
*  The three-peat, I get mad at people. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5146.14s)]
*  Listen, I love Pat. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5149.74s)]
*  I hate when people try to push him already past Brady because what Brady did, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5151.38s)]
*  10 Super Bowls, come on, man. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5156.1s)]
*  Come on. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5158.34s)]
*  Stop it. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5159.02s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5159.42s)]
*  Also, they're going to provoke Brady and they're coming back again. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5160.06s)]
*  Oh, I tell you what, I cannot wait to see him on. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5164.42s)]
*  I think he's going to be fabulous on television. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5166.86s)]
*  I think he's going to be good. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5168.62s)]
*  The reports are he took it seriously. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5169.98s)]
*  He's putting in the time and he's actually going to say shit. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5172.0199999999995s)]
*  The fact that he did the roast made me think. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5175.139999999999s)]
*  Dude, let me tell you something. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5177.219999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5181.139999999999s)]
*  So he's going to be great at eight. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5182.219999999999s)]
*  I tell you what, Belichick is going to be great on TV too. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5183.86s)]
*  Well, he's on every TV. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5187.139999999999s)]
*  He's doing like five different shows. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5188.66s)]
*  So I'm worried he might've done too much. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5190.46s)]
*  Well, he don't have a job, so he got plenty of time. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5192.94s)]
*  I know. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFwOXtG8I4&t=5194.86s)]
