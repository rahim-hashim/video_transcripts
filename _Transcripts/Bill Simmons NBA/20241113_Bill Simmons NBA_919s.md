# Klay Thompson Isnâ€™t Missed by Golden State (At Least Not Yet) | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw)
*  The game was awesome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=0.0s)]
*  And, Jacobi, my big takeaway from that game, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=2.0s)]
*  and we'll get into the staff, the clay, all that stuff, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=4.64s)]
*  but that felt like a round two [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  or a round three playoff game to me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=8.64s)]
*  And I wasn't positive that the Warriors [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=10.64s)]
*  maybe were ready to swim in that pool yet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=15.36s)]
*  Despite all the evidence, they've had some good games, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=17.36s)]
*  they have good record, but that tonight [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=19.68s)]
*  felt like round two or round three to me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  What'd you think? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=24.16s)]
*  I was so sick of this game by like four o'clock this afternoon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=25.92s)]
*  It was just the coverage, just over, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=29.2s)]
*  and just so much, so much clay returning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=31.12s)]
*  And like, knowing what I know about clay, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=33.68s)]
*  I didn't think that he cared that much, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=34.96s)]
*  but it lived up to all the hype. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=36.96s)]
*  Like, even the announcement, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=38.64s)]
*  I cried very easily, so I got a little emotional. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=42.72s)]
*  I didn't cry, but I got a little emotional. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=45.2s)]
*  I was about to, I was like, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=46.88s)]
*  God, I can't believe he's not crying. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=47.68s)]
*  And then the start of the game, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=49.68s)]
*  you ejaculate fluids, that's what you do. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=51.28s)]
*  Give him the ball, the first play gets fouled, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=54.08s)]
*  he goes to the line, but it was up and down for clay. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=56.08s)]
*  I felt so connected to him, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  and I was rooting for him so hard. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=60.64s)]
*  He had an air ball at the side of the backboard [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  of the third quarter, and then another air ball after that, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=64.08s)]
*  and I was like, oh no, this is falling apart. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=66.24s)]
*  But then he had a nice little flourish in the fourth quarter. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=68.08s)]
*  The whole day, I was skeptical about this entire experience, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=71.36s)]
*  watching this basketball tonight, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=75.68s)]
*  and I could not have enjoyed it more. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=77.28s)]
*  Kurt, can you even mention Steph Curry, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=79.36s)]
*  who is back with a capital B, doing Steph Curry stuff. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=82.32s)]
*  I was thinking as he was doing it, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=85.52s)]
*  I'm gonna really miss it when it's gone. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=89.2s)]
*  A 10 out of 10, I think about the future, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=93.28s)]
*  when we don't have Jokic and Curry, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=96.56s)]
*  and it just makes me sad, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  because those are my two favorite day-to-day league pass guys. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  I'm just trying to appreciate it in the moment, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=102.4s)]
*  but he did it again. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  It was almost like it was Clay's night, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=105.28s)]
*  and there was a little, like he had to big boy the night [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  a little bit, it felt like, didn't you? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=110.72s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=113.2s)]
*  And I think it felt like the Warriors [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  were gonna lose that game. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  I think they were down seven or something, I wanna say. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=117.84s)]
*  And then Stefan just, yeah, he was like, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm the prime splash brother right now, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=123.04s)]
*  and I'm going to take over. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  And I feel like we're seeing the night-night [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  more often than ever, starting with the Olympics. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=129.84s)]
*  But also I think that's two night-nights [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=132.72s)]
*  we've seen this week alone. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  But this one was especially sort of potent with Clay, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=136.72s)]
*  who had a pretty good shooting night, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=140.0s)]
*  a couple of bad ones like Jokowi said, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=141.36s)]
*  but still ended up, it was nice to see Clay make six threes, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=143.84s)]
*  but you were right, Stefan made the most impressive ones [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=147.52s)]
*  when the game was on the line, it was just awesome. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=150.24s)]
*  Well, the cool thing, these are guys that we weren't sure [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=152.56s)]
*  if we may have seen the best of all of them, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=156.16s)]
*  Especially Clay. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  Draymond last year was like, is this guy even gonna be able [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=160.0s)]
*  to be a functional NBA star for seven months here? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  And then Curry, even before the Olympics, it's like, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  all right, our guy's passing him now, is SGA ahead of him? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=170.0s)]
*  We're doing this Ringer 100 exercise with the Vodi next week, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=173.36s)]
*  you know, that was always a tough one to put Curry in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=177.2s)]
*  because you gotta bring the resume and the experience [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=179.84s)]
*  and all the stuff he's done over the years, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=182.32s)]
*  but he still has to back it up every once in a while, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=184.72s)]
*  and I felt like he did it today, but the Clay piece of Ichikobos. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=186.88s)]
*  So as the Celtic fan, we had guys come back, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=194.0s)]
*  but they were like washed up versions of themselves, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  like Robert Parrish came back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=201.76s)]
*  I forget whether he was on Charlotte or Chicago, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=204.08s)]
*  it was like over, he was hanging on for a few more paychecks, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=206.8s)]
*  it's like, oh, the chief, man, it's so glad he's doing well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  We never had, I don't remember a core guy coming back like this [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  and the emotions that you would feel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=218.0s)]
*  The closest thing I can come to is when Bird was coaching [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=220.56s)]
*  the Pacers and he would come back as the Pacers coach, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  it's like, ah, this sucks, you know, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  got Larry Bird on the other side, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=229.28000000000003s)]
*  but you know, you're a natural skeptic, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=230.96s)]
*  you're an emotional skeptic from time to time, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=234.88s)]
*  you're a zagger, you tried to zag against Wembee [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=236.96s)]
*  early this season, I loved it, I thought it was great, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=240.16s)]
*  but yet you're an emotional guy too. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=243.28s)]
*  So this is gamut of emotions for you here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=245.84s)]
*  And there was just so much coverage of it, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  and he literally said, he's like, I'm so locked in, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=254.08s)]
*  I don't talk to those guys anymore. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=256.48s)]
*  And I was like, huh, but he's been, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=258.32s)]
*  he's been well chronicled as sort of like a little bit of an aloof, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=261.28s)]
*  sort of like Zen master goofball, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  and that just makes him more likable. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=267.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you remember the Grantland days [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=269.35999999999996s)]
*  and the clay theism and all of that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  And like, I just felt like he's not the type to get wrapped up in this [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=272.32s)]
*  the way other players would. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=276.56s)]
*  But when you could tell that he was wrapped up in it, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  and as was I, as was I, and the game lived up to it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  Like, I was very skeptical of this whole, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure we'll talk about the Emirates NBA Cup, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  and then the whole thing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=293.84s)]
*  But I was just, I'm glad. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  What is Emirates? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  Is Emirates an airline? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=297.68s)]
*  What is it? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  It's an airline. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  It's an airline. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=300.88s)]
*  They'll take you straight to Abu Dhabi. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=301.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=303.28s)]
*  Great. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  Good. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=304.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=304.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=304.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=305.84s)]
*  And I was skeptical of the whole thing, the entire thing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=307.2s)]
*  But I walk away from tonight being like, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't even have anything to complain about. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=315.76s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=317.44s)]
*  It was a great six hours. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=319.12s)]
*  It reminded me of, remember we would always tease Jalen [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=320.64s)]
*  about somebody that we knew he wasn't cool with, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=324.32s)]
*  and he's like, no, no, we're cool. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=326.64s)]
*  We're cool. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=327.84s)]
*  No, no, no, we're fine. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=329.12s)]
*  I wonder if that's Klay talking about the Warriors. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=330.64s)]
*  I have no idea how much he talks to those guys. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=333.28s)]
*  If you read between the lines with all the Warriors stuff, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=336.56s)]
*  everyone seemed to think it was time for him to move on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=340.24s)]
*  Even the Warriors side, it's like, hey, man, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  the guy was unhappy last year, which, you know, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Kirk, like you spent some time with the Spurs. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=348.48s)]
*  Kawhi, the situation was a little similar, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it was way more acrimonious, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=353.68s)]
*  but it hit a point where it's like, all right, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  this doesn't work anymore. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  It's time for this dude to move on. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=358.56s)]
*  And it seems like everybody's happy, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=360.72s)]
*  but at the same time, when they're going against each other [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=362.72s)]
*  in a playoff game and Curry's doing the night night [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  and grabbing the gold stage chairs, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=368.32s)]
*  it's like, ah, there's a little bit of a fuck you in this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  Fuck you, but they all have captain's hats on [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  while they're saying fuck you to them, I guess. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  But dude, it was the CBA is a very cruel device. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=377.68s)]
*  It's not a very nostalgic device. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=382.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, this version of it, Bill, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=384.16s)]
*  is really just so harsh on teams. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=387.52s)]
*  And it's so punitive for teams that overspend on players [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=391.36s)]
*  that aren't good enough for numbers. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's what Clay was getting to. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=397.76s)]
*  And dude, I think, forget tonight just for a second. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=400.16s)]
*  They're nine and two. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  They won in Boston. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=405.12s)]
*  They got beat in Cleveland. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=406.96s)]
*  They won at Oklahoma City. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=408.56s)]
*  Then they just beat a Dallas team. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  They're on a hell of a run here. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=411.91999999999996s)]
*  They look deep. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  And I'm here to say that Mike Dunleavy and that group, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=415.76s)]
*  as hard as this choice was, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=418.88s)]
*  it looks like they made the right team building choice [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=421.68s)]
*  to get the last maybe chance with Stephen Curry [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=424.56s)]
*  to get an MVP or to compete for a championship. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  So as hard as it was, I think they made the right call. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=431.28s)]
*  Kirk's lights literally just turned off [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=436.32s)]
*  as soon as he was coming to that point. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=438.16s)]
*  And you saw tonight, Buddy Hield was on the bench [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=440.24s)]
*  for crunch time, right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=442.56s)]
*  That would have been Clay. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=443.6s)]
*  Because they needed the defense from that two guard spot. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=445.04s)]
*  So Melton was out there and that was the difference. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=447.92s)]
*  I really respect what they did because they're over or under, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=452.0s)]
*  I think, before the year. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=455.68s)]
*  I think it was 43 and a half. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=456.64s)]
*  And they're playing odds were even odds. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=459.44s)]
*  I don't think any, it just felt like a team in transition [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=461.92s)]
*  that was kind of trying to chug along [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=465.36s)]
*  until January, February to make a trade [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=467.2s)]
*  for a disgruntled superstar was the vibe. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=469.6s)]
*  But watching them these first three weeks, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=472.56s)]
*  I don't know, Jaco, do they feel like, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=475.12s)]
*  would you go fringe contender, real contender? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=477.04s)]
*  Where would you go? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=479.76s)]
*  No, no. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=481.12s)]
*  Good story, good start team. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=484.0s)]
*  I don't think this is scalable. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, the rabbit. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=487.12s)]
*  Yeah, this is not like a 55 win, two seed in the West. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=488.16s)]
*  I just do not see it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=493.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=494.96s)]
*  I think this is a fast out of the gate team [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=496.0s)]
*  that will come back down to earth very, very soon. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=497.84s)]
*  See, I see it because of the defense. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=499.68s)]
*  I think that when we get to April, May, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  defenses would start to separate people. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=505.84s)]
*  And the defense that they play to me is top five [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  from what I'm watching, especially when you think [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  Minnesota slipped defensively, the Knicks have slipped [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=512.96s)]
*  defensively, you start going around the league [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=515.68s)]
*  and asking yourself who actually can play defense. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=517.52s)]
*  I don't know, how many defenses do you love, Kirk? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=521.6s)]
*  Not many. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=524.72s)]
*  And when they've won the championship, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=525.28s)]
*  that's been their formula. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=526.8s)]
*  They're going to be remembered for all the threes, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=527.76s)]
*  but the defense that Draymond has been running for years [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  is great. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=532.16s)]
*  And this game down the stretch bill was a great example. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  We had Wiggins like really guarding Donchus [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  about as well as anybody can. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=537.92s)]
*  Welcome back, Andrew Wiggins. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=539.04s)]
*  Welcome back to the league. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=540.64s)]
*  He looks different. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  And then you have Draymond himself really getting [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=543.04s)]
*  into Gafford in some of the key moments [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=545.92s)]
*  and turning that seven point lead into a tie game. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=548.0s)]
*  And so everybody's going to think of this game [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=550.8s)]
*  as like a microcosm. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=552.88s)]
*  Everybody's going to think of this game for Steph [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=553.92s)]
*  and those late threes, but it was also some major stops [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=555.36s)]
*  by some A plus defenders. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=558.8s)]
*  I will zag, I think this is for real. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=561.36s)]
*  I think they could be 14 and two in their next, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=565.12s)]
*  if we wake up in a week or two, they're 14 and two. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=568.56s)]
*  If you look at their next five games, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=571.04s)]
*  that really seems like a contender, assuming Steph [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=573.36s)]
*  and Draymond are able to stay healthy, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=576.16s)]
*  which at their age is a big question, obviously. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=577.68s)]
*  Chikobi, still time. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=580.64s)]
*  Still time to get on the bandwagon. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=583.52s)]
*  I'm off. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=585.68s)]
*  They're playing the banged up Grizzlies, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=586.72s)]
*  at Clippers, home Hawks, at Pelicans, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=589.68s)]
*  and at your guy Wimby. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=594.88s)]
*  That's the next five. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=597.2s)]
*  This is the same thing that's happening with the Bucks [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=598.48s)]
*  is we're going to think very, very highly of the Warriors [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=600.24s)]
*  in two weeks. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=604.64s)]
*  And we're going to think that the Bucks have righted [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=605.52s)]
*  the ship in two weeks, but it's just schedule based. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=607.52s)]
*  It's not basketball based. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=609.76s)]
*  Outside of Steph, who can get you a bucket? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=612.96s)]
*  Jesus, what's happening to you? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=615.52s)]
*  What's happening to you? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=617.6s)]
*  Is it the three kids? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=618.48s)]
*  Is that why you've become a negative guy? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=619.68s)]
*  You were so positive and happy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=622.72s)]
*  Now you're just ground down by fatherhood. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=624.24s)]
*  Now you're just the negative guy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=626.16s)]
*  I just want to know, is it Steph Curry? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=627.28s)]
*  It's Steph Curry. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=629.2s)]
*  And he's great. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=630.4s)]
*  Yeah, but here's, it's Steph Curry, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=631.52s)]
*  but it's also Wiggins looking like Wiggins [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=633.76s)]
*  from two, three years ago. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=635.92s)]
*  And it's Draymond, no drama yet from him [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  looking about as athletic as he's looked in a couple years. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=641.84s)]
*  And that was the surprise to me because if you had told me [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=644.96s)]
*  they were going to trade him this summer of 2024, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=648.4000000000001s)]
*  I'd have been like, you're right, it's time. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=651.44s)]
*  Too much drama, too many things have happened. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=653.2s)]
*  Maybe fresh start, try to get some assets. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  But now that would be crazy when you watch this guy play now. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=658.24s)]
*  He's still one of the best five or six defensive players. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=660.72s)]
*  With that said, he'll probably do something dumb [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=663.44s)]
*  in the next 48 hours. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=665.12s)]
*  And that'll be it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=666.88s)]
*  I mean, he almost did it the other day. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=667.6s)]
*  He did the flailing thing. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=668.88s)]
*  Jacobes, I have a really important question [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=670.4s)]
*  to ask you about the night night. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=672.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=674.64s)]
*  You're... [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=678.48s)]
*  Don't ask the question, I'll give you the answer. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=680.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=682.24s)]
*  I think it needs to be reserved like a Mike Breen bang. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=682.64s)]
*  I think it's being overused. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=686.88s)]
*  Like a double, like a Mike Breen double bang? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=688.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=690.88s)]
*  Or a Mike Breen bang? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=691.12s)]
*  No, no, just a bang. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=691.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=692.88s)]
*  Ah, probably a double bang, so a 1.5 bang. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  It's being overused and it's losing. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=696.24s)]
*  It's diluting its effectiveness. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=698.0s)]
*  It's being overused because he's winning these major games. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=699.84s)]
*  He beat Oklahoma City on their home court the other night. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=702.8s)]
*  He beats Clay tonight. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=705.52s)]
*  He wins the freaking gold medal. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=706.72s)]
*  Like these are not... [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=708.3199999999999s)]
*  He's not out there overusing it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=709.76s)]
*  So can I be the tie-breaking vote? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=712.24s)]
*  I love it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=715.12s)]
*  I think it's great. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=716.72s)]
*  It's become like almost like a wrestling finishing move now. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=718.4s)]
*  Now I'm like wanting... [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  Now when he went up four or 25 seconds, I was like, do it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=723.04s)]
*  Do the night-night. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=726.64s)]
*  Do it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=728.0s)]
*  It's great. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=729.28s)]
*  It's also good because it brings out like dad vibes. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=729.76s)]
*  It's like, go to bed little child. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=732.64s)]
*  Night-night. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=734.88s)]
*  It's just very condescending. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=735.6s)]
*  Also it brings back memories to the France game, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=738.0s)]
*  which was like a legitimately great American sports moment. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=740.8s)]
*  And so every time he does it, I think of that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=743.6s)]
*  But I just feel like LeBron must be furious that he didn't think of this. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=745.52s)]
*  He's probably fired his quirk management, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=750.24s)]
*  whoever the guy is on his team, quirk edition management. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like, how did you not give me the night-night? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=758.32s)]
*  I would have been doing that like 2013. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=760.08s)]
*  You gave me a book. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=762.08s)]
*  You gave me the Godfather. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=763.44s)]
*  That was supposed to be my thing. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  You guys were supposed to come up with ideas like this for me. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=766.72s)]
*  Why don't I have the night-night? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=769.12s)]
*  This weird stomp thing on my chest, it sucks. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=771.84s)]
*  Kirk, where do you see Dallas right now? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=776.08s)]
*  And the whole contender hierarchy for you, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  because they're a little off, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=781.2s)]
*  but I think it's mostly because Luca doesn't look like Luca. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  These are the exact games that we're not seeing in the Eastern Conference. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=785.6s)]
*  So it's unfair for me to almost judge them. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=789.2s)]
*  They didn't really click until the second half of last year. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=792.08s)]
*  And that's probably generous. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=795.76s)]
*  It was really February when this team really started to click. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=796.96s)]
*  So with the addition of Clay Thompson, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=800.96s)]
*  I think they're going to be very good. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=804.72s)]
*  They're five and six, I think, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=806.08s)]
*  which is probably not what they want to be. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=807.84s)]
*  But dude, I'll say I'm not worried about the Dallas Mavericks. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=810.72s)]
*  I think their defense will come around. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=815.2s)]
*  I think if you have Luca and Clay and Kyrie, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=817.0400000000001s)]
*  your offense is going to be fine against every team in the league. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=820.08s)]
*  So I'm not worried. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=823.5200000000001s)]
*  I think this is just an awkward start. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=824.4000000000001s)]
*  And they're playing the kinds of opponents, Bill, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  that we're not seeing Eastern Conference teams have to play. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=827.5200000000001s)]
*  I was watching some of these Eastern Conference emperors, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  Emirates Cup games this evening. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=835.76s)]
*  And some of the basketball wasn't as good, I would say. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=838.0s)]
*  I noticed. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=845.12s)]
*  So you think the Emirates Cup was better last year? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=845.92s)]
*  Maybe it's peaked. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=850.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=853.52s)]
*  I'll tell you what I don't like about the Clay Thompson era in Dallas. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=854.9599999999999s)]
*  When he takes 17 shots in a game and Kyrie Irving takes 13. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=858.7199999999999s)]
*  If I'm the other team, I'm like, great. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=863.12s)]
*  That sounds awesome. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=865.6s)]
*  So Clay's going to take the second most shots on your team? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=867.2800000000001s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=870.96s)]
*  We'll sign up for that right now. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=872.32s)]
*  Because I felt like Kyrie could have gone by anybody he wanted in that game tonight. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=873.7600000000001s)]
*  And I still think he's terrifying. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=877.6s)]
*  And I still feel like, I know Clay's like the new toy. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=879.5200000000001s)]
*  It's like when Jacobes, when we used to play pick up once upon a time, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  we'd bring the third person and we'd try to get them involved in the first game. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=888.08s)]
*  Then we want to stay in the court. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=891.76s)]
*  We went back to what we did. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=893.04s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=895.04s)]
*  Eventually, Clay is going to be, hey Clay, stand in the corner and you'll get your eight threes. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=896.56s)]
*  But the big boys are going to handle this down the stretch. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=901.12s)]
*  That's how this will play out, I would guess. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=904.16s)]
*  I think so. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8WbtEqY3Tw&t=906.72s)]
