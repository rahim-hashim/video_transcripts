# The Pistons Canâ€™t Catch a Break | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdrdttS-bVw)
*  The Pistons lose 25 straight.
*  This is a number in 2023 that seems impossible with the amount of three
*  pointers everybody takes just three point variance alone.
*  It's almost like flipping a coin 25 times and getting heads 25 times.
*  Seems as realistic to me.
*  And yet they did it.
*  And looking at the schedule, this might keep going and nobody's talking about this,
*  but we're talking about it now.
*  I don't see where it's going to end.
*  I mean, and tonight was the place where it would have ended, right?
*  I mean, I looked at it when I was on the show this afternoon, Bill,
*  Lowry Markin is out, Jordan Clark is out,
*  Keante George is out, Taylan Horton Tucker is out.
*  This team is playing a back to back.
*  I think it was their fifth game in seven days.
*  So it was the easy end to the it was the easy end to the streak.
*  You don't win this one.
*  I don't know where it ends.
*  And now the pressure probably starts to build.
*  So they have home and home at Brooklyn, then home against Brooklyn are their next two.
*  Then they play at Boston, home, Toronto, at Houston, at Utah, at Golden State,
*  at Denver, at Sacramento.
*  Basically, it's got to be one of these two Brooklyn games unless it would be the
*  upset of the century because the problem with this team,
*  they're they're 30th in every three point category.
*  So it's not like, you know, they're not going to shoot 22 for 45 one night from three.
*  Which means they're going to have to beat you with talent and they don't have any talent.
*  And they just get their asses kicked over and over again.
*  Yeah. And like the where are the wins coming from?
*  Because the schedule has been relatively easy.
*  I think it gets a lot harder as the season goes along.
*  Right.
*  Like think about some of the teams that they've they've lost you.
*  So you lose to the Jazz, which is a skeleton crew tonight.
*  You do that at home when they're well rested.
*  Minnesota's well rested.
*  Utah's not.
*  You already lost to Portland at home where you blew a big lead.
*  You want you lost by like 19 points to Washington at home.
*  So like who's left?
*  You're running out of bad teams because there's like six or seven bad teams.
*  There's like three or four historically bad teams.
*  Then there's like 20 good teams.
*  So if you're not beating, if you're not beating the three or four bad teams at home,
*  you're running out of you're running out of wins and possibilities.
*  And what even as this was going on and once this got into the 20s, this I certainly I didn't do a
*  podcast segment about it, but it felt like it was a bigger story than maybe it should have been.
*  I think one of the reasons it wasn't was because there's no smoking gun to point to here.
*  Where you can say this is why they're in this mess.
*  Like this is a team that picked first, fifth, fifth and seventh the last four years.
*  Right.
*  But there's a little bit of bad luck with with some of those picks.
*  There's no terrible trade.
*  You can't point to one sort of tipping point moment.
*  It's just kind of bad.
*  And what's crazy is if you go through the Pistons just in general,
*  so they made the Eastern finals in 08 and they lost in the Celtics.
*  And that was kind of the end of the Rashid.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't even know that that whole crew that was done 2009.
*  They lost in round one.
*  Since then, they've made the first round twice since 2009.
*  Think how long that is.
*  That's yeah, that's year one of Obama.
*  They've made the first round twice.
*  They lost both of those.
*  What do you think their highest win total was for a season since 2009?
*  Oh my God.
*  Number of wins.
*  What would you guess?
*  I'll go 500.
*  So I'll go 41.
*  All right.
*  Well, that was their second highest.
*  That was in 2019.
*  They won 44 games in 2016.
*  They've lost 50 plus games eight times.
*  This will be the ninth time this year.
*  How many all stars do you think they've had since the 08 09 season?
*  Oh, boy.
*  Let's go.
*  Two.
*  Three.
*  Iverson Drummond made it twice.
*  Blake Griffin in 2019.
*  Do you think they've lost the most games of anyone in the league
*  since the 2009 2010 season?
*  Is that a yes or no?
*  I mean, think about this because Philadelphia spent like five years losing on purpose.
*  Intentionally losing.
*  That's the concerning part about this team is they're not intentionally losing.
*  I'll go with yes, I guess.
*  All right.
*  The answer is yes.
*  They're the only team with 700 plus losses over that stretch.
*  Sacramento second, Minnesota's third, Orlando's fourth and Charlotte's fifth.
*  And the reason I mentioned this.
*  Sacramento, they've turned it around.
*  They have some hope, right?
*  They made the playoffs last year.
*  It's not not as great this year, but at least they're above average.
*  Minnesota.
*  We watched them tonight.
*  I think that's that team's a legitimate finals contender.
*  Orlando feeling great.
*  Franz and Palo looking good.
*  Arrow pointing up.
*  They got some moves to make.
*  They might be a sneaky four seed possibly.
*  And even you look at Charlotte, like they have LaMelo and they have Brandon Miller.
*  Those are at least foundation pieces for something going forward.
*  I look at the trade.
*  We're so when I talked about Cade, would you trade them now and try and just try to do
*  the complete rebuild?
*  Is he a keeper?
*  I guess Cade is the keeper on this team and I'm not even positive he's a keeper.
*  Well, you're mentioning like all these picks, like think of the roster and this might be
*  the issue as well is they didn't draft like, or they don't have anybody on the roster that
*  grew up almost as a role player or came into the league thinking I got to be a role player.
*  Cade's a number one overall pick, right?
*  Marvin Bagley's number two overall.
*  James Wiseman's two overall.
*  Jaden Ivy's fifth overall.
*  Asar Thompson's fifth overall, who I actually do really like.
*  I like him.
*  He's going to be a winning player.
*  Kylian Hayes, seventh overall.
*  Kevin Knox, ninth overall.
*  Alec Burke's even a while back.
*  Twelfth overall.
*  Jalen Durin, thirteenth overall.
*  So I think that's nine guys that got selected within the lottery.
*  They got nine lottery teams.
*  Can you think of another another team that's got nine lottery guys on their roster?
*  And they're still this bad.
*  No, and they were shopping for kind of failed lottery picks.
*  They were at, they're at Costco walking down the aisles.
*  Grab, oh, is that Marvin Bagley?
*  We'll take, oh, Wiseman, we'll take him.
*  I really like Thompson.
*  This is the worst kind of team for him to be on, right?
*  This is, there's no cohesion in this team at all.
*  All the stuff that he does is stuff that, you know, is, is going to work the better the team is.
*  I still believe in him.
*  If I had to do a keeper draft for this team, I might actually take him over Cade
*  because Cade's got that big contract coming up.
*  You know, he's, he's, this is year three for him.
*  You can start thinking about an extension before year four.
*  I, I mean, this is the problem with the NBA right now, right?
*  The Bulls are in this situation now with Levine where they're like, all right, here, take it.
*  And you literally can't trade him now.
*  So I don't know what the answer is with that.
*  And then on top of it, they just spent $80 million in their coach and he just lost 25 straight.
*  And, you know, if it was year five for him, he'd be like, ah, money's going to get fired.
*  But he just started.
*  So I don't know what, I don't know what you do with that either.
*  You're not eating $78.5 million.
*  Now you would think that you have to do something.
*  And I know Troy Weaver like signed that extension last off season.
*  I think that they said was like, he earned it.
*  Yeah, it's a great job.
*  That's right.
*  So he's going to stay unless they want to eat that money.
*  Monte's going to stay like you would think, like you'd think they trade somebody just to
*  make a move or he goes in like with respect last year.
*  I think when Miami was up three, nothing.
*  And he like started throwing chairs and screaming at the players, like at least something that
*  Tom has to do because you're embarrassing the team.
*  And like the concerning part is like you said, it's been 15 years since their last
*  playoff victory.
*  And Bill, like think about the other teams that have lost more in a row.
*  Right.
*  So I think it's just the 2011 Cavaliers, the 2016 Sixers, the Sixers were losing on
*  purpose.
*  Right.
*  So like there was a reason behind that.
*  The 2011 Cavaliers really didn't have time to pivot off of LeBron leaving.
*  Right.
*  Because that kind of came as a surprise and they're like, okay, where do we go from here?
*  Detroit's like had all this time to build this thing.
*  And Troy Weaver has been there for a pretty good amount of time.
*  And there's still like really no direction.
*  Tom Gore has bought the team in September 2011 for $325 million during that stretch
*  when there was just a bunch of teams available.
*  And basically everybody who bought an NBA team in the beginning of 2010, late 2000s
*  got an awesome deal.
*  He is the worst owner just from a success standpoint.
*  This is now a 12 year run of abject failure, but never gets mentioned in the conversation
*  for, hey, who's the worst owner in sports?
*  It's like just from a win loss record, it's Tom Gores.
*  I think you could put him even against like the Cleveland Browns owners and people like
*  that.
*  Maybe the one organization that's gone down since then in money.
*  I don't know how much he could sell it for.
*  I'm not joking, obviously.
*  But yeah, I mean, it's been that bad and I don't know where it ends.
*  And is Monty even going to make a million dollars per win?
*  Are they going to get to 13 wins?
*  That's what he's making.
*  Well, I mentioned this like two weeks ago when you have a bad team and then you overpay
*  your coach.
*  Sometimes that's the worst thing you can do because then he feels like he's invincible.
*  And then the players are like, well, I don't really like playing for this guy, but he's
*  not going anywhere.
*  But the problems are deeper where they built this team.
*  It's like a bunch of guards, right?
*  They took lottery picks on Killian Hayes, Jaden Ivey and Kate Cunningham three of the
*  last four years.
*  All of whom seem like they need the ball to succeed.
*  So just fundamentally, that doesn't work.
*  Then they have all these big guys with in a league where you need a lot of shooting.
*  They traded Sadiq Bay last year for Wiseman, even though they already had Jaylen Dern.
*  It just it feels like they're putting together a fantasy team more than a real team.
*  But when you go through all the weird thing, and this is why I think people haven't really
*  talked about them that much because there's not a lot to say.
*  Like you go year by year.
*  And I can't you can kill them a little bit, but you can't go, oh, my God, that's the
*  stupidest thing.
*  Like in 2020, they took Killian Hayes seven and Halliburton went 12th.
*  Well, a lot of teams passed on Halliburton A.
*  B, a lot of people like Killian Hayes, like KOC, who I think has done a really good job
*  in the draft for us.
*  He thought that was the possibly the best prospect in the draft.
*  And obviously, in retrospect, Halliburton was the pick.
*  I really liked Halliburton that year.
*  Twenty one, they took Kate Cunningham, the first pick in the draft.
*  I was a Moby guy that year, but most people were Cunningham guys.
*  Nobody was like, what are you guys doing?
*  I mean, that was the consensus number one.
*  And then in twenty two, when they took Ivy at five, nobody was going nuts about that.
*  I mean, you could look from a roster construction angle.
*  Shaden Sharple in seven.
*  Dyson Daniels when eight or nine and Sohan went right after that to the Spurs.
*  And you could say, well, why didn't they take a swing guy?
*  I think that if you're going to kill them on anything, it's probably that.
*  Thinking Ivy and Kate could play together because they can't.
*  But even if you think back to that draft, and I remember I was there covering it,
*  everybody thought that Jade and Ivy was going to go fourth.
*  And they kind of killed Sacramento because Sacramento went with Keegan Murray.
*  And that's turned out to be a really good pick because that kid's taking off right now.
*  But, you know, so he kind of slipped and people thought he was a top four player.
*  It was pretty clear that it was going to be Chet Palo and Jabari Smith as the front three.
*  But then you thought, hey, a little gap.
*  It's Jade and Ivy.
*  Then it's Keegan Murray.
*  Sacramento was Keegan Murray.
*  And, you know, so I wouldn't kill Detroit on that either.
*  And like, I actually like Jaylin Duran.
*  I mean, I think Jaylin Duran is going to be a really good player.
*  You can't kill him for Kate because we all would have taken him number one or Mowgli.
*  And then you can't kill him for Asar Thompson, who I think is going to be a good guy.
*  So there's not individual years where you can kind of go at him and say,
*  this is a bad move.
*  That's a bad move.
*  It's just, I guess, the pieces that fit together.
*  And that's the other thing, Bill, just like for a second, like think back to the 2000,
*  you know, I guess 16 team that lost the 26 games in a row,
*  which it looks like they're going to do right now.
*  Like if Smith, Jaleel Okaford, Nerlins, Noelle, Robert Covington, Hollis Thompson,
*  those are the guys that had the most minutes for Philadelphia that year.
*  Like you can tell why that team lost so many games in a row.
*  I like this roster a lot better than that Philadelphia team
*  or that Cavaliers team that lost 26 games in a row.
*  Like the talent here, they shouldn't lose 25, 26 games in a row.
*  I agree with you.
*  Bogdanovic missed a bunch of games and he's their best shooter, but he's back now.
*  You go back and you look at some of the trades they made.
*  You know, they traded Canard and Bruce Brown in some seconds for Sadiq Bey.
*  They traded for Jeremy Grant, right, from Denver.
*  And then, and then they paid them.
*  They, they traded Christian Wood in a second for Isaiah Stewart.
*  Like these ones aren't bad.
*  Getting Bagley and then paying him was probably a mistake
*  because I'm not sure what world Marvin Bagley is a $13 million a year guy.
*  They traded Jeremy Grant, who I think has some value for a 25 bucks pick.
*  That will be in the bottom of the draft.
*  They trade, they signed Olenek.
*  Then they traded him for Bogdanovic.
*  And then last year they held out Bogdanovic instead of trading him.
*  And I think he would add value.
*  They traded Bay for Wiseman.
*  This summer they used their calf space to trade for Joe Harris.
*  You go individually and it's like, none of these moves are like a catastrophe.
*  But the team that they built, the roster and how it makes sense with each other.
*  This is, I don't know if they should have lost 25 games in a row,
*  but it's, it's clearly the worst team in the league.
*  Even the Wizards, you can watch the Wizards and there's going to be a night where Kuzma
*  and Poole are feeling it or they'll get like the random Corey Kispert game.
*  I think it would be really hard for that team to lose more than like 12, 13 in a row.
*  If you can't shoot, it's a little more realistic to me, right?
*  Yeah, especially, and Cade's taken a ton of shots, right?
*  And he's been really inefficient.
*  So that's another issue is like your best player is,
*  and Bogdanovic still might be their best player at this point.
*  He struggled here tonight, which is one of the reasons they lost.
*  And that's probably the one move that I would criticize them a little bit with
*  is Bogdanovic last year when he had a ton of value.
*  He might've been able to get like two first round picks.
*  I would have maybe parted with him last year.
*  And I had said that throughout the entire process.
*  Yeah, you want to get worse, not kind of tread water somewhere near the middle.
*  And I think Bogdanovic had real value last year.
*  I think his value right now.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, if you're going to lose 25 consecutive games,
*  what's the point of having him on the roster?
*  If you're going to win six games all year,
*  what's the point of having him on the roster?
*  Get somebody that's going to help you in the future.
*  Because again, like Bogdanovic, as soon as he can get the heck out of there,
*  is going to get the heck out of there.
*  I threw this at Rosilla on Tuesday about the possibility, like should they just trade Cade?
*  Do you just do a full reboot?
*  See what you got with Jaden Ivey?
*  Maybe give him the car keys.
*  I was thinking about the Spurs for Cade and they have a million picks.
*  And I say, is that even realistic?
*  Because we don't see, we usually don't see in this day and age
*  teams giving up on young point guards like that.
*  I saw it with Halliburton and the Kings, but that was pretty unique circumstance, right?
*  They had a clear Fox Halliburton.
*  They kind of had to pick one of them.
*  But for the most part, you don't really see it.
*  But this is the NBA we grew up with, right?
*  We watched in the 90s, we would watch these high lottery picks just get traded after like a year
*  and a half.
*  I would think about it if I was them.
*  I think it might be a change of scenery time for him because with the extension coming,
*  you just can't extend somebody who can't win anything for you.
