# Are the Lakers Even a Play-in Team? | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [October 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv4reqay-Nk)
*  The Lakers at best without a major trade or the 10 seed at best
*  Yeah, like that fringe playing. Yeah at best because eight teams are gonna be better than them for sure warriors nuggets Grizzlies
*  Clippers sons Mavs
*  Pelicans wolves then on the mismatch on Tuesday Chris Vernon and I you know hyped up the Kings
*  We really like what we saw from them in preseason the moves they made
*  Blazers as of now trying to win games with all the money they spent this summer
*  I you could argue that they should go the other way
*  Trade Damien lowered be worse get higher draft odds in the Victor web and yama race
*  But as of now, they're trying to win the Lakers right now bill you need in the NBA to win today. You need shooters
*  You need wings the Lakers have no spacing no reliable shooters tonight
*  Ten of 40 from the floor from three-point range terrible until that fourth quarter and they have no wings in the scene
*  Starting six foot one Patrick Beverly is a small forward Lonnie Walker a so-called 3d player
*  Even though he doesn't shoot three well threes well doesn't defend well
*  Lakers ownership like they've been questioned why they extended Palinka why Jeannie bus has decided to do that
*  It's right to question them considering the product we saw on the floor tonight
*  They've been questioned or they've been ridiculed why they extended Palinka. I was stunned
*  It's one of those teams when you actually watch it year preseason you listen to podcasts
*  You watch the clips, but then when you actually see the team it had a feel of a team that guys were out
*  And it's like well when they get so and so off the injured list and so and so off the IR
*  And it's like no no this is actually the whole team they started
*  Beverly and Westbrook and Lonnie Walker the fourth and then the five guys off the bench initially were Matt Ryan
*  Gabriel Toscano Anderson Reeves and none
*  There's no help on the horizon
*  There's no free agent who's like gonna be ready in December. This is the team KC
*  I my overreaction on top of your overreaction. I think this is actually the worst three through ten in the league
*  Who has a worse three through ten like even if you go to the bad teams like OKC San Antonio?
*  Maybe Charlotte. I don't know name a team
*  I still might like their three three through ten better you could argue every single player three through ten in the Lakers is
*  Below average if we're just saying like average is what the hundred and fiftieth best part in the league
*  Do they is their third guy in the top 150 you could argue Westbrook Reggie never certainly try it to today
*  Yeah, I mean Ross is maybe like 120 130 something like that. Okay, so let's call West. Let's call him average
*  Yeah, and maybe on a nice day. You could call Beverly average
*  I think he's like an eighth or a ninth man on the right team
*  But it was funny here Reggie Miller do the whole you know say what you want about Russell Westbrook
*  You know, he did average an 1877 last year, you know, he plays with a lot of heart
*  You know the Lakers fans will lie in this guy, but you know, he's out there and he beats to his own drum
*  Played 78 games. Yeah
*  He's got two legs and two arms and a head
*  It's really bad it's just hard to believe because they had their full mid level they had a couple side levels they had the THT
*  Contract that was like 10 million. That was like at least a little tradeable. I just don't know how they didn't do better than this
*  I mean the thing with them is at this point you look at the team what we saw in preseason what we saw tonight and what we
*  Just saw on paper what was kind of obvious all along here a Russell Westbrook and two first round picks deal for Miles
*  Turner and Buddy Hill that helps you that makes you more watchable
*  But that doesn't solve all their issues. It doesn't solve all the shooting problems all the the defensive issues of the wing position
*  so if you're the Lakers you have Russ and I
*  Think I think despite no matter how average or below average this team might be from now until February 9th the trade deadline
*  I think they gotta wait as long as they can to trade Russ
*  Rather than make a panic move for Turner and he'll
*  You gotta find out what comes up
*  You gotta find out what comes up it could be hate word in Rozier
*  And you only might need one pick to get rid of something like that
*  And then you get another one for something else and you make two separate trades
*  And then your team suddenly looks better than
*  Settling now for Turner and healed and maybe you end up getting them for less than one first
*  Maybe it's one first in a bunch of seconds
*  like the Sixers three through ten guys
*  Maxi Tucker Harris Neang House Harold Thiebaud and Melton
*  What a difference I think you could argue all of those guys would be the Lakers third best player
*  Maybe dang verse Westbrook. I don't know but dang
*  But for what the Lakers need sure
*  Celtics, they're a they're three through ten
*  Taken out Tatum Brown Horford smart white
*  Grant Williams Brogdon, then it goes into the Hauser Griffin von lay
*  But all those guys probably would have played for the Lakers today. I
*  I don't know what the moves are. I'm with you though. You can't panic yet. Plus Davis looked great and
*  They're gonna win their fair share. I think to at least not dip too far
*  I don't think they're in danger of being like a 15 and 30 type team
*  No, they'll hang around if those two guys are healthy
*  Yeah, I picked them I picked them to go over because I thought the panic trade was coming sooner than later
*  And I think let's say they start out one and six something like that
*  The difference this year is I think LeBron knows that this title has sailed for this season
*  Which is what leads me to my overreaction my first one
*  So LeBron was 23 to 1 on Fandl to win the scoring title. I
*  Actually think that's a great bet from what I saw tonight because I think he's gonna kind of quickly move into
*  You know what?
*  We don't have it this year. I'm gonna score some points. I'm gonna break the record
*  I'm gonna get my 30 a game
*  I'm gonna try to get to like 65 games and get to 30 to 32 a night
*  They see how fast they're playing they're playing with pace in the fourth quarter if they play with that kind of pace a I don't
*  Know if Davis is even gonna be able to hold up
*  But if they do I do think he's gonna score points. What do you think of that one?
*  I think he we definitely saw him stat padding tonight. That's for damn sure
*  I mean, I think LeBron's smart enough to realize this team's not good enough and
*  Without some major surprise trade they won't be good enough, you know, no matter what they do
*  Turner heels not gonna get him there
*  so if you're LeBron, you're you know, you're thinking about yourself right now and you're thinking about your numbers and your place in history and
*  You get that done and then you reassess next summer and and and that's the other side of it
*  If you're LeBron, you did sign that extension
*  You were not trade eligible this season like even if you decided you wanted out that have to wait until next summer
*  I mean the conspiracy theorist inside of me wonder of Rob Polinka
*  I mean, he's either the worst GM in all of basketball or he deliberately built a roster so bad around LeBron that
*  He's trying to push him to ask out after the season knowing there's no path to winning again with him anymore
*  Like it's one of the two things like this roster is so bad around him
*  If you're LeBron unless you don't care about winning at all anymore you're past that championship chase
*  Like I don't see how you can when you're LeBron or you're still playing at the level that you can it's almost it's disappointing to me
*  In a way Bill that we are at that stage where he's stat padding and he's still not competing because he's still a player worthy of contending for championships
*  He just has the worst three to through to ten around him as you just said
*  Yeah, I made this point last year when curry was making the Warriors around but it's worth mentioning again
*  Just that he kind of did have the pieces for his version of what this curry Warriors team is right now
*  You know like this mix of vets and young guys on the rise you look back at that
*  2018 team that first Lakers team that he was on who's when they did have a lot of
*  oh, yeah, Brandon Ingram and
*  Heart and Lonzo's on there and they had all the draft picks right that every draft pick coming that a lottery pick
*  In the draft that was coming Lonzo's the only one just from a health standpoint that I think you
*  Maybe be worried about but for the most part they had most of those players. I don't see a lot of outs for them
*  I didn't see it before the season. I thought them as a playing team was a great bet
*  I think it was like see the minus 120 or plus 120 was somewhere on even odds
*  But it just I thought I think Dallas is gonna be a playing team the West like their top seven eight if you think New
*  Orleans is gonna be good
*  Which I think we do and if you think Sacramento is gonna be sneaky
*  Which I think all of us at the ringer who follow basketball
*  We all love this Kings team to the point that I'm actually probably scared for the Kings now
*  But I to me the Lakers are the tenth best roster
*  No matter how good Davis is one thing that's on the Davis front is just the trade possibilities with them
*  If if he just looks great for a month
*  Could they look at that as a way? You know what? It's not gonna work with this combo. We won the title
*  We got what we wanted
*  Maybe we send him when we try to rebuild replenish and we could deal with Lebron in the offseason would be the other thing
*  That definitely could be a path that makes sense
*  If we saw what teams were offering for Kevin Durant and granted no deal ended up happening if the Lakers were to put LeBron James
*  On the block or AD on the block before the deadline. Well, it can't be LeBron. It has
*  LeBron it would be AD before the deadline before the deadline LeBron for the summer
*  Yeah, either of those guys on the block
*  You're getting a massive haul in return for them and then suddenly you get this young up-and-coming roster
*  You get your own first round draft pick in 2024
*  You can you know try to hit on that build a young team and try to do it in a way that doesn't involve LeBron making
*  Decisions or pushing for decisions in the front office
