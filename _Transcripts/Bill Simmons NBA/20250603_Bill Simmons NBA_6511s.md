# The Knicks Fire Thibs, Plus a Bill Belichick Debate With Pablo Torre | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU)
*  All right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm recording the top part of the podcast here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=26.36s)]
*  It's about two o'clock Pacific time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=28.36s)]
*  The Knicks relieved Tom Thibodeau of his duties as head coach a couple of hours ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=30.48s)]
*  I was going to have a guest, but you know, honestly, there's a bunch of stuff I want [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=36.24s)]
*  to hit. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=39.8s)]
*  I feel like I can do it in 15 minutes and we're just going to go for it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=40.8s)]
*  I wasn't surprised. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Zach Low came on this podcast in April. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=46.84s)]
*  We did all of our, we did a most intriguing playoff people draft and we got to the hot [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  seat category. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=55.16s)]
*  And this was, I think Zach's first appearance back on my podcast. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=56.48s)]
*  And we had a hot seat category and he had a, I forget who he had. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=60.31999999999999s)]
*  And then I had, I had Tibbs and Zach did like, his like cold body. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=63.36s)]
*  It was like, he got electro shocked and I was like, look, I think there's a chance, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  you know, I don't, I don't know if it's going great. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  And, uh, you know, if they lose to the Celtics in five or, you know, the first [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=75.28s)]
*  round's rocky, whatever happens, I think this is in play. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  And there were, there were reasons I thought that there was stuff that I heard [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=82.96s)]
*  there was stuff percolating around. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=85.72s)]
*  Um, but then they beat Detroit in six. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=87.56s)]
*  They beat Boston in six. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=92.0s)]
*  Um, and you know, Tatum goes down at the end of game four, they're about to win [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=93.8s)]
*  game four, they're going to take a three, one lead against a 60 plus one team. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=97.16s)]
*  Uh, and then they take Indiana to six and they were one of the four teams left. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=101.24s)]
*  Basketball is reignited in New York. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=106.48s)]
*  And the question is, well, then why would you fire your coach? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=108.12s)]
*  Well, I think there's one, two, three, I'm going to give you five reasons. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=110.92s)]
*  I'm going to give you a couple of conspiracy theories as well. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=114.68s)]
*  Just, just for the hell of it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=116.72000000000001s)]
*  Um, five reasons tips got fired. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  Number one, this is an admission that they actually weren't as close to winning [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=121.48s)]
*  the title as maybe you think you were if you were one of the final four teams left. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=127.36000000000001s)]
*  Um, and there's previous examples of this, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=132.32s)]
*  The warriors, uh, in the March accent year before they hired Steve Kerr, where [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=136.08s)]
*  there was a feeling like Mark Jackson took us from here to here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  And now we need somebody to take us from here to here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  I talked about this on my podcast on Sunday with Bannon, Marcella, um, the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  better example and one that I think is weirdly applicable in a bunch of different [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  ways here is the 2003 Pistons who moved on from Rick Carlisle. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  They hired Larry Brown and people were really surprised because Rick [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Carlisle had done a good job with Detroit. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=162.92s)]
*  He's a good coach as we've seen. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  Won a title in 2011. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  He's in the finals this year. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=167.92s)]
*  Ironically beat the next. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=168.92s)]
*  Um, but the question was, did Carlisle take this roster as far as it could go? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  And on top of it, could Larry Brown bring us up an even further level? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, a guy who was intimately involved with that Pistons team behind the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=181.76s)]
*  scenes back when he was very shadowy and nobody really understood what he did or [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=186.16s)]
*  what his role was, was worldwide West William Wesley. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=189.88s)]
*  Um, he, um, was a confidant. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  He's a big Larry Brown guy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=197.04s)]
*  He was behind the scenes with those Pistons guys and all these different [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=198.24s)]
*  ways, still close to a lot of them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying he was responsible for the decision. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm just saying he was there watching the effect of it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=205.12s)]
*  And I find it hard to believe that him and Lea Rose who run the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  Knicks team right now, um, weren't thinking about that specific example. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=211.44s)]
*  When they were thinking, did tips take us as high as we could possibly go? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Is there another level for us to go and what has to happen to get there? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=220.72s)]
*  Did we max out with tips? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  Um, in the case would be season played the starters too much, trailed by 10 [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  plus all the time in the three playoffs areas, as we talked about on my podcast [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  on Sunday, this, this, at some point you are who you are and if you're down 10, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=235.4s)]
*  12, 15 in 75% of the playoff games you're playing, that's a really bad sign that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=239.44s)]
*  you have to always constantly claw your way back. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=244.8s)]
*  Um, and then you got to think about circumstances too. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  You're gifted a Cleveland collapse. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=250.72000000000003s)]
*  Cleveland has home court throughout the playoffs and they won 64 games [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=253.64s)]
*  and Indiana just thumps them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=256.64s)]
*  You're gifted Boston's inexplicable collapse in game one and game two, which [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=258.6s)]
*  I may or may not look at the box scores once every two days, the Celtics in the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=264.2s)]
*  third quarter with a huge lead of game one took 20 shots and 19 of them were threes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=269.08s)]
*  And you just think back to some of the decisions Boston made offensively in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=275.6s)]
*  that series, how slow they played, um, how many threes they took, how they [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=278.96s)]
*  didn't use some of the next weaknesses against them, didn't push the pace, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=283.0s)]
*  didn't constantly hunt Brunson in towns. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=286.32s)]
*  Um, and those two games are just two of the worst losses combined as a loss in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  the history of Boston's franchise. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=293.84s)]
*  Um, and it's going to be a long time before you get over it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  And that's before you get into what happens to take them a game four, but [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=298.64s)]
*  just how they played those first two games was such a gift to the Knicks who [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=301.96s)]
*  then went and grabbed it because they're a tough team and they have a lot of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=305.96s)]
*  talented players. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=308.32s)]
*  You also lose out on Milwaukee and Philly or Orlando gets hurt, all that stuff. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=309.52s)]
*  Um, so a lot of things broken New York's favor and yet. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't think they would have come anywhere close to beating Oklahoma city. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=317.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=320.8s)]
*  So the line for that, uh, finals is I think it's minus 700 right now with Indiana. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  I think, I think it would have been higher if it was the Knicks. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=326.96s)]
*  So at some point you have to have an honest assessment. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=330.24s)]
*  Are we trying to be good every year? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=332.44s)]
*  We're trying to win the title. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=333.52s)]
*  And could we win the title with what we just watched, um, with the coach we have [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=335.56s)]
*  with the way the players responded to them and they obviously looked at it and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=340.88s)]
*  said, we can't, so that's one second reason I think Tibbs, um, who I really [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  like as a coach for the most part. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=350.88s)]
*  And I appreciate how much he cares. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=352.44s)]
*  And you could feel with some of the reactions today, um, the press was really [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=354.36s)]
*  shocked and, and in a lot of cases upset that it played out this way. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=358.44s)]
*  Um, he's an all in all the time basketball maniac, like a real obsessive. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=362.6s)]
*  And he lasted in the next for five years in a player's league, which we'll get to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=367.64s)]
*  in a second, why that's an important number. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=371.0s)]
*  Um, didn't really listen to anybody on lineups. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=373.36s)]
*  Just played his guys as much as possible. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=376.44s)]
*  There was real dissension that you could feel from March on the Bridges stuff was [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  always weird with Mikhail Bridges and him talking openly about playing too many [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=382.32s)]
*  minutes and then, oh, we hashed it out behind the scenes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  That was never a good sign. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=388.2s)]
*  Um, and then you could see as he started to kind of change stuff, change this [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=389.84s)]
*  defense in the Boston series, which were started experimenting with these big [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=396.11999999999995s)]
*  lineups in the third, in the third round against Indiana, because he realized his [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=399.88s)]
*  players couldn't play seven guys against the pace that you could do against, uh, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=403.88s)]
*  uh, with how Indiana wants you to play. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=409.2s)]
*  Um, and then all of a sudden Shamitz out there and the one, right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=411.88s)]
*  And guys that really should have been playing all year. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=416.28s)]
*  And it's just, when you start changing stuff that drastically in, uh, the end of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=418.56s)]
*  May, that's a sign, like maybe you didn't use the regular season to your benefit [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=423.2s)]
*  correctly. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=428.04s)]
*  And I think that's just undeniable. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=428.52s)]
*  We were saying, we were talking about this on this podcast all the time. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=430.44s)]
*  Like didn't understand the rotations, didn't understand the minutes, didn't [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=433.16s)]
*  understand why there was any, no desire to develop a bench at all. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=436.16s)]
*  See of that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=440.56s)]
*  Um, I don't think that helped them once they finally flamed out against Indiana. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=441.8s)]
*  Um, here's the third reason. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=445.64s)]
*  He was there five years, which doesn't seem like a long time. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, you've heard about the 10 years of the, of the remaining coaches, the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=450.88s)]
*  longest running coaches in the NBA right now, 2008, uh, Eric's bolster. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=454.0s)]
*  14 Steve Kerr 2020 Billy Dunovan at, at Chicago, 2020 Tyronn Lue for the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=459.04s)]
*  Clippers and then Mark Dagnon and okay. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=466.56s)]
*  See 2020. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=468.64s)]
*  So three of our five longest coaches showed up in the NBA on those teams five [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=471.40000000000003s)]
*  years ago. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=476.64s)]
*  And all right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=477.32s)]
*  So what is that? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=478.32s)]
*  Our owners and patient. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=479.12s)]
*  This is the league now the players run the league, the players run the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=481.0s)]
*  league more than ever. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  The money is so high and so crazy. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=485.44s)]
*  The turnover and the musical chairs. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=488.36s)]
*  If somebody's unhappy with their situation, their teammates, their coach, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=491.2s)]
*  they're complaining, they have more power than they've ever had. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's just a fact. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=498.68s)]
*  Like this is the dark side of player empowerment. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  You have guys making crazy amounts of money who, if they don't really like [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=503.0s)]
*  their coach, guess who's not going to win that battle, the coach. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=506.48s)]
*  We, the, the, the real eyeopening one for this was Brad Stevens in Boston [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=510.20000000000005s)]
*  because that last Celtics here, he had the team basically. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=514.4s)]
*  Packed it in on him and, uh, and really seemed like they, they just were [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=519.28s)]
*  starting to tune him out and he wasn't reaching them in the same way. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=523.52s)]
*  And Brad Stevens was an incredible coach. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=526.0s)]
*  He only had a seven year run for the Celtics. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=528.16s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=530.48s)]
*  Um, so the run is usually five to seven years, unless you end up with [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=531.88s)]
*  a, a spolster situation, otherwise, we'll shouldn't have a great year this year. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=536.72s)]
*  Either Steve Kerr. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=539.96s)]
*  Um, I think Dagnall will be at OKC for a long, long time. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=541.64s)]
*  Other than that, you know, we're going to hit a point where Doc Rivers is like [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=545.12s)]
*  the seventh most tenured NBA coach. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=548.64s)]
*  And I think he got to Milwaukee five minutes ago. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=551.12s)]
*  I just think this is the league now. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=553.64s)]
*  I think that there's too many outlets for guys to push unhappy buttons. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  The league is hyper covered. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=562.08s)]
*  Every sort of interaction on the bench, um, every quote that comes out of, uh, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=564.1199999999999s)]
*  any sort of press conference, it's just, there's just a big spotlight on anything. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=570.3599999999999s)]
*  And once there's any unhappiness at all, you could feel it blow up. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=573.92s)]
*  And I just think it's, it's really hard. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=578.76s)]
*  The Knicks didn't seem that happy the last four months, I would say. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=580.68s)]
*  Um, and I thought we talked about this on Sunday. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=584.5999999999999s)]
*  I was so interested in that they lost game six and the athletic immediately [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  had this long, long, as Brian Curtis would call it, but now they tell us piece, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=591.08s)]
*  which seemed like it was just in their archives for four days waiting to get [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=596.0s)]
*  published and it had a lot of stuff. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=600.32s)]
*  And the two big losers in that piece were towns and, uh, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=602.2s)]
*  Thibodeau as we talked about on the podcast on Sunday. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  So there was clearly a lot of smoke here and some fire. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=608.08s)]
*  And that's why I wasn't surprised. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=612.2800000000001s)]
*  I, it's why I met first mentioned in April. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=613.5200000000001s)]
*  That's why I mentioned on Sunday's pod. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=615.5200000000001s)]
*  I thought it was 4555 that he stayed and, uh, and now he's gone. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  This episode is presented by state farm. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=621.8399999999999s)]
*  It's no secret that great teams need great teammates. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=624.0799999999999s)]
*  I've been saying this for years. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=626.8399999999999s)]
*  And when it comes to insurance state farm is there to help you find the right [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=628.16s)]
*  coverage for your home car and more, whether you need an in-person or digital [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=631.04s)]
*  assist, they're ready when life hits you with a full court press, get a game plan. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=635.24s)]
*  That helps fit your life. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=640.64s)]
*  Talk to state farm today, state farm with the assist coverage options. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=642.28s)]
*  Are selected by the customer availability and the eligibility vary by state. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=646.84s)]
*  But there's two other dynamics that I think are really important for this. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  Michael bridges. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=655.52s)]
*  He makes $24.9 million next year. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=657.76s)]
*  They traded five first round picks for him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=660.2800000000001s)]
*  He can leave and sign with another team. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  Uh, 12 months, 12, 12 and a half months from now, basically 12, 13 months [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=665.08s)]
*  from now, July 1st, 2026, if they don't sign them to an extension, they traded [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=669.0s)]
*  the five first round picks for him. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=674.4s)]
*  They got the Villanova connection together. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=675.68s)]
*  He's the one that we're pretty positive. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=679.48s)]
*  Wasn't that happy this season, um, talked about the minutes, um, was just an [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=681.4s)]
*  afterthought offensively, they were all like begrudgingly get him involved. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=686.68s)]
*  I thought he had moments in the playoffs, but, um, also moments where he disappeared. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=690.84s)]
*  I can't say they ran a lot of offense for him. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=696.36s)]
*  I thought he was a better offensive player than they used him. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=698.24s)]
*  Um, and then you saw the way he was harassing Halbert and especially in game [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=701.64s)]
*  five, maybe they should have used them a little more like that, but, uh, there [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  was a lot of times where he just felt like the odd man out. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=709.08s)]
*  He felt like the drummer in the rock band or the second guitarist. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=711.5600000000001s)]
*  And, uh, listen, this is a league where players butter each other up. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=715.44s)]
*  Players text each other. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=720.2s)]
*  You should come here. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  Um, people wink, wink all the time. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=722.5200000000001s)]
*  Agents have off the record conversations with people they should be having. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=724.6s)]
*  And the moment other people feel like, yeah, that guy might be a little unhappy. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=728.7199999999999s)]
*  Um, you just, you kind of have to monitor it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=733.64s)]
*  And he's in a situation where I think he's the ideal third piece for [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=737.0799999999999s)]
*  San Antonio, right? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  A team like that in San Antonio is going to have some flexibility and they have [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=742.4399999999999s)]
*  a bunch of picks and it's a team like that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=746.52s)]
*  That could start batting their eyelashes at, at bridges in a different way. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=749.52s)]
*  And for the Knicks, that matters because if he doesn't sign an extension this [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  summer and bets on himself, um, now you're potentially screwed. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=757.48s)]
*  And I think they have to extend him this summer period. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=763.6800000000001s)]
*  They have to keep these five guys together, these four guys and the town's [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=767.76s)]
*  asset, whether they trade it or keep it, they have to keep that nucleus together. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=772.08s)]
*  And he's a huge piece of this. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=776.16s)]
*  So if you sign him to an extension, um, it still helps you this year going forward. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=777.84s)]
*  You know how much money you have and he likes playing with these guys. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=782.6800000000001s)]
*  And obviously I just refuse to believe that wasn't a piece of this. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=785.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying he demanded they fired the coach, but you can tell if somebody's [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=790.12s)]
*  all in on their, on their coach or not, just as a, as a unit, as a player or [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=794.64s)]
*  whatever, and this gives them a better chance to figure out this Bridges thing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=798.4399999999999s)]
*  Which brings me to the fifth piece, the extra dynamics. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=803.68s)]
*  I think one of the things that was, I don't want to say underreported about [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=806.56s)]
*  the next cause people do about it, but there's kind of quietly a lot of people [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=811.48s)]
*  in the kitchen and I'm not going to say there's a lot of chefs in the kitchen. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=817.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=820.6s)]
*  There's Leon and Wes built this team and they work for Dolan, who's the owner [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=820.84s)]
*  who I think really loved the next Renaissance. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=826.5200000000001s)]
*  Um, there's been reports about him handpicking where every single celebrity [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=829.1600000000001s)]
*  and everybody sat courtside every game. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=832.84s)]
*  And I think he really was reengaged, especially when you think like from. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=834.7600000000001s)]
*  2000, 22 or 2002 all the way to, uh, maybe 2021 wasn't a fun 20 years to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=839.48s)]
*  own the next and be named James Dolan. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=847.76s)]
*  So, you know, he's in there and he's got his buddies in there. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=850.44s)]
*  He's typical rich guy owner. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=854.1600000000001s)]
*  So you're worried about him. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=856.76s)]
*  If Jaylen Brunson's dad is an assistant coach, Rick Brunson, and tapes can [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=858.84s)]
*  say all that he wants about, no, no, it was great to have Jaylen's dad there. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=864.24s)]
*  Was it? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=867.6s)]
*  Was it awesome to coach Jaylen Brunson, but also have his dad be your assistant? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=868.72s)]
*  We see so many times in NFL and NBA specifically when you have people, um, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=874.96s)]
*  coaching staff and then somebody leaves and somebody gets the job. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=880.88s)]
*  And then you hear afterwards like, Oh man, that, that wasn't great. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=884.24s)]
*  And that person shanked this person. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=888.0s)]
*  I'm not saying, I'm not saying Rick Brunson shanked anybody. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=889.52s)]
*  I'm just saying that's a weird dynamic. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=893.28s)]
*  When you then add Carl Anthony Towns comes in, his dad is super involved, right? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=895.24s)]
*  You have the Villanova guys as a group. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=899.76s)]
*  These guys have all this history together, right? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=902.2s)]
*  Jaylen, uh, Josh Hart, Bridges. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=904.32s)]
*  So you have all these different little factions. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=909.0s)]
*  You have family members. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=911.0s)]
*  You have people that have real connections to Wes and Leon, like Rick Brunson, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=912.12s)]
*  who's one of Wes's oldest friends. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=916.2s)]
*  Um, he's got tentacles going everywhere and tapes is growing the same in this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=918.5600000000001s)]
*  tips is growing the same in the same way on the boat with a lot of these people. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=923.48s)]
*  But then once that starts to shift, that gets a little dicey, right? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=926.84s)]
*  And the Knicks again are locked into these five guys. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=933.48s)]
*  Once they do that town's trade for Randall and DeFranciso and they break up those [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=936.84s)]
*  contracts and they break up the flexibility of them and trade them. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=941.12s)]
*  Now they're in the town's business. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=944.12s)]
*  Now they have to figure out how are we going to have a team built around five [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=946.36s)]
*  guys, two of whom are the really smart teams are going to attack constantly. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=949.8800000000001s)]
*  See that as well. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=953.72s)]
*  And then, uh, I just don't think that was great. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=954.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think they did a nice job of pretending that everything was hunky dory, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=958.6800000000001s)]
*  but obviously not because Tibbs just came within two wins of the finals. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=962.1600000000001s)]
*  I got fired. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=965.4000000000001s)]
*  So there was some real stuff going on here. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=966.0400000000001s)]
*  There's some conspiracy stuff too. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=969.2800000000001s)]
*  Again, I'm taping this as two 15. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=970.7600000000001s)]
*  It might've already be emotion now, but Johnny Bryant, who I think is an [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=972.36s)]
*  assistant, some people like there, he may, he was named one of the two [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=975.36s)]
*  finalists for the son's job that happened five hours later, Tibbs got [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=979.0s)]
*  fired. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=983.16s)]
*  I'm just flagging it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=983.64s)]
*  Um, there's a J right possibility that I think I floated on my Sunday [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=985.4s)]
*  podcast, the old Villanova coach does he want to coach again? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=990.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=993.48s)]
*  Um, Mike Malone sit in there, but the Johnny Bryant one, I think that's the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=994.4399999999999s)]
*  one I would probably shove the chips toward that bet, whether that's a good [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=998.36s)]
*  idea, I have no idea. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1002.76s)]
*  Um, but if you're trying to get everyone on the boat, rolling one way and you [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1004.4s)]
*  were worried, you're going to lose them. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1008.56s)]
*  The sons maybe. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1009.4s)]
*  Um, the deeper conspiracy stuff is they're about to trade towns for KD and KD [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1010.5200000000001s)]
*  doesn't want to play for Tibbs. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1015.24s)]
*  Again, don't aggregate that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1017.08s)]
*  Do not aggregate that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1018.76s)]
*  I'm just saying it's, if you're trying to figure out why would they fire a [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1020.32s)]
*  coach when they're two wins away from the finals, if they think they have a [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1024.28s)]
*  move coming, did Katie want to play for a certain coach? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1027.32s)]
*  Did Yannis want to play for a certain coach? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1031.56s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1033.88s)]
*  Do not aggregate it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1034.76s)]
*  Just pointing out like maybe a month from now, that part will make way more [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1036.68s)]
*  sense of like, Oh, of course. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1041.4s)]
*  Cause this guy was coming in and he wanted this guy. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1043.3200000000002s)]
*  That's how the league works. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1046.04s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1047.0800000000002s)]
*  Um, my guess would be Johnny Bryant, but in general, like Tibbs lasted five years. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1047.88s)]
*  They were real cracks there in the last year, um, that you could feel and you [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1053.3200000000002s)]
*  could hear when you talk to different people. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1057.48s)]
*  And, um, and I think this is a complicated team as a coach because you [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1059.52s)]
*  have Brunson who took less money to stay with the team, um, at least for two [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1064.6s)]
*  years, whose dad is one of the assistants who I promise you he's not going anywhere. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1070.08s)]
*  Uh, you have this huge towns contract that's got four years left after this, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1074.48s)]
*  after the season that just ended that ends with 61 million. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1079.36s)]
*  Do you keep that? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1082.36s)]
*  How many teams would even want it with the second apron stuff? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1083.84s)]
*  You have all the second apron stuff looming, repeater tack stuff. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1086.6s)]
*  Um, and you don't really have a ton of ways to make this roster better, except [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1090.04s)]
*  for some, some of the lower mid-level exemption stuff and whether potentially [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1095.28s)]
*  they would want to, um, trade Mitchell Robinson, which I would not do. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, and could they be a Yanis team? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1102.84s)]
*  Anyway, there's a lot going on here, but this is the NBA in 2025. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  You can coach a team to a four seed. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  You can win 10 playoff games. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1112.1599999999999s)]
*  You can look back at an Indiana series and go, Holy shit. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1114.6399999999999s)]
*  If we hadn't blown game one, we'd be in the finals right now, which I think is a [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1117.52s)]
*  fair thing for the next to think, um, and you can still lose your job. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1120.56s)]
*  And I have a ton of Nick fans in my life and they're pretty split on this. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1125.32s)]
*  I have some people in my life who are like, thank fucking God, this is Mark [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1129.6399999999999s)]
*  Jackson, Larry Brown all over again. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1133.16s)]
*  Thank God they did this. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1134.68s)]
*  And then I have some other people in my life who were like, this [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1136.52s)]
*  seems super dysfunctional and every. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1138.72s)]
*  The Knicks, we love that team two years ago. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1141.08s)]
*  And since then they've traded for Carl Anthony Townsend. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1143.52s)]
*  They fired Tibbs. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1145.6s)]
*  So in the span of 13 months, we went from, we love this team to what are we doing? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1146.92s)]
*  We'll see where it goes. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1152.84s)]
*  But the most important thing is the Knicks are relevant again. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1153.76s)]
*  Not only are they relevant as a team that wins games and has really good players, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1156.0s)]
*  including one of the best 10 players in the league, but, uh, they're making news. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1159.32s)]
*  And it's not news like this terrible thing happened. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1162.96s)]
*  They did a stupid trade. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1166.12s)]
*  Oh my God, why'd they do this? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1167.76s)]
*  Although I guess why you fire your coaches away to do this, but you know what I mean? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1170.2s)]
*  The Knicks are relevant in a different way. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1173.96s)]
*  And there's a moment here and the best case scenarios, this is [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1175.6s)]
*  Oh three, Larry Brown in the piston. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1178.76s)]
*  So, um, one other thing I wanted to say for, uh, the finals before we, uh, take a [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  break, cause I wanted to make a finals pick really quick and I really wanted to [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1186.48s)]
*  do okay, seeing a sweep, even though I, as you know, I respect Indiana, I've [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1190.72s)]
*  been picking them every round or picking them as a possible upside or saying [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1195.08s)]
*  Pacers and six are the best bets, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1198.6799999999998s)]
*  I think okay. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1203.76s)]
*  See is absolute freaking juggernaut. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1204.36s)]
*  Um, to have a chance to go 84 and 18 or 84 and 19, you were in a list of six, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1207.48s)]
*  seven teams in the history of the league. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1214.08s)]
*  They have a chance to have one of the best seasons ever. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1216.28s)]
*  I don't think any of us would say that's one of the greatest teams ever. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1220.9199999999998s)]
*  Um, there's a performance slash in their prime slash. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1223.6s)]
*  They don't have one of the best seven, eight to nine players of all time at [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1229.0s)]
*  the absolute peak of their powers piece that they don't have, they might have [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1233.28s)]
*  it two years from now, but this is a truly great team. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1236.36s)]
*  And I broke down on, uh, on this pod a few days ago about all the, the way [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1241.48s)]
*  they're just torching people at home in the playoffs, they're eight, one of [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1245.8s)]
*  the playoffs, the one loss was by two points and the other eight wins or like [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1249.0s)]
*  by 233 points, so they just kill teams. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1253.24s)]
*  And I really wanted to pick a final suite because I thought everyone's [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1256.36s)]
*  going to pick okay, scene five. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1260.32s)]
*  Can I zag? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1261.76s)]
*  Um, is there a smart sag actually, but man, you go through the history of final sweeps. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1263.24s)]
*  There's been nine in 78 years. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1269.48s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1271.9599999999998s)]
*  Uh, so you're batting about, uh, 11%. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1273.04s)]
*  I wasn't good at percentages. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1278.4399999999998s)]
*  Last one, 2018 gold state over Cleveland. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1280.1599999999999s)]
*  Think about that series. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1282.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, Cleveland should have won. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1284.28s)]
*  Cleveland could have won. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1286.48s)]
*  LeBron played the best game I've ever seen him play. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1287.32s)]
*  Uh, they squander that one and then ended up losing in four. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1290.08s)]
*  Um, but that first game was pretty close. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1293.6799999999998s)]
*  Like to sweep somebody in the finals, you have to be so much better than them. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1296.6799999999998s)]
*  Uh, 2007, San Antonio over Cleveland's a good example. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1300.8799999999999s)]
*  LeBron drags Cleveland in the finals. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1303.8799999999999s)]
*  The team sucks. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1305.84s)]
*  San Antonio's last really great spurs here of a Duncan's prime. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1307.1599999999999s)]
*  They kill him. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1311.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, two Lakers over the nets. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1312.88s)]
*  Um, which we get, that was the last gasp of that awesome, awesome shack Kobe run. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1316.1200000000001s)]
*  Um, they had just snuck by Sacramento. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1321.48s)]
*  There was some buzz with, with Jersey that maybe watch out Jason kid. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1324.3600000000001s)]
*  And then the, the Lakers just killed him. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1328.32s)]
*  Houston over Orlando, which was an upset. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1330.92s)]
*  Um, Houston wasn't even favorite in this series, but that was yet another, it was [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1333.16s)]
*  like the Jr Smith game, a fluky moment of Nick Anderson missing four free throws [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1337.28s)]
*  in a row and swinging the karma of that series in a way that I've almost never [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1342.92s)]
*  seen anything like that, you don't, you really have to compare it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1347.44s)]
*  It was like the, uh, that first Indiana New York game from a, that was so amazing [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1350.16s)]
*  that I actually think the series just swung. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1355.68s)]
*  Um, so anyway, they ended up sweeping the pistons killed the Lakers in 89. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1357.92s)]
*  And that was a, we have arrived as the new champs. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1362.8s)]
*  The Lakers were on their last legs in a lot of ways. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1366.12s)]
*  They had some injuries. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1368.36s)]
*  I don't think that necessarily should have been a swipe sweep. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1369.3999999999999s)]
*  83 of the Sixers killed the Lakers and then pre merger warriors, um, killed the [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1372.32s)]
*  bullets, the bucks killed, I think the bullets and then, uh, the Celtics that [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  was in 1971 words were 75 and then the Celtics, they're one sweep during the [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1383.8799999999999s)]
*  Russell era was 1959 against Minnesota. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1388.6399999999999s)]
*  Um, in all of those cases, pretty great teams. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1391.8400000000001s)]
*  Um, see that piece 18 series have ended four and one. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1397.2s)]
*  And then if you're talking about like biggest odds and how it played out, um, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1401.92s)]
*  just this century teams that are favored by minus 400 or more Denver, minus 4 30 [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1406.44s)]
*  and 20, 23, they went in five Golden state was almost 1100 in 18. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1411.44s)]
*  They swept San Antonio's minus four 15, 07 swept. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1415.92s)]
*  Lakers were seven to one favorites against the Pistons and Oh four and [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1420.0s)]
*  lost the series four to one. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1423.52s)]
*  Uh, the Lakers were minus seven 50 against the nets and they swept minus 2000. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1425.32s)]
*  In 2001 against the Sixers, they lost the overtime game, won the rest. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1432.1599999999999s)]
*  They said that was four one and then four two against Indiana, which was a dumb line. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1436.08s)]
*  Um, LA was minus 800 and 2000. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1440.56s)]
*  Um, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1444.24s)]
*  I think four to one is the move. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1445.12s)]
*  I hate doing it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1447.08s)]
*  It feels very bandwagoning. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1448.0s)]
*  It's, um, plus one 90. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1449.92s)]
*  I think I'm Fandel. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1451.4s)]
*  I think it's the move. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1452.8s)]
*  I think Indiana gets one of these games, um, and maybe even on the road, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1453.68s)]
*  but they're going to play zone. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1458.6s)]
*  They're going to push the pace. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1460.52s)]
*  They're going to do that thing that they love to do where they, they play [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1461.84s)]
*  with such a fast pace, you get caught up in it and I'm like, we can play this too. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1464.92s)]
*  And now you're on a track meet with them. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1467.84s)]
*  But I think big picture, this is just, this is just, this is just, this is [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1470.16s)]
*  just such an awful matchup for them because, um, their best thing is their [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1474.08s)]
*  guards and the ball handling goal. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1478.6799999999998s)]
*  And okay. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1480.12s)]
*  See that's their best thing is basically making life miserable for guards. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1480.6799999999998s)]
*  That's the number one thing. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1485.6s)]
*  That's how they killed Minnesota with Mike Conley. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1486.52s)]
*  That's why they struggled a little bit against Denver because Yokej [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1489.32s)]
*  basically became the guard. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1492.04s)]
*  Um, but just in general, this is like, okay. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1493.72s)]
*  See, does everything Indiana does way better. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1496.12s)]
*  And this for Indy to win even more than one game, they would have to have [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1499.4399999999998s)]
*  win one of the first two have a game three or game four. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1504.1599999999999s)]
*  Cause okay. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1507.56s)]
*  So he's a little more vulnerable on the road cause they're young. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1507.96s)]
*  We saw that in the Minnesota series, the Denver series, uh, even in Memphis, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1510.24s)]
*  when they fell behind by a 20 plus. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1514.36s)]
*  So I think, I think okay. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1516.84s)]
*  See takes one kind of haymaker from India in the first two games, maybe [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1518.4399999999998s)]
*  fights it off, kills them in the other game, like kills they'll win one of [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1523.32s)]
*  the first two games by like 28 then game three, maybe that's the one Indy gets. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  Come out. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1532.0s)]
*  Indiana is going nuts. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1533.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1534.8400000000001s)]
*  See, he's feeling it a little bit. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1535.1200000000001s)]
*  And he's playing with crazy pace. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1536.52s)]
*  Then okay. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1537.92s)]
*  See, he figures it out and they went in five. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1538.3200000000002s)]
*  So I'm going to say, okay. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1541.68s)]
*  See in five and it's boring, but that's my official 2025 finals pick. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1542.76s)]
*  Uh, I'll be rooting for Indiana because I want this to be a long series. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1551.28s)]

*  Just to figure out when and where this was set. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1662.4399999999998s)]
*  Uh, but I was there like pathetically, like looking at my phone as very serious. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1664.48s)]
*  Journalism was honored and I was like totally distracted. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1670.0s)]
*  So fuck you for that. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1673.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1675.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1675.32s)]
*  You know, uh, ruining the crowning journalistic nomination of my life while being [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1675.84s)]
*  questioned for being a real journalist, which is what bothered me. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1682.8s)]
*  I know, but let's talk about that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1686.8799999999999s)]
*  Cause I didn't feel like I was doing that. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1688.08s)]
*  I was, I felt like I was questioning. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1689.72s)]
*  Is this the table? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1691.8s)]
*  This is the table by the way, where Chris and Van were like, Bill. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1692.3999999999999s)]
*  This is the table. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1696.28s)]
*  This is the table. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1697.12s)]
*  It's like, it's funny. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1697.52s)]
*  We're right into the scene of the crime. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1698.56s)]
*  I was questioning the story more than the journalism, but I think that was, I [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1700.6399999999999s)]
*  think that was probably my disconnect with it was you were doing real journalism. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  That's the point of your show. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1709.72s)]
*  My thing was I thought it was stupid. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1710.9199999999998s)]
*  And well, just like Belichick, like ultimately he's a guy in his mid seventies. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1713.32s)]
*  I guess he's never coaching in the NFL again. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1719.1999999999998s)]
*  At this point, he's dating this 24 year old and I, it kind of feels like he's [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1721.04s)]
*  lost the steering wheel a little bit. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1726.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, you said a number of things that I think are very interesting. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1728.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1731.76s)]
*  And which is kind of why I've devoted a disturbing percentage of my life, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1732.52s)]
*  admittedly to this, like Jordan Hudson. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1736.0s)]
*  Uh, this is a sentence that I'm not proud of saying either, but Jordan Hudson [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1738.1599999999999s)]
*  tweeted or retweeted about me saying, I need a hobby, a new hobby. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1742.32s)]
*  She's not wrong. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1746.36s)]
*  So you, so it was pretty polarizing even within your circles. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1747.76s)]
*  Like, why do you care about this so much on the episodes we did, we've done two [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1751.04s)]
*  of them, uh, in a docu style, you know, way in which I basically unbox journalism [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1754.6799999999998s)]
*  for friends, uh, they made fun of me. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1759.8s)]
*  So this whole thing of like, I, of course I'm here to acknowledge the absurdity of [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1763.52s)]
*  guy who won an Edward R. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1768.84s)]
*  Murrow award for an episode about trans athletes. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1770.32s)]
*  Also being the guy who has like this, uh, you know, the reason I'm like a dog with [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1773.12s)]
*  a bone on this, um, speaks to some of the, some of the things you just said. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1779.04s)]
*  And you, one of the things that I found baffling is that you just depersonalized [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1784.04s)]
*  Bill Balachek into a guy in his seventies. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1788.68s)]
*  I'm like, Bill, you more than anyone else know why Bill Balachek is fascinating. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1791.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1796.72s)]
*  When, why the archetype of him who was the paragon of discipline, privacy, do your [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1797.0s)]
*  job, defensive strategy, public relations, mastery, the guy had in his office at [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1803.1200000000001s)]
*  Gillette sun zoo, the art of war, you know, the war, the battle is one or [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1809.68s)]
*  lost before it even begins. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1814.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1815.64s)]
*  And so just him as this unique archetype in American life, not just sports, but [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1816.04s)]
*  American life that you personally, of course, have a deep understanding of. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1820.64s)]
*  Six super bowls. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1824.84s)]
*  I'm told he's the greatest coach of all time. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1826.4s)]
*  I think he is. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1828.2s)]
*  Well, in that case, we should consider him significant enough to fact check, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1829.16s)]
*  certainly interrogate when it comes to why is he acting the opposite from the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1833.16s)]
*  way that Bill Simmons remembers him? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1838.32s)]
*  Well, I think the thing for me is it felt like you did the podcast for whatever [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1840.08s)]
*  reason. And it's a dopey thing, but I'm the same person who just did a rewatchable [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1844.36s)]
*  episode about out for justice with Steven Seagal. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1848.12s)]
*  I was going to say you did criticize me on a heaven can wait centric. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1850.2s)]
*  I did. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1853.56s)]
*  We're watchable. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1854.0s)]
*  A movie that came out in 1978. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1854.6399999999999s)]
*  So, and also like when I was doing my mail bag once upon a time, when we talked [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1856.76s)]
*  yesterday, it's like, yeah, I used to obsess over a bunch of dumb shit and try [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1860.56s)]
*  to answer questions like this. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1864.56s)]
*  Well, used to? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1865.72s)]
*  Well, maybe still do. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1867.1599999999999s)]
*  We both take stupid things seriously. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1868.6799999999998s)]
*  But I guess the difference here is I felt like you were then dining on it and doing [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1871.28s)]
*  a bunch of things and that the media tour was what bugged me more, which I'm happy [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1876.4s)]
*  to discuss. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1880.1200000000001s)]
*  So I have questions for you. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1880.64s)]
*  One of the questions I have is now now I guess I'm part of the media tour. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1881.84s)]
*  I was going to say, which camera can I break the floor with all the inches? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1885.04s)]
*  Why did it bother you? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1889.52s)]
*  The media tour, the quote, quote, media tour. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1891.24s)]
*  And I can explain what that was even from my perspective, of course. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1893.36s)]
*  OK, because I think if you're going to do a story like this, to me, there's a there's [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1896.28s)]
*  kind of a fun element, right? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1901.6s)]
*  This is like an end of Nicole Smith. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1902.96s)]
*  What was that guy's name? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1905.2s)]
*  If one of your producers can yell the name of that older man in the wheelchair who [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1907.4s)]
*  looked infirm and it seemed like you were so serious about it. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1910.52s)]
*  I was like, why is he treating this like Watergate? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1913.6s)]
*  Ultimately, who fucking cares that this guy is dating somebody who's 50 years [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1916.0s)]
*  younger than him who wants to be on his work emails? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1919.6s)]
*  Is this actually an important story or is this just a fun story to get clicks? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1923.1200000000001s)]
*  I feel like that was my issue. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1927.28s)]
*  And is that fair? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1929.3600000000001s)]
*  You are not alone in that. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1930.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, more than more than fair. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1931.76s)]
*  It's I would say a popular perception of what it is that I've done. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1934.1200000000001s)]
*  If you only consume it via the aggregated and this is now where I sound like you. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1939.4s)]
*  Yeah, I am bothered by the aggregation insofar as it did not lead people towards the [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1943.92s)]
*  story, which was exhaustively reported, setting 11 sources in which we are in fact [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1947.8799999999999s)]
*  laughing at the story and ourselves insofar as of course, part of what I do [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1953.28s)]
*  and taking stupid things seriously is apply real award winning investigative [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1958.28s)]
*  journalism, but to stories that real people find fascinating. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1962.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1965.8s)]
*  So the thing I'm bugged by with you beyond the you're still bugged. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1966.0s)]
*  Well, beyond the credibility. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1970.12s)]
*  But this was like a beef squash. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1971.28s)]
*  Well, we'll see by the end. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1973.36s)]
*  We'll find out together. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1974.56s)]
*  We're going to be fine. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1975.52s)]
*  The thing that I am baffled by more than David Chang coming in, throw some [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1976.32s)]
*  kimchi at you. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1983.04s)]
*  Knives. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1983.76s)]
*  He's cooking in the back. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1984.32s)]
*  He's going to cook for us after this is done. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1985.48s)]
*  Chang is very, is very, I'm sure bothered that the two of us are, are, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1986.8799999999999s)]
*  no, not only is he not bothered, but go get beefing. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1991.8799999999999s)]
*  First of all, Chang loves conflict. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1994.6s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1997.0s)]
*  He's, he's a dark guy with a lot of dark things inside him, but he's also like, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=1997.52s)]
*  you guys should just do a potter. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2001.72s)]
*  It'll be fun. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2003.2s)]
*  But okay. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2003.84s)]
*  So to torture the metaphor here, right? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2004.28s)]
*  The recipe of why I actually wanted to do this. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2005.88s)]
*  It was important. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2009.16s)]
*  It is important. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2010.24s)]
*  So I'll just give you the very brief log line of this. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2011.2s)]
*  Well, tell me the way you think the most important thing is before you do the log [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2013.8400000000001s)]
*  line. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2016.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2016.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2017.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2017.64s)]
*  So you think this is important because you feel like this guy is losing his [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2017.7600000000002s)]
*  marbles, but he's also in charge of a North Carolina football program. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2021.5600000000002s)]
*  I think this is important because Bill Belichick himself is a significant figure [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2024.88s)]
*  and he is the highest paid employee in the state of North Carolina. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2028.92s)]
*  He makes $10 million a year in taxpayer money and also might be making that money [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2033.12s)]
*  back for the school. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2037.88s)]
*  Well, we shall see. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2039.4s)]
*  But I watched a lot of North Carolina football last year, but this, this speaks to [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2041.08s)]
*  actually the real reason why I'm interested is that this is not merely a, wow, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2044.92s)]
*  an age gap relationship story. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2049.44s)]
*  Cause frankly, this is not, my podcast is not a puritanical one in which I'm [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2051.08s)]
*  saying, they should find someone more in their age range. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2055.64s)]
*  That's not what it is at all. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2060.76s)]
*  You're not being the more authority. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2061.72s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2062.84s)]
*  What this is though, is to me a story in which one guy who we understood to be [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2063.6800000000003s)]
*  the actual archetype of one way of living life in America as a public figure. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2069.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2075.56s)]
*  Deeply private. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2075.92s)]
*  Do your job. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2077.52s)]
*  PR, fuck the media is now pivoting after he's thrown out of the NFL bill, as you [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2078.6400000000003s)]
*  well remember, right. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2084.1600000000003s)]
*  And has to launch a half dozen media enterprises that he hands to a woman that [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2086.04s)]
*  yes, he met as we reported on a plane when she was, and this was not known until [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2091.84s)]
*  we reported 19 years old. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2097.32s)]
*  And he says, you're going to be my gateway into public life. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2099.76s)]
*  And then the CBS thing happens. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2104.32s)]
*  And that's when the flood gates open. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2106.4s)]
*  So to me, there is a media story. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2107.92s)]
*  There's a business story. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2109.88s)]
*  There's a college sports story. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2110.92s)]
*  There's a public money story. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2112.2000000000003s)]
*  There's an NFL story. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2113.56s)]
*  The question, by the way, of why didn't the NFL want Bill Belichick? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2115.0s)]
*  What we reported. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2118.92s)]
*  Well, please, I don't want to filibuster the whole time, but like, why do you think [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2120.24s)]
*  Bill Belichick wasn't brought back? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2123.3999999999996s)]
*  He ran his course. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2124.56s)]
*  I think Kraft probably shit on him to the other owners. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2125.3999999999996s)]
*  And the question of if I bring in, you own a team, it's a five billion, six [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2128.3999999999996s)]
*  billion dollar business. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2133.04s)]
*  You bring this guy in who thinks he's better than you, who doesn't want your [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2134.9199999999996s)]
*  opinion on anything. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2137.56s)]
*  People just don't want to do that. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2138.44s)]
*  So what I have been reporting is that it's also, it's also the case that people [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2139.6s)]
*  did not trust who Bill Belichick wanted to bring into their building. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2144.2799999999997s)]
*  And so this question, which you know, you think that was the case a year ago or [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2149.16s)]
*  what we report in the second episode is that I found, I mean, this is there's a [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2153.52s)]
*  thing on the website of the Patriots, Gillette Stadium called a fan camp. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2159.4399999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2165.12s)]
*  And we found Bill Belichick's seats. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2165.56s)]
*  He has a row of seats right underneath the overhang near the 50 yard line. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2168.8399999999997s)]
*  And they're his seats. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2173.56s)]
*  And we found Jordan Hudson sitting there. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2175.04s)]
*  In November, 2021. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2177.32s)]
*  So you could say what the record was a year. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2180.32s)]
*  It wasn't good. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2182.36s)]
*  Year after back Jones. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2183.2000000000003s)]
*  It wasn't good. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2184.32s)]
*  And so what I've been hearing parallel to this is that Newton season. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2185.88s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2189.76s)]
*  I refer to you on how she was to block out the entire 2020s. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2190.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2194.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think about 2020s. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2194.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2196.2000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, parallel to this is that I've also heard that by the end, Bill [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2196.6800000000003s)]
*  Belichick wasn't exactly dialed in, in the way that even people on the Patriots [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2201.08s)]
*  wanted him to be, and I mean from above and below. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2206.72s)]
*  And so the question of, and this speaks to the larger question of Bill Belichick. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2210.24s)]
*  The guy is a football genius without question, without question. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2214.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2218.7599999999998s)]
*  But his coaching tree, right. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2219.2s)]
*  Think about the branches on it. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2222.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2225.2799999999997s)]
*  Who does he got? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2225.68s)]
*  Seriously, who does he have? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2226.72s)]
*  Well, he's does a lot of his own shit. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2227.8399999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of people have gotten jobs because of him. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2230.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2232.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2233.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2234.2s)]
*  But it worked. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2235.0s)]
*  So I don't know what's the criticism. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2235.88s)]
*  But this is the story is that Bill Belichick freed from the NFL in which he has been [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2237.36s)]
*  terrible at picking people around him to support him who could stand on their own two feet. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2242.28s)]
*  And in fact, are these remora fish, right. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2248.36s)]
*  Attached to him and his business. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2251.2000000000003s)]
*  So you don't like third place Miss Maine? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2252.84s)]
*  Well, second runner up, I believe. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2255.1200000000003s)]
*  Second runner up, that's what we say. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2257.28s)]
*  That's what we say in the world of tough loss. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2258.76s)]
*  I was rooting for the betting markets. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2260.48s)]
*  Were there odds? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2263.96s)]
*  I was I was hoping that there would be a Bill Simmons super boost on Jordan Hudson. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2265.4399999999996s)]
*  Same game parley. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2269.9199999999996s)]
*  Same game parley. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2270.7999999999997s)]
*  Could have done her with what other words? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2271.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2272.7999999999997s)]
*  I would have tried that. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2273.48s)]
*  But the question is, okay, this guy who teams already knew to be bad at developing, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2274.2799999999997s)]
*  supporting talent from a just managerial perspective. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2280.8799999999997s)]
*  And let's just, I will name them so you don't have to, right. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2284.9599999999996s)]
*  Matt Patricia, right. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2287.2s)]
*  Josh McDaniels. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2289.68s)]
*  He's terrible. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2290.3599999999997s)]
*  Josh is overqualified, offensive coordinator, underqualified head coach. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2292.16s)]
*  Your guy, Mike Lombardi. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2296.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2298.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, he needed to get this job at Carolina to get a job. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2299.68s)]
*  But that's just people taking care of whatever. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2304.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we know a lot of people that do that. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2306.92s)]
*  No question. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2309.3599999999997s)]
*  Maybe even in the media. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2309.96s)]
*  Maybe even maybe even people that we both know or used to know. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2311.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2315.0s)]
*  Like, so no question. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2315.24s)]
*  But the point is when it comes to Bill Belichick now leaving the Patriots and being [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2317.4399999999996s)]
*  trusted with staffing a building, teams didn't trust who was around him. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2322.6s)]
*  And one of the people who was around him, I'm saying as early as November 2021, and [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2327.4399999999996s)]
*  certainly by the time of the ring camera, which was released in November 2023, but [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2331.8399999999997s)]
*  happened to be taped because again, I took a stupid thing seriously and went to the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2336.4399999999996s)]
*  Airbnb after summoning an army of geoguessers. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2340.68s)]
*  You know what a geoguessers is? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2343.56s)]
*  Like these guys. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2345.08s)]
*  I didn't listen to that podcast. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2345.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2346.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think you listen to either podcast in full. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2347.16s)]
*  Well, I'll say this. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2349.3199999999997s)]
*  Can we just establish that? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2350.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's okay. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2352.2s)]
*  But I just want, I think the disconnect here is I didn't understand part of the [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2354.24s)]
*  point of this podcast is you will investigate something no matter how stupid it is. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2358.08s)]
*  But also I will make the case as to why it's actually worth your time. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2362.2799999999997s)]
*  You think this one wasn't stupid because of all of these things, the case you're [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2366.4399999999996s)]
*  laying out with Belichick. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2370.04s)]
*  My thing is where's the line when you, when you deep dive something like this, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2371.36s)]
*  where's the line where it's like, all right, I probably shouldn't do that [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2377.64s)]
*  versus no, this is fair game. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2380.88s)]
*  Like, let's say Popovich, like Popovich has, I think a stroke, right? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2382.96s)]
*  In October, November. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2386.88s)]
*  And then it's like, is he coming back? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2388.44s)]
*  He's not coming back. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2389.68s)]
*  If you would just dove into that, why aren't they telling us the truth about [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2390.84s)]
*  Greg Popovich? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2393.76s)]
*  You could have done good journalism about it, but is that a story you would want to [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2394.44s)]
*  do? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2397.16s)]
*  I would say no. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2397.4s)]
*  And we have it, incidentally, although there have been rumors that I think both. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2398.52s)]
*  So I think this is an important distinction, actually. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2401.76s)]
*  And I thank I thank you for letting me articulate what journalism even is [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2403.96s)]
*  anymore. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2407.2400000000002s)]
*  Because you're right, like the Columbia School of Journalism might not cosign [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2408.92s)]
*  everything I'm doing from a just topic selection perspective. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2411.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2414.5600000000004s)]
*  But that's why I launched this independently. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2414.96s)]
*  You know, like I wanted to pick the stories and investigate the stories and prove [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2417.84s)]
*  that these stories, according to my own curiosity and journalism, were worthwhile. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2422.7200000000003s)]
*  So Popovich, for instance. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2426.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that I don't think that private medical records for a sick [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2428.3199999999997s)]
*  man alone justify a deep dive, multi-part investigation. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2433.6s)]
*  I would agree. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2438.3599999999997s)]
*  But give every other ingredient that we've been talking about with the Bill [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2438.96s)]
*  Balachek story in there. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2442.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, I want to make a docu style treatment of something that [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2443.7999999999997s)]
*  legitimately, I think, has connections to real stories that we've been covering [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2447.72s)]
*  without full knowledge for years. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2452.7999999999997s)]
*  And so a parallel one to this, by the way, and I'll bring it up because people [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2455.2s)]
*  have criticized me for it as well, is the question that was at the heart of the [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2458.68s)]
*  whole Stephen A. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2461.96s)]
*  LeBron beef. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2462.96s)]
*  That was the that was the other time I felt like. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2464.56s)]
*  So to me, I don't should. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2469.24s)]
*  Because to me, that's about Kobe's widow and maybe decisions that she made at the [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2471.2799999999997s)]
*  funeral. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2475.48s)]
*  And why are we talking about this? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2476.0s)]
*  Well, I think to get to that impression, you got to explain why it's plausible [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2477.8s)]
*  that that might be the takeaway from any understanding of this beef between Stephen [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2482.92s)]
*  A. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2487.0800000000004s)]
*  LeBron. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2487.1600000000003s)]
*  What really happened. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2487.8s)]
*  And so to me, like what I like to do is because I know that, you know, lots of [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2489.1600000000003s)]
*  stuff you don't say into a microphone. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2493.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2495.32s)]
*  Me too. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2496.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, you're doing the curious thing. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2496.6000000000004s)]
*  And, and it's important for me to use this network of strange weirdos that I've [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2498.5200000000004s)]
*  gotten to know famous people and GMs and owners. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2502.5600000000004s)]
*  And you do know a lot of weirdos. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2505.84s)]
*  My role with that's over. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2507.96s)]
*  I mean, I started sports illustrators, a fact checker. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2509.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2511.0800000000004s)]
*  I've collected since then through ESPN and otherwise, a bunch of people who, for [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2511.48s)]
*  some reason, trust me. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2515.48s)]
*  And what I want to do is take these nuggets that you both, you and I both find [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2517.6s)]
*  fascinating. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2521.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2522.2000000000003s)]
*  And turn it into reporting in so far as I can actually report them out. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2522.6800000000003s)]
*  And so the LeBron thing, LeBron not being at Kobe Bryant's memorial, right. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2527.2000000000003s)]
*  On paper in isolation as an aggregated headline is so beyond the pale, right? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2532.04s)]
*  Like it's bad taste. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2538.28s)]
*  Anybody can mourn how they wish. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2540.04s)]
*  And all of that is true, right? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2542.28s)]
*  On some level in isolation, that's true. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2543.84s)]
*  But to me, the story was, wait a minute, how is it that the most public [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2546.2000000000003s)]
*  celebration of a man's life at Staples Center live Beyonce, Jimmy Kimmel, right? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2550.6000000000004s)]
*  Every celebrity, every, it was a royal, it was a state funeral. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2558.28s)]
*  And so the question of, well, not so there was reporting that he was there. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2562.8s)]
*  And there was reporting specifically that he was there. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2565.6400000000003s)]
*  That was strange because no one could provide any indication that there was [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2567.96s)]
*  consensus around it. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2572.44s)]
*  It was all very confusing. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2573.56s)]
*  So the hook for you is you felt like this was a piece of the Steven A. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2575.2s)]
*  LeBron thing. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2579.2400000000002s)]
*  It was a thing that everybody was arguing about in public, but no one had reported. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2580.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2584.28s)]
*  And so I was like, I'm going to report this out. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2584.68s)]
*  That's when you're like, that's how it feels like an episode for me. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2586.7200000000003s)]
*  And in the episode in full, just to be very clear on my show, I do explain all of [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2589.68s)]
*  the context and the reasoning such that people who are skeptical about my ethics or [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2594.6s)]
*  my motives understand why I think it's interesting. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2599.2s)]
*  And all I can do is hope that they find it persuasive. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2602.48s)]
*  And if they don't, well, the ethics are one thing because you're doing real reporting. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2604.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2609.44s)]
*  The motives are where you open yourself up a little bit because from afar, somebody [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2610.2s)]
*  could look at and go, you're just doing this because you want clicks. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2615.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2617.88s)]
*  So, right. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2618.16s)]
*  I think I'm sure you've heard that. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2618.68s)]
*  But Bill, I think everybody who's ever made something online has heard that. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2620.2s)]
*  True. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2624.64s)]
*  It's like, unfortunately, the death of the classifieds in newspapers, the death of the [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2625.04s)]
*  cable bundle in television has led us as independent media people to have to subsist [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2629.04s)]
*  by basically putting onto an altar. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2634.7999999999997s)]
*  Your content and hoping that the sun god that is the algorithm shines upon us. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2638.92s)]
*  The algorithm is getting worse. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2644.16s)]
*  It's and it's worse. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2645.4s)]
*  And so to me, it's like, yes, we have to play the game. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2646.88s)]
*  And it's not look, it's not Hollywood where it's one for me, one for you. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2649.36s)]
*  That's not what I'm doing here. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2653.7999999999997s)]
*  I believe in every episode to a degree that is almost disturbingly sincere. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2655.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2661.0s)]
*  But to me, the whole game here is if I'm going to do a Peabody Award nominated [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2661.72s)]
*  episode about why it is at the end of their lives on death row, all of these [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2666.72s)]
*  sports fans spend their last words, literal last words, shouting out their [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2671.64s)]
*  favorite sports team, which leads us to an episode in which we go to a super [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2675.6s)]
*  max facility in Texas and a man named Charles Flores who was unjustly sentenced [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2679.56s)]
*  because of police hypnosis ends up being the character like that's not going to [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2684.84s)]
*  be as popular as the Belichick stuff or the LeBron stuff. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2690.44s)]
*  You're doing the Belichick stuff to get people to listen to the that's we need. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2693.84s)]
*  That's how I feel with the Star Wars rewatchables setting up out for justice. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2699.12s)]
*  I just want you to acknowledge that you just compared my Peabody nominated [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2704.36s)]
*  journalism to your Star Wars rewatchable. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2707.96s)]
*  Note it. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2712.88s)]
*  I'm a Star Wars fan. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2713.56s)]
*  So I have. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2714.8s)]
*  No, I get it. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2715.6800000000003s)]
*  It's a one for us, one for you. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2716.28s)]
*  But it's not even specifically just that because it's not, look, you know, I'm [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2717.44s)]
*  trying to think of the Hollywood example. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2722.08s)]
*  Gosh. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2724.6400000000003s)]
*  But wait, are there, I mean, are there ideas you went down the road with and you [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2725.1600000000003s)]
*  backed off for whatever reason there must have been, right? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2728.96s)]
*  So what are the reasons you back off? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2731.4s)]
*  Because I don't think I could get it on the record. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2732.88s)]
*  I don't think I could report it. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2734.8s)]
*  I don't. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2735.7200000000003s)]
*  So even more troublingly, I think the question of like, what is journalism today? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2736.2s)]
*  To me, the fundamental question that the difference and key distinction between [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2740.68s)]
*  gossip and journalism is that we are definitively saying we have reported this [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2745.68s)]
*  and we believe based on all of these sources and facts and bits of research, that [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2751.84s)]
*  it's true. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2757.56s)]
*  It's not, I heard this thing might be true, might not be. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2758.7200000000003s)]
*  No, we are rigorously investigating something in order to say. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2761.8s)]
*  We are here to publish this as a check. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2766.12s)]
*  Then you're reporting and you're trying to determine these things are true. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2769.08s)]
*  So the things that are true are teams backed off from on the NFL, partly because [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2775.2400000000002s)]
*  of this weird Jordan Hudson situation. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2780.6s)]
*  You believe they were aware of this, had questions about the Ring Cam video. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2782.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think they knew necessarily that she was at a game in November of 2021, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2788.76s)]
*  but I do know that lots of people around the Patriots knew that, that she was [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2793.44s)]
*  around. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2797.96s)]
*  See, I would say the thing that was more, I'm not to sidetrack you, but the thing [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2798.64s)]
*  that was more troubling with Belichick was the way he was doing that job. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2802.16s)]
*  And I've talked about this on the pod where he's basically doing everything at [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2806.6s)]
*  some point because of your age does not become sustainable. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2809.8799999999997s)]
*  Correct. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2812.68s)]
*  And he's trying to do all the draft, all the free agency, every single aspect of [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2813.08s)]
*  everything. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2816.68s)]
*  And the proof that he couldn't do that was in all the moves from basically like [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2817.7599999999998s)]
*  2017 on with the roster, the draft picks, the free agent signings. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2822.36s)]
*  It just felt like, and that was, I still felt like he was an excellent coach. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2827.2000000000003s)]
*  But the other stuff was sub-marine and the coach, which was him. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2832.4s)]
*  And this is why I think this is a story. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2835.52s)]
*  So I should say this on our call and we're going to jump around here. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2838.2400000000002s)]
*  So forgive me. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2840.84s)]
*  But like when you called me and saying, you should come on my show, I reminded [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2841.36s)]
*  you that I emailed you. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2845.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2847.36s)]
*  So the media tour, just to close the loop on that briefly, I responded to [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2847.76s)]
*  incoming requests because people found the story fascinating because the New York [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2851.48s)]
*  Times, Vanity Fair, certainly every, you know, NBC, good morning America. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2855.68s)]
*  Everybody wanted a piece of this story. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2862.32s)]
*  I mean, I'll check them out. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2864.32s)]
*  Well, it's great. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2865.44s)]
*  But it actually seemed like some people just took the story and didn't credit [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2866.16s)]
*  you for the reporting. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2869.32s)]
*  Also that. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2870.4s)]
*  Also that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2871.52s)]
*  I thought that was an interesting wrinkle to it where you started the ball rolling [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2871.84s)]
*  and then it just became its own story, but people would have mentioned the [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2875.64s)]
*  podcast. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2878.88s)]
*  So part of what's weird about doing investigative journalism in this way on a [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2879.48s)]
*  podcast is that people sometimes just assume that I am also simply aggregating. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2882.8s)]
*  And so they're just facts that are exclusive to my reporting that people just [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2888.04s)]
*  started reprinting in papers of record. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2891.04s)]
*  And I'm like, this is strange. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2893.52s)]
*  Again, I asked for it. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2896.32s)]
*  I'm doing podcast investigative journalism, but it's not, it's, it's, it's [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2897.32s)]
*  been funny to watch how that stuff gets in the way. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2902.28s)]
*  That's the last seven, eight years thing. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2903.96s)]
*  You think so? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2905.88s)]
*  I do. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2906.56s)]
*  I do. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2907.76s)]
*  I think that's a, I think social media plays a big part of that. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2908.32s)]
*  The Apple news where, you know, people just click on, Oh, what's that story? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2912.8s)]
*  And like some pick a generic magazine and they basically just have the bones of a [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2916.88s)]
*  story. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2920.7599999999998s)]
*  I think AI grabs some of the stuff too. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2921.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, I know, I know that all of this feels harder to, uh, fact check. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2923.68s)]
*  And so fundamentally for me, the question is what am I fact checking? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2929.0s)]
*  Is it interesting? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2932.64s)]
*  Can I solve this mystery? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2933.56s)]
*  Can I advance public knowledge? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2934.64s)]
*  Even if that knowledge is mostly interesting to sports fans who take [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2936.16s)]
*  sports very seriously, but politics are like this, by the way. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2939.96s)]
*  So there are lots of Trump stories for instance, where the story [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2943.52s)]
*  itself is deeply stupid. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2945.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2947.88s)]
*  Like the actual thing happening is stupid, but if you consider the people important, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2948.3599999999997s)]
*  you're like an interesting development in our understanding of this very [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2952.7599999999998s)]
*  significant American. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2956.4s)]
*  And that's my perspective on how sports is both smart and stupid. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2958.0s)]
*  And you know, this, your building that is premised. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2961.56s)]
*  On your empire doing something very similar to that. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2966.0s)]
*  So I still am staring at you right now. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2969.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I mean, that is a great one. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2971.0s)]
*  I feel, I feel many great Americans gazing upon me as I try to figure out, am [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2973.0s)]
*  I doing something that is worthy of attention or cravenly seeking it because [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2977.6s)]
*  I'm a creature of the internet who wants the algorithm to love me. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2982.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2986.64s)]
*  I am not unself aware about the way in which it's really hard to disentangle [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2987.0s)]
*  those two premises. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2990.8s)]
*  But what I told you in the email was like, Bill, I think you'd be uniquely [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2992.96s)]
*  qualified to have a view on this. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2997.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's because of everything we've gotten to, unfortunately, because at this [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=2998.8s)]
*  table, while talking about heaven can wait, you said I was pretending to be a [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3003.36s)]
*  journalist. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3006.96s)]
*  So that's not what, you know what I meant though. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3007.92s)]
*  I, I'm just making fun of you. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3010.2400000000002s)]
*  My thing was if you were approaching it like this was like important journalism [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3011.76s)]
*  and I just didn't feel like it was. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3016.2400000000002s)]
*  But do you understand though? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3017.6s)]
*  Why the story is, that's why I wanted to talk to you about it. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3019.16s)]
*  So I get, I get why you're doing what you're doing, but you have to understand [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3022.2s)]
*  how I was seeing it where it was like, it just seems like you're thirsty and [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3025.8s)]
*  you're trying to get quicks and then doing a bunch of interviews about the [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3028.96s)]
*  podcast. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3031.0s)]
*  So, and I like Belichick and there's a small piece of this that felt a little [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3031.64s)]
*  mean to me because I don't know what's going on with him. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3036.2799999999997s)]
*  Cause that's, that's over here. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3038.36s)]
*  Shall we talk about what's over here? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3039.96s)]
*  I think we should. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3042.04s)]
*  I think this is kind of alarming how this has gone for the last couple of months. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3043.08s)]
*  And again, I mean, obviously I'm a lifelong Patriot fan. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3047.88s)]
*  I've really admired everything he's built and stuff and something about this [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3052.16s)]
*  makes me uneasy. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3057.96s)]
*  I think this is really weird, which I guess is the whole point of why you did [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3058.84s)]
*  the podcast. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3062.2s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3062.8s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3063.72s)]
*  But I think there's other stuff that was weird that happens in sports where I'm [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3064.2799999999997s)]
*  like, eh, maybe leave that on the side. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3067.7599999999998s)]
*  So the question is whether, but you're making the fact that he's the highest [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3070.4s)]
*  paid employee in North Carolina. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3074.92s)]
*  Like those, all right, maybe. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3076.36s)]
*  But what if I told you now again, not to quote 30 for 30, you know, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3078.0s)]
*  language back at you. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3081.76s)]
*  What if I told you that Bill Belichick's own family has been deeply concerned [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3082.5600000000004s)]
*  about this? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3086.6800000000003s)]
*  What if I told you that his inner circle of actual coaches on staff, including a [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3087.6000000000004s)]
*  certain Mike Lombardi is deeply concerned about Jordan Hudson and her [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3092.6000000000004s)]
*  presence in the building. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3096.84s)]
*  Who's the one Edelman or Gronk? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3097.7200000000003s)]
*  One of those somebody said on a pod. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3099.0400000000004s)]
*  They've all somebody, somebody who was kind of in the circle. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3101.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3105.1600000000003s)]
*  Talked about it being concerned. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3105.5600000000004s)]
*  I thought that was, and then there was some Instagram stuff too, with, uh, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3107.6800000000003s)]
*  who is it like somebody's wife or somebody's the people around Belichick [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3112.0s)]
*  professionally, personally, as well as the administrators at North Carolina. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3116.1600000000003s)]
*  Their life behind the scenes has been shaped, reshaped, blown up by having to [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3121.2400000000002s)]
*  deal with Jordan Hudson. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3127.5600000000004s)]
*  And when they hired Bill Belichick to this job, they thought they were getting [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3129.0400000000004s)]
*  new England, Bill Belichick. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3133.36s)]
*  They got, I cannot stress this enough, something like the exact opposite when it [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3135.36s)]
*  comes to PR in this way is now the thing we're stressed out about this guy who [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3140.48s)]
*  could handle the media alone by saying nothing has this person who's on tape at [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3145.72s)]
*  CBS. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3151.04s)]
*  And I can tell you, by the way, I don't know if I've made enough of a deal on my [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3151.52s)]
*  own shows about this, wherever she goes shows. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3154.52s)]
*  Well, what I'm trying to say is wherever an episode, okay. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3158.44s)]
*  I didn't know there was a show. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3162.76s)]
*  I was doing a spin off. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3164.6s)]
*  That's just me, me stalking. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3166.3999999999996s)]
*  How about Tori finds out what life is like in jail? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3170.96s)]
*  That'd be good for algorithm. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3173.08s)]
*  Yeah, it would. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3174.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3174.96s)]
*  And ironically, it would work. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3175.44s)]
*  But I don't want to do that. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3177.72s)]
*  But what I'm saying is every time she shows up at an interview with Bill, like [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3179.3199999999997s)]
*  what she did on the pivot podcast. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3184.12s)]
*  Like, I'm so deep in the lore here. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3185.9199999999996s)]
*  So forgive me if I'm just like. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3187.2799999999997s)]
*  Part of what happened after my reporting was that North Carolina had to clarify. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3189.7999999999997s)]
*  She doesn't work for us. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3193.7999999999997s)]
*  She's not going to be around here. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3195.8399999999997s)]
*  She is only handling Bill's personal stuff. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3197.68s)]
*  And I ask you, right in this era, can there possibly be a distinction between [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3200.72s)]
*  Bill Belichick person and Bill Belichick, the face and head of North Carolina [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3206.52s)]
*  football? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3213.2s)]
*  Like, how can you, when you're promoting a book in which, nope, that's Bill over [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3214.56s)]
*  here. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3218.2s)]
*  Of course, it's all it's also Bill Belichick, the North Carolina representative. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3219.3199999999997s)]
*  And so the idea that there is any sort of dividing line, some wall between the two [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3224.2799999999997s)]
*  is part of the farce. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3229.48s)]
*  And when it comes to her in interviews, what I was trying to say is everywhere she [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3231.2s)]
*  goes, CBS, these media ventures behind the scenes over that off season at NFL films [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3235.64s)]
*  and not in New Jersey. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3240.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3241.7599999999998s)]
*  All of the. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3242.2s)]
*  Blew up the hard knocks deal. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3242.56s)]
*  Everywhere she goes, there is a trail of wreckage that suggests that the man who is [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3244.6000000000004s)]
*  basically undefeated against the media and press conferences is not only losing the [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3248.6400000000003s)]
*  public relations war, he is self-destructive and he hasn't coached a game. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3253.36s)]
*  And so behind the scenes, all of these people are like, again, family coaches, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3259.52s)]
*  people around the building that hired him. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3263.7200000000003s)]
*  And again, the chancellor at Carolina wanted him, AED, Bubba Cumming, Bubba [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3266.1200000000003s)]
*  Cunningham did not. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3270.88s)]
*  That's his actual name. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3272.96s)]
*  His real name is Bubba Cunningham. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3274.1600000000003s)]
*  It's a bit on the nose. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3277.1200000000003s)]
*  Sounds like a movie script about Belichick and AED Bubba Cunningham. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3277.8s)]
*  A lot of the story is on the nose in terms of like, wow, it's really like that. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3281.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, yes. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3285.36s)]
*  So there is a power struggle, but it goes back to the last couple of years of the [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3286.28s)]
*  paths when it felt like the wheels were starting to come off a little bit and they [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3289.7200000000003s)]
*  bring in Jared Mayo and, um, craft anoints Mayo is the successor. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3293.88s)]
*  And he's still on Belichick staff and it seems like it's going to be one year, two [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3300.24s)]
*  years, three years, whatever it is. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3304.7599999999998s)]
*  And Belichick stops talking to Mayo basically by all reports and it's just [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3306.2799999999997s)]
*  super weird. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3310.36s)]
*  And at the same time, apparently he's with this Jordan Hudson, but these are [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3312.08s)]
*  the things that are all happening outside of public view. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3316.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3319.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3320.36s)]
*  When craft says, but I think it got, I think it was weird with them. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3321.8s)]
*  And look, I mean, this Wickersham wrote about this in 2007. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3324.7599999999998s)]
*  I got mad at my podcast about that because we're protective about the paths. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3329.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3332.2799999999997s)]
*  And I get that Wickersham's reporting was dead on. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3332.52s)]
*  I've had them on many times to talk about it, but, um, the Garoppolo thing, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3335.12s)]
*  Alex Guerrero, there were all these things, craft versus Belichick, all of [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3339.44s)]
*  these things are people were like, there's a problem, there's a problem. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3343.68s)]
*  And everybody was like, we're fine. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3346.24s)]
*  We're winning. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3347.48s)]
*  We're fine. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3348.0s)]
*  And then it all leads to the dynasty and Belichick writing a book where he [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3349.04s)]
*  doesn't mention craft and also the Apple TV documentary. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3352.8799999999997s)]
*  That's what I meant to die. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3355.48s)]
*  It's called the dynasty. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3356.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3356.7999999999997s)]
*  That Apple documentary. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3356.92s)]
*  So the public relations war, right? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3357.96s)]
*  There's craft, there's Belichick. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3361.56s)]
*  Now there's Jordan Hudson. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3363.16s)]
*  There's everybody trying to control a story that has been deeply [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3364.36s)]
*  embarrassing for everybody involved. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3368.08s)]
*  And it reminds me of something that Seth wrote in his book. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3369.76s)]
*  Seth quotes, um, Bob craft saying, Bill Belichick was an idiot savant. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3372.12s)]
*  And I believe that the more I learn about Bill Belichick outside of football, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3379.56s)]
*  there is this notion of a guy who is a total genius at football, who has [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3384.7599999999998s)]
*  proven in terms of who he surrounds himself with the decisions he makes, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3389.7599999999998s)]
*  how the people around him are afraid to deal with him, even as they are [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3394.04s)]
*  literally in the same room, watching Jordan Hudson rolling their eyes. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3398.7599999999998s)]
*  Some of the coaches on staff. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3403.08s)]
*  Uh, I believe that there is a great deal of this man being a genius and [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3404.9599999999996s)]
*  also a fool. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3411.2400000000002s)]
*  And if that feels rude because Bill Belichick is someone you revere, I [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3412.2400000000002s)]
*  just ask you to do this thing. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3416.96s)]
*  Revere strong. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3418.1200000000003s)]
*  But, but Jordan Hudson is trying to do this thing where it's like there's [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3418.84s)]
*  personal bill and professional bill. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3421.6800000000003s)]
*  And for right now, I will do the same. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3423.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3425.84s)]
*  Football bill, genius, personal bill, utter super fund disaster. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3426.36s)]
*  And that's what the story is. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3432.76s)]
*  Well, you could feel some of it last year with all the, with all the [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3434.88s)]
*  media stuff that he did where all of a sudden he was on like five, six [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3438.12s)]
*  different things. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3441.1600000000003s)]
*  Any of it good in your view? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3441.52s)]
*  I thought there was some inside the NFL stuff that was interesting, but [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3448.04s)]
*  for the most part, he seemed to me, this is a problem. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3453.48s)]
*  A lot of times when coaches do media for a year or two years, they don't [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3456.52s)]
*  really want to say anything because it might be coaching again. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3459.6s)]
*  And I thought, I thought he was very safe. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3461.96s)]
*  Which was, we talked to him about a podcast. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3464.32s)]
*  My, my fear was. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3466.0800000000004s)]
*  Are you going to be too safe? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3468.7200000000003s)]
*  Cause we've seen that over and over again with people. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3469.92s)]
*  That's why Doc Rivers was amazing to have on pods. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3472.2000000000003s)]
*  Cause he didn't know if he was coaching again or not, but he still said shit. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3474.5600000000004s)]
*  He still was like the doc that you would hang out with if you weren't doing a pod. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3477.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3481.6400000000003s)]
*  I never felt totally that way with Belichick. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3481.96s)]
*  What I've been told from people who work for me, I mean, at this point, I'm [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3485.2000000000003s)]
*  talking about a half dozen, I mean, I'm talking about a half dozen people who [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3488.76s)]
*  have done a lot of work for me, and I'm talking about a half dozen humans that [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3492.84s)]
*  dealt with Bill and Jordan together at these media ventures, right? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3497.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3500.52s)]
*  I mean, I talked to 11 sources in total, but I'll be more specific to these media [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3501.8s)]
*  things that launched last off season. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3504.76s)]
*  They explicitly encountered Bill Belichick and Matt Patricia using the [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3508.48s)]
*  media to audition to get back into the NFL and they were deliberately de facto tanking. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3513.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it was so good why Bill Belichick in the pre-production meeting was one thing. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3518.7599999999998s)]
*  And then on Mike, he was so bland as to destroy the very premise of why they [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3524.88s)]
*  were paying him all of that money. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3531.56s)]
*  And it was very clear by the end, he and Jordan Hudson had a plan for what this [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3533.32s)]
*  was going to be and throughout that. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3537.2s)]
*  It was, it was so bad as to, I mean, be admitted by the people who were [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3540.6s)]
*  talking to them about this idea. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3547.16s)]
*  Like talking to them now, they all know this was disastrous. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3548.7599999999998s)]
*  And in fact, they found it fascinating that like Peyton Manning's not having [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3552.64s)]
*  Bill Belichick back. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3555.52s)]
*  That was just announced this past week. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3557.0s)]
*  I thought he was bad on the Manning cast. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3558.7599999999998s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3560.56s)]
*  He's off now. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3561.08s)]
*  Where he was good was when it was talking about in the past, when he could talk [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3561.7599999999998s)]
*  about like LT, Ed Reed, and that's when he really opened up because those guys were [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3565.6s)]
*  retired and they weren't somebody he would potentially be coaching or coaching [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3569.7599999999998s)]
*  against, which I thought was planned. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3572.64s)]
*  And then there was this guy who was a long snapper, monologue Bill Belichick, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3576.2s)]
*  the guy who loved the minutia of like, Oh, wait a minute, a left footed punter. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3580.12s)]
*  He's charismatic almost, right? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3585.3999999999996s)]
*  The stuff of the specifics and the history of football he's so good at. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3587.8399999999997s)]
*  But what we saw was a guy using the media to get back into the NFL. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3593.64s)]
*  And now at Carolina, openly using it. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3597.52s)]
*  Oh, I mean, so I would, I would say even frustratingly and almost [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3600.68s)]
*  he was entrusted as the host of shows in one case with Matt Patricia as his [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3605.76s)]
*  cohost, speaking to like the remora fish kind of dynamic of like neither of them [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3610.44s)]
*  wanted to be good at media. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3617.28s)]
*  They wanted to be NFL coaches. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3618.76s)]
*  I thought there was an idea for him. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3621.2400000000002s)]
*  If he really wanted to have an awesome podcast and committed to it, I think it [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3623.48s)]
*  would have been amazing. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3626.8s)]
*  What's your pitch? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3627.5200000000004s)]
*  No, I just think when he was doing all these different pieces of what he was [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3628.6400000000003s)]
*  doing, but what he really cared about was the NFL films footage, the breakdowns, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3632.24s)]
*  kind of teaching people about football and what was happening in the moment. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3636.3999999999996s)]
*  I think would have been really good, but I don't also don't feel like he wanted to do it. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3640.2s)]
*  He wasn't going to talk about weaknesses. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3644.2s)]
*  He wasn't going to be like, here's the problem with Trevor Lawrence. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3645.64s)]
*  Here's why he struggled for five years. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3649.8399999999997s)]
*  Look at his mechanics. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3651.56s)]
*  Here's how I would attack him. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3652.56s)]
*  If I was playing him, he wasn't doing any of that. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3653.8799999999997s)]
*  So once, once I realized that, like at mid September, I was like, I'm not [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3656.2s)]
*  consuming this anymore, but I think. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3659.64s)]
*  You know, you could argue it worked. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3662.3999999999996s)]
*  Like he got, you got like four or five different paychecks, right? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3663.7999999999997s)]
*  Like his, it seemed like his goal was to make a ton of money for one year and [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3667.12s)]
*  then come back and get an NFL coaching job in February. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3671.16s)]
*  And that did not happen. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3674.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, in fact, the contract with Carolina has this fascinating buyout clause that [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3675.2799999999997s)]
*  just passed. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3679.24s)]
*  So congratulations to Bill Belichick for not exercising his $1 million buyout [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3679.8799999999997s)]
*  clause to get out of Carolina. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3684.52s)]
*  It dropped after June 1st from $10 million to $1 million because he was trying to [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3686.3199999999997s)]
*  engineer an escape patch. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3691.64s)]
*  If the NFL said, you know what? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3692.72s)]
*  We watched a half dozen Bill Belichick media ventures in which, by the way, the [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3694.4s)]
*  COO of Bill Belichick productions is Jordan Hudson. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3699.24s)]
*  Who's that you're reporting? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3703.3199999999997s)]
*  That was out. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3704.96s)]
*  That was on LinkedIn. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3705.7599999999998s)]
*  That was her on her bio being like, I'm the COO of a company that's not [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3707.56s)]
*  incorporated as an LLC anywhere, but was de facto the person you had to negotiate [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3710.92s)]
*  with. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3715.96s)]
*  And in fact, Bill Belichick requested after calling her brilliant to various [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3716.44s)]
*  media partners, hire her for six figures. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3719.96s)]
*  Like this was not just she's the girlfriend and she's very young. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3723.12s)]
*  It's she's running the business and his even more crucially, his public persona, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3726.4s)]
*  which is the key evolution here. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3732.56s)]
*  Private man becomes public figure and how he does it is so illustrative of, again, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3735.2s)]
*  all of these industries, media, business, college, the NFL on and on and on that [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3741.32s)]
*  we've been talking about. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3745.52s)]
*  Can we go big picture on journalism stuff? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3747.12s)]
*  Please. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3748.96s)]
*  Cause these were your bones initially. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3749.44s)]
*  Where'd you go? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3751.0800000000004s)]
*  You did Columbia grad? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3751.5600000000004s)]
*  No, I went to, I went to Harvard and I was a, where'd you go to grad or you didn't [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3752.88s)]
*  just went right in the sports illustrated fact checking department after college. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3757.52s)]
*  My origin story is that, well, I just remember hearing from you when we were [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3761.88s)]
*  doing grandland and you were doing Jeremy Lin stuff. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3765.1200000000003s)]
*  And I was like, who's this guy? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3767.48s)]
*  And then it was like, he's 23. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3768.76s)]
*  It was like, Jesus, it was one of those. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3770.2000000000003s)]
*  It was one of those. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3772.28s)]
*  Frank, I solo still, you know, makes fun of me cause I was the guy like with this [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3773.1600000000003s)]
*  story who emerged kind of out of nowhere for a bunch of people and had these scoops [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3777.64s)]
*  that were beating the certainly for Jeremy Lin, like the New York media [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3782.2s)]
*  ecosystem, but also the national. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3787.96s)]
*  Cause we had Kang at grandland who was doing great stuff and you were doing [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3789.68s)]
*  the great stuff and it was like, the two of you felt like you kind of owned the [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3793.44s)]
*  story for, I don't know. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3796.44s)]
*  How long was that story a month? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3798.12s)]
*  It felt like, it felt like two years. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3799.4s)]
*  It felt like it's still going for me. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3801.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, actually, no, it was, it was two weeks and change in terms of his actual run, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3803.0s)]
*  but in terms of his like actual significance as a figure, yeah, a month, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3806.88s)]
*  a couple of months. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3811.6800000000003s)]
*  But Kang was writing, I think very thoughtful, like some reportage, but like [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3812.8s)]
*  a lot of essayistic stuff. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3817.0s)]
*  And I was the guy who had the Jeremy Lin, yes, because again, I have this weird [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3818.6s)]
*  Rolodex of people. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3823.4s)]

*  Ryan Fitzpatrick was there when I was there. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3827.44s)]
*  Um, one of the first interviews I did in college, I was, uh, covering the heavy [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3829.6800000000003s)]

*  Winklevi. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3848.44s)]
*  So anyway, the point being I went to Harvard, I, uh, wanted to go to law school. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3849.56s)]
*  I did the thing where I had a panic attack taking the LSAT cause I wanted it [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3853.92s)]
*  too much and- [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3857.52s)]

*  who was reasonably having panic attacks during tests. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3867.7200000000003s)]

*  The only time, I don't think that ever happened to me taking a test, probably [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3877.96s)]
*  cause I felt like it probably wasn't going to turn out that well. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3882.6400000000003s)]

*  So you're going to be a lawyer or like- [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3895.96s)]
*  There's an alternate world in which I am a lawyer right now. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3897.4s)]
*  So if you don't have a panic attack during the LSATs. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3899.88s)]
*  I probably go to a law school that I had dreamed of and I never do [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3902.28s)]
*  journalism full time because I did not, I first one of my family born in America, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3907.16s)]

*  gravitational force in my life. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3919.28s)]
*  And because I failed, not failed literally, but like, because I bombed a [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3922.1200000000003s)]
*  test, which is a nightmare for me. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3925.84s)]
*  Uh, I had to figure out what do I do in this gap year? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3928.1600000000003s)]
*  And in that gap year, I said, the thing I've been doing for fun this [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3931.36s)]
*  whole time is writing sports. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3934.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3935.5600000000004s)]
*  And I'd been in internet sports illustrated because I love sports and [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3935.8s)]
*  have always been a sports fan and nerd and fan of writing. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3939.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I'm also somebody who read sports illustrated growing up and like [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3943.6800000000003s)]
*  worship these long form bonus writers, you know, so fact checking [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3947.2000000000003s)]
*  Gary Smith and Scott price and Tim laden and all of these guys, Tom [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3951.64s)]
*  Verducci, like that was my job. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3955.56s)]
*  And I nerded out on it. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3957.7999999999997s)]
*  I had to cross out every word in their stories to make sure it was true. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3958.96s)]
*  What an incredible like dissection of how to do this job at the highest level. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3962.8399999999997s)]
*  And so for me, when did you go to ESPN though? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3969.56s)]
*  2012, the fall of the Jeremy linear, um, espin.com or magazine slash.com, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3972.64s)]
*  but Chad Miller, I was doing five jobs. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3978.64s)]
*  I know I was going to say you were, yeah, I don't have a lot of long-term [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3980.04s)]
*  memory from that era. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3983.04s)]
*  We were living very different distances at ESPN. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3984.08s)]
*  Well, mine was just tired all the time. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3986.48s)]
*  That was one of my exes, two small kids. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3988.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3991.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3991.44s)]
*  But yeah, yeah. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3991.8s)]
*  So I remember, but to be clear, I also grew up reading you. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3992.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3996.16s)]
*  I mean, I didn't say it was good. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3996.96s)]
*  It was really good. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=3998.48s)]
*  Genuinely though, like the idea of, uh, wait a minute. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4001.56s)]
*  I could evolve a medium into something that feels more like me and my [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4005.6s)]
*  sensibility, like the progression of what I went through from like Harvard [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4009.08s)]
*  to sports illustrated to ESPN to getting onto around the horn, RIP and then PTI [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4013.52s)]
*  and then doing like cable political news now and doing other stuff. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4018.44s)]
*  Like I've been waiting to do something that feels more like my own sensibility. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4022.7999999999997s)]
*  And so to get from wherever I started, guy who didn't want to do this [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4027.0s)]
*  professionally to guy who cannot imagine what it would have been like if I had [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4030.7599999999998s)]
*  gotten the score I wanted on the LSAT in which I'm not in this room right now. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4035.16s)]
*  Terrifying sliding doors. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4039.48s)]
*  Possibility. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4042.12s)]
*  But I never got to do this. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4042.96s)]
*  Why couldn't you have done what you want to do with ESPN daily? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4044.12s)]
*  I don't understand that part. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4047.0s)]
*  Cause that was a daily podcast with a lot of resources. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4048.04s)]
*  So did you like make a mistake with how you attacked it or you felt like it [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4050.68s)]
*  was too entrenched with the idea? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4054.44s)]
*  I wanted to do as soon as I realized what, so to credit the New York times daily [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4056.16s)]
*  as like the original sort of format that ESPN daily essentially looked at and [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4062.24s)]
*  said, we want one of those. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4066.16s)]
*  The idea of a two way conversation into which you slide docu style elements, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4067.72s)]
*  interview tape, scoring, editing, structural stuff, you know, from documentaries. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4072.72s)]
*  That was so eye opening to me as a host and producer that I realized I wanted to [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4077.4s)]
*  do this for stuff that I reported instead of stuff that other people did. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4085.4s)]
*  So you just basically have reporters coming on and you're just setting them up [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4089.3199999999997s)]
*  and they're talking about their reporting and you're basically just a [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4094.36s)]
*  cruise director. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4098.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4099.6s)]
*  Cruise director. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4099.84s)]
*  I'm like smart driver. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4100.4400000000005s)]
*  It was like, but by the way, and part of it is, but why couldn't you have [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4101.88s)]
*  changed that though? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4104.360000000001s)]
*  So I really liked doing that because I was truly like getting to do a, in my [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4105.16s)]
*  ambition and even better execution than the written piece was because I would [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4111.4400000000005s)]
*  pick like this story could be something that's three dimensional and has like [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4114.8s)]
*  interview tape and can make this into a docu style. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4119.04s)]
*  I started calling these things and this is very lame, but [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4120.92s)]
*  documentaries, like conversations that also felt like documentaries. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4124.12s)]
*  And that was the sort of medium that I still work in now. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4127.92s)]
*  Um, but I found it to be something that left me too busy to do the passion [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4130.52s)]
*  projects where I was like, man, this format is so perfect for me. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4136.68s)]
*  If I can evolve it and report these myself and being a cruise director in [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4140.24s)]
*  which I have to bring energy and smiling and selling stuff that sometimes I didn't [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4143.68s)]
*  want to do as much as the other stuff. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4148.04s)]
*  That became something that I would have done frankly, if I think to be very [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4150.4400000000005s)]
*  blunt ESPN cared more about it. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4155.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4157.52s)]
*  And it was just sort of like, but in, in their way they care about it because they [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4158.04s)]
*  gave it resources, but that doesn't mean they cared about it in the correct way. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4161.96s)]
*  I would say I believe that they liked the idea of it. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4166.12s)]
*  They were like, no, this is it. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4168.96s)]
*  And you have resources for it. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4170.04s)]
*  Do this. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4171.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4172.360000000001s)]
*  And by the way, it no longer exists. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4172.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4174.56s)]
*  So Nina did it, then I did it. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4174.8s)]
*  And then there was a rotation of people who did their best with the staff that [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4176.2s)]
*  was overworked. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4179.72s)]
*  And in the end it's not around anymore because I don't think they ever fully [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4180.4400000000005s)]
*  understood the potential. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4184.16s)]
*  And so for me, saying is pain, didn't understand the potential of a podcast. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4185.6s)]
*  That way our lives are quite similar. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4190.52s)]
*  Try anyway, in that way, you and I, not so different. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4192.240000000001s)]
*  No, it's crazy. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4195.92s)]
*  It's crazy to see what has left ESPN in the world of podcasting from a [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4196.96s)]
*  tear cynical self interest perspective. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4201.64s)]
*  The podcast you have now, did you spit ball with ride home and all? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4203.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4206.96s)]
*  Oh, Eric and I, I mean, look. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4207.68s)]
*  Cause what you're doing, I don't know if he told you this, but he wanted me to do [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4208.84s)]
*  this show in 2009 called Bill Simmons investigates and I still have the email. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4212.4400000000005s)]
*  He sent me this long email. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4217.360000000001s)]
*  He was basically like, we're taking your mail bag and just investigate the dumbest [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4219.08s)]
*  things. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4223.280000000001s)]
*  And I think this could be a TV show. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4223.64s)]
*  And at that point I kind of, I kind of knew where I want to do grandly and I [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4225.84s)]
*  want to do fine. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4229.64s)]
*  I didn't want to do a TV show, but I always thought it was an interesting idea [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4230.4400000000005s)]
*  and it was a great email. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4233.360000000001s)]
*  And I didn't know if that was what led to part of what you're trying to do. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4234.32s)]
*  Not that, not the idea, but a piece of it. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4239.08s)]
*  Eric mentioned this to me, like maybe a year into the show. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4241.44s)]
*  Cause it was a great idea, dude, the whole idea of using journalism to solve [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4246.8s)]
*  stupid and or serious and our smart, funny mysteries is it's funny. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4251.32s)]
*  Like I talk to people like I'm using journalism, solve mysteries. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4256.719999999999s)]
*  And some journalists will look at me and be like, you mean do journalism? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4259.16s)]
*  And I'm like, Oh yeah, I'm kind of just rebranding what journalism is. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4262.4s)]
*  Uh, but that's kind of the point. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4265.12s)]
*  It's a great, I mean, look, my brother helped me come up with my older brother [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4267.04s)]
*  who is not sports fluent really at all. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4271.32s)]
*  Um, except Tottenham sports, he loved Tottenham football. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4273.64s)]
*  Um, he, uh, he helped me come up with the name Pablo Torre finds out. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4276.36s)]
*  And I think that only once the name crystallized, did it become clear that [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4280.76s)]
*  this was a through line through my curiosity. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4286.28s)]
*  And so the whole idea of yes, I'm going to investigate something, solve a mystery [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4289.2s)]
*  that man, I think the name ended up crystallizing the ambition in a way that [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4295.68s)]
*  I only realize in retrospect. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4301.12s)]
*  Um, but I would have loved to have subscribed to Bill Simmons [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4302.68s)]
*  investigates in which I don't know. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4306.04s)]
*  I don't know how I could have done it. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4308.16s)]
*  You would have done, but [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4309.2s)]
*  I don't know how I could have done it for ESPN. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4310.2s)]
*  I don't know how I could have written my column. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4313.04s)]
*  It would have been, I mean, I can tell you that like this thing is my second [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4315.12s)]
*  child, this show. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4317.48s)]
*  And I take it seriously. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4318.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4321.36s)]
*  So we have to honestly that that's the way I have to do anything. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4321.5599999999995s)]
*  It's probably unhealthy, honestly. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4324.4s)]
*  Um, but like the Belichick story to me is such a thin slice of my brain, but [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4326.12s)]
*  the thing that everybody wants to talk about. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4332.24s)]
*  And meanwhile, I have like these other things that I'm like working on right [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4334.24s)]
*  now that I find to be in many ways so much weirder and more important. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4337.36s)]
*  And, but by the way, I, I reached out to you when we did the LeBron tape, the [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4342.92s)]
*  Nick's video to recruit LeBron, the Sopranos secret video. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4349.96s)]
*  Oh, I already knew that story though. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4354.92s)]
*  But I, I got the tape bill. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4356.56s)]
*  You can actually watch the video. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4359.56s)]
*  You can see James Gandolfini and Edie Falco in this weird apartment acting [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4361.76s)]
*  like a super sweet 16 video for LeBron James at the behest of James Dolan, in [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4367.52s)]
*  which the next face you see after they play this scene in which, by the way, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4371.92s)]
*  yes, turns out the Sopranos sub Reddit was very excited about this. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4375.96s)]
*  They're alive. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4379.4400000000005s)]
*  Like they're in the cinematic universe, somehow looking for an apartment. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4381.24s)]
*  Sopranos sub Reddit is still going. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4384.08s)]
*  I mean, as a metaphor, maybe for the topic at hand. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4387.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4389.64s)]
*  I didn't even know it existed. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4389.84s)]
*  I've been to black and still ain't going. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4390.8s)]
*  It sounds great. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4392.72s)]
*  So the point being though, that like that video in which, by the way, the [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4393.68s)]
*  first face you see in this episode and we got the whole video is Donald Trump. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4397.36s)]
*  James Dolan assembles a murderers row of people. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4403.5599999999995s)]
*  And in that list, Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Harvey Weinstein, like we see all of it. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4407.08s)]
*  And then we also got the Harvey Weinstein. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4413.96s)]
*  I mean, yeah, we also got my favorite part is that they also, and no one had known [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4416.4s)]
*  this before. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4422.32s)]
*  They did versions of this for Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4423.28s)]
*  And so we have the alts where it's like the same script, but they swap out the [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4427.759999999999s)]
*  names and it's just like the comedy of again, behind the scenes. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4431.84s)]
*  How does the team that has everything, Lore LeBron James. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4435.32s)]
*  And the reason I reached out to you was that you've long been on this thing with [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4439.32s)]
*  the Knicks and LeBron where the Knicks messed it up. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4443.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, part of it was, I think they, Donnie Walsh was running it. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4446.84s)]
*  He was in a wheelchair. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4450.44s)]
*  And he was in a wheelchair and they wheeled them in and it just was, wasn't great. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4450.92s)]
*  Well, I think they were like, wait, this guy's running the team. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4455.68s)]
*  He seems old and weak. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4458.28s)]
*  But the missing piece is that in roles, Donnie Walsh and this contingent. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4459.84s)]
*  And again, LeBron has everybody visiting him in this hotel and this, sorry, this [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4464.32s)]
*  building and into the boardroom. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4468.4400000000005s)]
*  It's these delegations. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4471.88s)]
*  The SUVs roll up and it's the Clippers and it's all these teams. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4473.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4477.04s)]
*  Sterling. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4478.4s)]
*  Didn't really win the room over. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4479.24s)]
*  It was tough for him. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4481.04s)]
*  Did not. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4481.84s)]
*  But into the room, I walked in New York Knicks and the lights darken and they [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4482.8s)]
*  press play and this video starts. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4487.04s)]
*  And so the missing piece was like, what's it actually like to have seen this? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4490.36s)]
*  What I can tell you is that after I published the episode, people in the [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4493.88s)]
*  bronze camp were like, thank God people finally understand what that was like. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4497.12s)]
*  They didn't have the tape either. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4502.04s)]
*  But again, because I'm a kind of unhinged dog with a bone on these like [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4503.88s)]
*  sports culture mysteries, I take it as a point of pride that I got to finally [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4509.0s)]
*  close the loop on one of these ongoing. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4514.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4517.64s)]
*  Like urban legend, but actually real stories. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4517.84s)]
*  So like the lottery stuff. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4520.92s)]
*  It's a frozen envelope. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4524.08s)]
*  Have you done that one yet? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4525.16s)]
*  So I, I've been, I've been doing reporting around this. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4526.24s)]
*  I'll spoil a little bit of it. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4530.68s)]
*  I just know that there was one MBA owner I talked to recently who was [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4532.24s)]
*  absolutely convinced this is. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4535.679999999999s)]
*  Rick. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4537.44s)]
*  It was the easiest one to rig because it was seven envelopes. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4538.16s)]
*  You, I, I studied it. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4541.96s)]
*  I remember doing a mailbag thing about it at some point. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4543.28s)]
*  I studied it. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4545.2s)]
*  There was one that seemed a little bit, but at that footage was really grainy [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4546.28s)]
*  and the, the way apparently he could have done it if you were going to do it. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4550.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't even know if that you can do it. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4553.88s)]
*  And by the way, it would be massive fraud and a whole bunch of terrible [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4555.16s)]
*  things that come out of it. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4558.2s)]
*  But if you froze one of the envelopes and made them extremely cold and your [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4559.48s)]
*  finger, like you can see his hands going in there and if you just felt the one [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4564.28s)]
*  and you would know that's the one, that's how you would do it. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4569.84s)]
*  I think with now at the ping pong balls, I don't know how you would do it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4572.24s)]
*  Well, I think there's still, well, on the frozen envelope theory, I talked to David [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4574.6s)]
*  Falk was as you know, Jordan's agent, Ewing's agent also, and I asked him about [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4578.44s)]
*  MBA conspiracies, specifically that and the gambling, you know, alleged suspension [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4582.76s)]
*  retirement, Michael Jordan, you know, which you've talked about also endlessly. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4587.8s)]
*  It's very surreal by the way, to get these conspiracies directly from you at [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4590.92s)]
*  this table, having heard you. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4594.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, those are, I mean, those are the two most famous ones. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4596.04s)]
*  But so I asked David Falk about them. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4598.52s)]
*  He's he's the agent for both men, a unique perspective. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4599.96s)]
*  And he says the Jordan one that's bullshit. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4602.84s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense, but the Ewing one, he says I could kind of see it. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4605.96s)]
*  And I'm like, okay. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4610.52s)]
*  And so we have this conversation and the whole thing about conspiracies in the [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4612.04s)]
*  NBA and in life. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4615.8s)]
*  You've triggered conspiracy bill, by the way, is full right now. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4617.64s)]
*  I felt the temperature. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4620.92s)]
*  Yeah, hair standing on my arms. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4622.68s)]
*  The barometric pressure in the studio has shifted. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4624.52s)]
*  They didn't realize he was going to show up today. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4627.0s)]
*  It's an honor to meet you. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4629.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, conspiracy. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4630.280000000001s)]
*  He's right here. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4631.240000000001s)]
*  The thing about NBA conspiracies and conspiracies and politics in life is that [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4633.0s)]
*  the difference between truth and plausibility is an interesting distinction. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4637.320000000001s)]
*  Because if you have either truth or plausibility, people care. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4642.2s)]
*  And so now we've come all the way back around to the difference between [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4647.8s)]
*  gossip and journalism, between click bait and something that's popular, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4651.0s)]
*  between algorithms and curiosity. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4655.24s)]
*  Like, yes, these are hard things that have eaten the brains of everybody in America [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4657.88s)]
*  because there are incentives to be dishonest in the service of some larger conspiracy. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4663.88s)]
*  But sometimes, sometimes there is truth and that's what journalism is trying to get to. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4669.48s)]
*  Sometimes you learn things as the years go on and you get a tidbit and you go. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4676.44s)]
*  And then it makes you revisit. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4682.36s)]
*  Like for me, I forget when Shaq did this. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4684.2s)]
*  Shaq told the story might have been on a podcast about how David Stern asked him [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4687.879999999999s)]
*  if she wanted to be warm weather or cold weather before the lottery. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4692.2s)]
*  And he said warm and then Orlando. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4696.12s)]
*  And he's like. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4698.12s)]
*  That's something that happened. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4700.599999999999s)]
*  So then you hear that and you're like, wait a second. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4701.96s)]
*  And now you have to go backwards and revisit, you know, especially 84, 85, the lottery. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4703.96s)]
*  I think that it's by far. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4712.04s)]
*  If you look at all the teams, by far, you into the next was the best case scenario for them. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4714.68s)]
*  The Jordan one. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4719.64s)]
*  Here's the part that's never added up. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4721.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4723.72s)]
*  And if I had to put a ratio on it, I would go 80 20. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4723.96s)]
*  I think he actually like there was no chicannery. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4728.2s)]
*  He just he was upset about his dad and retired. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4730.68s)]
*  Every story about this dude, which we revisit now because we have to argue about the goat [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4734.44s)]
*  contractually, all of us like once a month. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4739.16s)]
*  Every story is about what a homicidal competitor he was. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4742.6s)]
*  Most competitive guy ever competing on everything. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4745.56s)]
*  Be in the airport waiting for bags and he would pay off the baggage hand there [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4749.0s)]
*  because he had to win that badly. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4753.48s)]
*  And we're all supposed to accept that. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4756.04s)]
*  He just shut that off and left basketball after he went through straight titles. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4758.679999999999s)]
*  Because he had nothing left to prove. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4764.44s)]
*  So were you homicidally competitive or are you the kind of guy who can just shut it off [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4766.759999999999s)]
*  because you have nothing else to prove that I've never reconciled those two things. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4770.839999999999s)]
*  I think that is one of the things that's most fascinating. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4775.0s)]
*  Big picture about sports to me. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4777.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4778.839999999999s)]
*  Here you have the greatest winners, right? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4779.08s)]
*  So we start with Balachek, we get to Jordan. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4781.08s)]
*  The greatest winners who have assembled everything that everyone else lusts after. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4782.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4788.36s)]
*  And still there are these gaping holes in what makes them feel fulfilled. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4788.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4793.32s)]
*  And that to me is why sports is both the perfect metaphor for everything else. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4793.88s)]
*  It's also just on its own fascinating. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4799.24s)]
*  And the Jordan stuff, I mean, look, I think that when it comes to, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4801.72s)]
*  I mean, I'm the type of guy who found, this is the other story that I did where people were like, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4809.88s)]
*  this is beneath you. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4815.88s)]
*  And I'm like, I got bad news for you. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4816.679999999999s)]
*  This is eye level for me. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4818.679999999999s)]
*  For months, right? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4822.84s)]
*  I'm seeing these stories about Marcus Jordan dating Larsa Pippen. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4824.44s)]
*  And I'm like, on one level, unbelievably superficial, empty, vacuous tabloid trash [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4829.96s)]
*  for someone who's an NBA fan, who grew up watching the Bulls. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4836.759999999999s)]
*  The idea that Scottie Pippen's ex-wife is dating Michael Jordan's son and everybody around them [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4842.12s)]
*  is like having to deal with this. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4848.36s)]
*  And on top of it, Pippen and Jordan had the fallout after the last dance. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4850.679999999999s)]
*  Like there's some layers. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4854.28s)]
*  And so the timeline was not merely, wow, interesting through the lens of history, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4856.2s)]
*  actively contentious now informing our understanding of how Michael Jordan operates, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4860.12s)]
*  how Scottie Pippen operates, who cares about what, the power dynamics on a team being [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4865.0s)]
*  relitigated decades later in public through their loved ones and former loved ones. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4869.72s)]
*  So what I did was, and this is again, my insanity, is that I listened to every episode of the podcast [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4875.72s)]
*  that Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan were hosting together, which very few people remember. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4881.96s)]
*  How many episodes was that? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4886.36s)]
*  They did about a dozen. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4887.56s)]
*  It was called Separation Anxiety and it was horrible. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4888.52s)]
*  You listened to all 12 episodes of that? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4891.24s)]
*  I'm a journalist. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4893.72s)]
*  Oh my, were you doing other stuff? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4895.16s)]
*  Were you playing like video games? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4897.08s)]
*  I mean, you just concentrate on that. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4898.44s)]
*  That sounds horrible. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4900.92s)]
*  Just know that parenting a child while having that in the background is probably something [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4901.72s)]
*  I'll get sued for by my daughter. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4906.04s)]
*  Yeah, fair. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4907.64s)]
*  But what happened was we did all of that. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4908.92s)]
*  And then the coup de grace was I invited Marcus and Larsa together onto my show and [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4910.76s)]
*  interviewed them and got to talk and confront them about this story. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4916.68s)]
*  And it resulted in a number of New York Post headlines in which they called me miserable [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4922.36s)]
*  and that I was unfair to them and all that stuff, which is okay because they shouldn't [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4925.48s)]
*  necessarily like what I have to say to them. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4928.679999999999s)]
*  But the question of is it true and interesting and significant for a certain quadrant of [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4931.32s)]
*  people that actually is in my audience? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4935.88s)]
*  I think that's kind of that. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4939.08s)]
*  That's what I enjoy is like, yes, it is kind of envelope pushing to take this seriously. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4941.5599999999995s)]
*  But if I can prove to you that it's worth your time, then I think everybody got what [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4947.24s)]
*  they wanted here. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4950.5199999999995s)]
*  So you're basically taking somebody's on a text thread with four of their buddies who [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4951.48s)]
*  love sports and there's this large subpoena of things happening like what the fuck is [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4956.2s)]
*  going on with this? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4960.28s)]
*  That's an episode for you. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4962.12s)]
*  For me, group chats and texts from people who are like, I don't know if I can say this [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4963.48s)]
*  or I heard this is a huge source of just incoming ideas. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4968.919999999999s)]
*  And the question is always, can I do this responsibly and accurately and rigorously [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4975.799999999999s)]
*  such that I can still plausibly be considered a journalist by the Murrow and Peabody people [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4979.8s)]
*  while also satisfying my friends who I use as like these proxies for my audience? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4985.24s)]
*  Like I like to take stories seriously, but not myself so seriously. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4991.64s)]
*  And that's why I'm here is to say like, yeah, please do laugh at me. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=4998.28s)]
*  Like I am not here to be insulated from criticism. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5002.68s)]
*  Just know that I am so bizarrely prepared to discuss it. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5006.84s)]
*  If you have questions that all I ask is the ability to explain maybe what people did not [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5010.92s)]
*  hear or listen to because it got clipped out because that's the game too. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5015.64s)]
*  And I am not fighting it. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5019.56s)]
*  I just want people to look at the stuff in totality. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5020.68s)]
*  So if somebody wanted you to do an episode about how corn has didn't leave his house [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5025.0s)]
*  for four years other than to play golf once a week, do you bat that around with somebody [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5030.2s)]
*  else or is it just like an instinct? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5036.44s)]
*  Like I can't do that. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5038.2s)]
*  That's not going to work as an episode. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5039.08s)]
*  The first question I ask myself is does voice modulated Bill Simmons still discernibly [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5040.919999999999s)]
*  sound like Bill Simmons? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5045.799999999999s)]
*  Bill Simmons, AI and French. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5048.12s)]
*  Can we get you a spot shadow? [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5050.759999999999s)]
*  It's different languages. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5053.24s)]
*  We had to be great for a lot of us. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5055.24s)]
*  I can't wait. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5057.0s)]
*  We turned down. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5058.12s)]
*  I mean, not that this is a noble position, but we turned down. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5058.839999999999s)]
*  There was an offer from a tech company that will remain nameless to like, hey, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5061.5599999999995s)]
*  you have an archive of shows with people talking in this conversational way. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5064.52s)]
*  Can we pay you to train our AI bots? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5068.52s)]
*  We were like, no. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5072.68s)]
*  No, you can't. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5074.360000000001s)]
*  And by the way, parallel to that is this media tour thing. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5076.120000000001s)]
*  Like Harvey Levin and TMZ asked me to talk to him about Belchek and I said, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5079.320000000001s)]
*  I don't think I can do that. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5084.76s)]
*  I think my standard for the lowest brow programming I can do is the Bill Simmons show. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5086.200000000001s)]
*  And so that's why. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5092.280000000001s)]
*  That was a dig. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5092.92s)]
*  We're getting along so well. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5094.52s)]
*  What the hell? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5095.8s)]
*  This is a higher end of show. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5097.240000000001s)]
*  You founded Grantland. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5098.92s)]
*  Wasn't that fun? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5100.360000000001s)]
*  That's the spirit of what I do is honestly like we have so many friends in common [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5101.88s)]
*  because your coaching tree to now do the compliment thing, right? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5106.68s)]
*  Your coaching tree on Belichick. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5112.040000000001s)]
*  It's a tree. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5114.6s)]
*  I don't know what kind of what kind of tree. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5115.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5117.080000000001s)]
*  It's a lot of great people have passed through my life. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5117.64s)]
*  And I have become friends with them in part sometimes because [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5120.68s)]
*  I first encountered them through things that you had made. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5124.28s)]
*  And we then went on to become friends who then text me. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5127.639999999999s)]
*  What the fuck's happening with you and Bill? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5130.92s)]
*  And which I say, I don't know. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5133.72s)]
*  I'm not sure he knows what my show is, but I'm happy to explain it. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5135.24s)]
*  But then also it is the recognition that [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5138.679999999999s)]
*  who you choose to surround yourself with is kind of the through line in all of it. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5142.28s)]
*  In the reporting I did with Belichick in why I'm here with you. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5146.44s)]
*  And to the degree that, you know, the media is a bizarre chaotic industry [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5150.76s)]
*  that I now I'm trying to navigate as an independent [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5155.96s)]
*  training wheels entrepreneur with a show. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5158.68s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5161.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I could use good ideas. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5161.96s)]
*  I could use help. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5164.76s)]
*  I could use people just saying, hey, they do stuff that is like this that you might enjoy. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5165.56s)]
*  So you getting pitched ideas and concepts and you're like, it doesn't pass. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5170.28s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5175.8s)]
*  Like what's the what's like the incubation process? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5176.36s)]
*  I am. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5179.88s)]
*  My staff makes fun of me. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5181.08s)]
*  Like we have a staff. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5182.28s)]
*  You do realize you have two producers over there who are like, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5185.72s)]
*  like what's the staff? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5189.08s)]
*  I mean, we have them in the credits of every Friday episode in which we shout them out. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5190.6s)]
*  But I tried to make it like researchers, like all kinds of people. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5193.88s)]
*  We have a couple of people who are devoted. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5196.84s)]
*  Everyone does more than one thing, but yes, I wanted to make a mini news [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5199.08s)]
*  because what I can't do is we do three episodes a week. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5202.92s)]
*  Called Pablo Torres deep pockets. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5205.8s)]
*  I mean, Dan Lebatards deep pockets, man. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5207.72s)]
*  I'm using his money to fund a weird project that no one really asked for. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5210.04s)]
*  But is the thing that I'm like trying to make sustainable. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5214.360000000001s)]
*  I am somebody who wanted to hire people to simulate what feels like a modern newsroom, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5218.12s)]
*  tongue in cheek, but not in which, yeah, I get tips. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5224.92s)]
*  But more than that, I'm like perpetually pressure testing these ideas that I have. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5227.96s)]
*  So my phone, my Slack channel is just an endless stream of me pitching my staff ideas. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5233.0s)]
*  Like, I think we should do this, but we got to make these calls. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5238.52s)]
*  Can we do that? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5241.96s)]
*  I found this weird nugget buried in this other thing. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5242.6s)]
*  There was this bankruptcy filing. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5244.68s)]
*  This is a bread crumb for a future episode. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5246.44s)]
*  There's this bankruptcy filing that I think everybody would find fascinating [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5247.8s)]
*  if I can get to the bottom of it. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5252.12s)]
*  My skill, if I have one, is hopefully trying to discern whether someone who's not me [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5255.16s)]
*  would find something that I find interesting. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5261.48s)]
*  Chang's golf career? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5265.08s)]
*  You know, I wanted to do when you got, were you with him at Augusta? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5266.679999999999s)]
*  Chang was supposed to be, I was. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5268.679999999999s)]
*  His dad wanted him to be a PGA golfer. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5271.719999999999s)]
*  I was walking around with like torn rotator cuffs, getting like Tommy Johns. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5273.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, he filmed 35 straight weeks of Netflix episodes and his body like literally broke down. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5277.719999999999s)]
*  I wanted to do the episode. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5283.0s)]
*  And I've talked to him before about this and I'll just spoil it because you have first dibs. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5284.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like the secret world of food at Augusta beyond like the stand in front, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5289.08s)]
*  but like the secret, you know what I'm talking about. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5293.96s)]
*  They don't, they just don't do, I mean, I guess you could. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5296.84s)]
*  They're not, you're not going to find anything out from Augusta. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5301.32s)]
*  This is why, this is why I do what I do. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5304.84s)]
*  Oh, so you think you could? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5307.56s)]
*  I think I'm going to wear a trench coat and David Chang's going to be the top part. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5308.68s)]
*  And I'm going to have a mech suit underneath. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5311.96s)]
*  Wear like Mission Impossible, like a David Chang mask. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5314.04s)]
*  One ticket, please. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5316.12s)]
*  We walk into Augusta together. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5317.72s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5319.56s)]
*  Yes, by the way, I love doing stuff and this can sound very retrograde and edgier than I think. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5320.76s)]
*  I love doing stuff that people don't want me to do. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5327.32s)]
*  Like if I find something interesting and the people in charge of it are like, no. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5330.6s)]
*  Now I'm like, well, what do you got to hide? [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5336.2s)]
*  Why don't you want people to know that there's a secret special [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5338.04s)]
*  like food court for rich people, the Illuminati in the back of Augusta. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5341.0s)]
*  You know what would have been a good episode that you can't do now? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5345.32s)]
*  I was obsessed with this for like two years when Stern was commissioner. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5349.56s)]
*  Apparently at every NBA party, I think I've talked about this. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5353.48s)]
*  He loved Pigs in a Blanket. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5358.28s)]
*  And they had to be at every NBA function and party. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5361.0s)]
*  And there was this one party where they didn't have NBA Pigs in a Blanket. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5363.72s)]
*  And he freaked out and was really upset about it. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5367.24s)]
*  And I was like, this sounds amazing. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5370.28s)]
*  I don't know if that's quite an episode, but David Stern's obsession with Pigs in a Blanket [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5371.88s)]
*  feels like the formation of something. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5376.12s)]
*  I hesitate to inform you that I would have greenlit that. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5379.0s)]
*  I don't know if there's a note. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5383.48s)]
*  It feels like there needs to be a second piece to it. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5384.28s)]
*  And what kind of Pigs in a Blanket? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5386.44s)]
*  We're talking about the microwavable kind. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5387.96s)]
*  Is David Stern want like super bespoke? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5389.16s)]
*  So somebody told me that. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5391.32s)]
*  And then like, I don't know, nine months later, I was at one of those functions [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5392.6s)]
*  and they had Pigs in a Blanket and I was watching them eat it. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5396.12s)]
*  And that was the most horrific I've ever been in my life. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5398.68s)]
*  I was like, he's eating the Pigs in the Blanket. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5401.88s)]
*  It's true. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5404.52s)]
*  There's a metaphor there for Scott Foster somehow. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5405.32s)]
*  I was like, yeah, you got to... [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5408.280000000001s)]
*  Tip of that. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5409.080000000001s)]
*  By the way, I'm sure you've had this experience, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5410.68s)]
*  but like when you do stuff that the NBA doesn't love sometimes... [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5413.72s)]
*  Oh, I haven't had that experience ever. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5417.0s)]
*  Never. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5418.92s)]
*  The number of calls you get, like just even uttering Scott Foster in this microphone. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5419.56s)]
*  Like Tim Frank, if you're listening, I'm sorry that I did this, but like, yeah, man, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5423.96s)]
*  I would love to make a Pigs in a Blanket metaphor for NBA officiating and the dial they turn to get [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5427.64s)]
*  an outcome, not explicitly to conspiratorially rig a game, but just like more scoring, less scoring, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5434.12s)]
*  more fouls, fewer fouls, just like big picture stuff. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5441.96s)]
*  This has been out there for a bunch of years now and I think people are at least a little [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5445.48s)]
*  bit aware of it. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5449.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a reason they released the ref assignments the day of the game. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5451.32s)]
*  There was also ref stats that I think some gamblers took advantage of in the 2000s, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5455.0s)]
*  but just in general, teams can complain. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5459.16s)]
*  This is the big thing people need to understand about officials. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5462.36s)]
*  Teams can complain about how a game was called. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5464.92s)]
*  They'll send the things and then the league will tell the officials for the next game, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5467.0s)]
*  like they're getting away with too much stuff. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5470.44s)]
*  They can't do that or they'll give them some sort of directive that will then shape the next game. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5472.599999999999s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons the games will feel a little differently. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5477.0s)]
*  Like if Neesmith and we're taping this for game one of the finals, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5479.5599999999995s)]
*  if Neesmith is just hounding SGA and he's just bumping them and touching them and it's like [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5482.92s)]
*  crossing the line, but they let it go, the league will then tell the rest for the next game. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5488.44s)]
*  Like here's footage of Neesmith. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5493.0s)]
*  You can't let them do this. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5495.4s)]
*  That's the good version of this. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5497.4s)]
*  There might be some more sinister versions of it too. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5498.759999999999s)]
*  So I think it's true. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5501.48s)]
*  Back in the past, maybe not now. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5502.36s)]
*  Well, I think it's inevitable that the NBA, because you officiate games at the end differently [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5503.799999999999s)]
*  than you do at the beginning, is inviting an arbitrary, I know it when I see it standard, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5509.96s)]
*  which is up for interpretation, judicial interpretation that varies [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5516.6s)]
*  depending on what the instructions are that game. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5520.52s)]
*  The thing though about, and I love this. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5523.320000000001s)]
*  This is a thing I have looked into and that I want to do something with. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5525.400000000001s)]
*  But again, I'm happy to just talk about it a bit. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5527.8s)]
*  The complaints that teams make to the league. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5531.240000000001s)]
*  Pointed with video. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5534.04s)]
*  What I've been told is that the teams that complain the most often, I'll name two of them. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5536.52s)]
*  I'm curious if you're surprised. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5542.04s)]
*  One is the New York Knicks. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5543.96s)]
*  Huh. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5546.04s)]
*  The other is the Oklahoma City Thunder. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5546.76s)]
*  Just like which teams file the most complaints because of stuff that causes them to think [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5550.12s)]
*  we got chopped. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5557.32s)]
*  And it's, I'm told reliably those two teams are among the most offended [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5559.08s)]
*  and yeah, liable to file paperwork. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5566.28s)]
*  Conspiracy Bill was on alert for game six of Knicks Pacers. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5569.32s)]
*  And it was interesting. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5573.08s)]
*  They let basically Brunson and Halbert get manhandled the whole game. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5574.04s)]
*  So they basically just, because Halbert was dripping the ball up and they're, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5577.4s)]
*  Bridges and Ananoby were like clubbing him as he's just dribbling a straight line. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5581.24s)]
*  I was like, Jesus. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5586.5199999999995s)]
*  But they were just as physical with Brunson. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5587.4s)]
*  I think it's better. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5589.32s)]
*  I think social media has really evened it out. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5590.04s)]
*  Because the darkest moment other than Donahue and other than the Artest Melee [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5592.2s)]
*  of the 21st century for the NBA, I think was that 06 finals [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5597.48s)]
*  and how appalled everybody was. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5601.96s)]
*  By how I was officiated. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5604.04s)]
*  Sure. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5605.8s)]
*  And I think Wade shot 25 free throws in game five, but it's just, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5606.36s)]
*  it didn't sit right. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5611.08s)]
*  Cuban staring down Stern after a loss, which has never happened before since [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5612.12s)]
*  in the history of the league. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5616.5199999999995s)]
*  Him just from the court staring at him, stink eye. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5617.8s)]
*  Do you miss David Stern? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5621.48s)]
*  I do. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5625.8s)]
*  I think he was starting to really lose it at the end and it was time for him to [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5628.04s)]
*  retire. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5631.48s)]
*  And obviously people come and go. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5631.88s)]
*  From the planet. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5634.28s)]
*  Or for jobs and from the planet. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5635.72s)]
*  There was something about how he shepherded stuff that I thought was, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5641.56s)]
*  maybe it belonged to its own era. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5646.5199999999995s)]
*  He just didn't put up with shit. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5648.68s)]
*  You know, what a, I think Adam Silver has succeeded in ways that are indisputable financially. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5650.68s)]
*  Now with this last CBA. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5659.24s)]
*  Although maybe that's not his fault. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5661.16s)]
*  Um, what's wait, what's your take on tripling the CBA? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5663.16s)]
*  No, it's not the, not the money they made. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5667.4s)]
*  It's, it's what it did competitively to the league with all the aprons. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5669.16s)]
*  I think it's really going to badly fuck up the league. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5672.5199999999995s)]
*  So to that point, by the way, as we're looking at the second apron, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5674.919999999999s)]
*  basically doing something that the NBA has always needed more of, which is reduce. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5677.5599999999995s)]
*  The, uh, platform in the most expensive, uh, settings for superstars to be even more important. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5683.32s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5690.36s)]
*  Like that's the thing about the second apron and Adam's tenure, I think, is that [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5690.68s)]
*  it's just very funny that he learned at the knee of David Stern and operates behind the [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5696.52s)]
*  scenes so differently. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5701.08s)]
*  And I think David Stern, what would WW DSD, what would David Stern do is a question I [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5703.64s)]
*  ask myself very often when it comes to, it's funny when people get to that point. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5710.6s)]
*  Cause I actually think Belichick was at that point, how people put together their roster [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5714.200000000001s)]
*  was almost like, would you sign this guy for 85 million? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5719.32s)]
*  Well, would Belichick do that? [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5721.719999999999s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5722.92s)]
*  And he had hit that point at least through the mid 2010s and then it kind of faded away. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5724.12s)]
*  But I think Stern was, for the most part, I had really good instincts. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5728.04s)]
*  I thought near the end, I thought he'd lost. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5732.44s)]
*  I will never understand the OKC Seattle thing. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5734.36s)]
*  That's oh, oh, oh, sure. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5737.48s)]
*  When he was running the team or when he relocated the team. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5738.599999999999s)]
*  No, when he let the OKC guys by Seattle to steal them and steal them away. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5741.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll never understand why the conflict of interest with the New Orleans owning that [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5746.28s)]
*  franchise remains just an amazing thing that I still marvel at, man. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5749.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5754.679999999999s)]
*  Wait, we don't have a lot of time off because you got to fly to LA. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5756.12s)]
*  I have more topics for you though. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5760.679999999999s)]
*  We had Todd Kornheiser. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5762.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5764.36s)]
*  Cause I've never really talked about him on a podcast with somebody who's actually worked [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5764.92s)]
*  with them and spent real time with them because I think it's hard. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5769.96s)]
*  He's a hard person to explain. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5772.679999999999s)]
*  It was interesting to think about him in the context of Around the Horn ending, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5774.2s)]
*  whether that show would go to an hour. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5777.4800000000005s)]
*  And I heard those rumors and I was like, there is no way in a million years, [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5779.0s)]
*  Tony will go to an hour unless they pay him some ungodly sum. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5784.76s)]
*  And even then I don't even think he'd want to do it. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5788.44s)]
*  Dollars per minute is the stat that Tony Kornheiser values. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5791.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5794.84s)]
*  It's like, I'll do it, but here's the prep. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5795.08s)]
*  But anyway, I first did TV with him in 09 and I'm sure you remember losing [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5797.32s)]
*  your PTI virginity as well when the date, when the day I was September 09. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5803.8s)]
*  When were you? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5807.24s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5808.2s)]
*  I think I filled in, um, this must've been five or six. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5809.0s)]
*  Phil, I'm old now, man. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5813.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't remember the exact year. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5814.92s)]
*  So mid 2010 somewhere. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5816.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5817.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5818.2s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5818.6s)]
*  It would have been 2013, 14, probably 2014. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5819.08s)]
*  So I did four days. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5822.6s)]
*  I flew to DC. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5825.08s)]
*  I'm still writing my column and I was completely terrified. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5826.360000000001s)]
*  And Kornheiser basically walked me through like a young puppy on a leash on the sidewalks [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5830.12s)]
*  and helped me kind of bait and just sold everything I did. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5836.84s)]
*  And by the end of it, I was like, all right, I think I actually understand the mechanics [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5840.28s)]
*  of this now. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5843.56s)]
*  Now it's going to take years to figure out how to do it, but I get it. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5844.76s)]
*  It was like one of the best educations I ever had in four days. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5849.16s)]
*  He's my goat. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5853.16s)]
*  Tony Kornheiser is to me the greatest of all time. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5854.12s)]
*  And I say that not because whatever. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5856.36s)]
*  He would appreciate that. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5859.4s)]
*  I say that because when it comes to a teammate on TV who presents as very hard to win over, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5860.759999999999s)]
*  once he agrees that he can trust you, he is the best salesman of the person across the [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5869.5599999999995s)]
*  desk from him in the history of television. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5875.48s)]
*  And he's smart and he's funny and he's quick. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5878.12s)]
*  And for all of the things we've been saying, the through line of this episode is also [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5880.04s)]
*  what happens when you get older. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5885.639999999999s)]
*  His fastball is still humming, man. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5886.92s)]
*  I know. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5889.16s)]
*  It's I don't like when he says like, I'm done. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5889.64s)]
*  Nobody wants to see me on TV. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5891.8s)]
*  They want to throw me over the side. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5893.400000000001s)]
*  They want to get rid of me. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5895.0s)]
*  I'm like, 2015. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5895.96s)]
*  And he's wrong about that. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5897.96s)]
*  He is so sharp still. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5899.72s)]
*  And in not a I'm grading on a curve because he's like my TV grandpa sort of a way, but [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5901.96s)]
*  merely in the way of I've done a lot of TV at this point and he is still so fucking good [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5906.84s)]
*  at it. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5912.84s)]
*  And see, that's the age difference between us because I was called a monster. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5913.16s)]
*  He's called him Uncle Tony. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5916.52s)]
*  I'm Graham. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5917.8s)]
*  And you call him Grandpa. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5918.52s)]
*  Lolo's where you were a different generation. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5919.56s)]
*  Yeah, he went to my wedding. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5921.88s)]
*  I'm not surprised. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5924.120000000001s)]
*  I invited him and he said, I'm going to leave at nine thirty and he left at nine twenty [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5925.160000000001s)]
*  nine. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5929.8s)]
*  And I'm amazed it wasn't that thirty exactly. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5935.240000000001s)]
*  Well, so I he went around and shook everyone's hand because it was also kind of like he was [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5938.280000000001s)]
*  the guest. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5943.64s)]
*  He was the celebrity guest. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5944.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5945.56s)]
*  And everyone loved it. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5946.12s)]
*  Tony Korniser to be as just what he is in real life is so much anyway, he doesn't want [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5949.48s)]
*  me to say too many things in public about what we talk about personally. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5955.96s)]
*  But my God, he's so fun to talk to. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5960.68s)]
*  And the fact that we share him in common as a person that we adore and will be both confused [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5963.88s)]
*  when we have to recap why we did this show. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5970.76s)]
*  We probably should have done it sooner anyway, because I've had a good time. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5972.92s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5977.0s)]
*  But yeah, the thing with Tony, I think my favorite thing about him is the phone will [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5978.4400000000005s)]
*  just ring. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5983.4s)]
*  You very few people where you just get a call and I'll be like, all right, I know this [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5985.16s)]
*  is going to be thirty minutes, but I'm excited for it. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5989.4800000000005s)]
*  And then he's just there's no hello. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5991.96s)]
*  How are you? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5994.28s)]
*  He's just right into the conversation. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5995.08s)]
*  It's always like, what is going on with dot dot dot? [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=5997.72s)]
*  And then it's just you're just kind of doing a show with them. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6001.24s)]
*  It's the best. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6004.04s)]
*  But that's why like, you know, I actually think PTI is now underrated for [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6005.32s)]
*  people don't understand from a pure metric perspective, the highest rated show in the [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6011.48s)]
*  daytime lineup. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6016.36s)]
*  Still, still we talk about all the other shows a lot. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6017.4s)]
*  Still number one doing doing stories that are like 10, 11 hours old compared to like [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6020.76s)]
*  the advantage get up and first take half. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6027.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6030.12s)]
*  By the time it gets to those guys, the stories like done. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6030.36s)]
*  There's been now in the podcast era, there's a million podcasts that are out every day [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6033.0s)]
*  and people have already reacted and done their thoughts. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6037.4s)]
*  And then those guys come in and there's to me the two of them together. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6040.04s)]
*  It's like an old married couple that still like works 100 percent. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6046.44s)]
*  It's a lot inside the NBA is the same way. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6049.639999999999s)]
*  Like those guys just still work as a group. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6051.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6054.839999999999s)]
*  And that's just the way it is. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6055.16s)]
*  It's chemistry. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6056.36s)]
*  You can't fake it. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6057.32s)]
*  Again, you do know it when you see it in that regard. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6058.44s)]
*  And Eric and Matt, producers of PTI and the staff and Tony and Mike, they take it again, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6060.839999999999s)]
*  they take it seriously, but they don't take themselves in the way that they do the show [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6068.2s)]
*  so seriously. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6072.04s)]
*  And Tony and Mike. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6073.24s)]
*  No, but Tony takes one thing seriously and I can't speak for Mike because I think Mike's [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6074.759999999999s)]
*  Mike's easy going. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6079.48s)]
*  Like he would have gone to an hour and been fine with it. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6080.28s)]
*  Tony is very committed. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6082.839999999999s)]
*  He's committed to the structure. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6084.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6087.08s)]
*  He won't change. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6088.6s)]
*  What's really interesting about that show, they haven't really added anything to the [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6090.44s)]
*  structure. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6094.84s)]
*  It's still done the same way that fourth segment with the birthdays and racing through. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6095.64s)]
*  That's from 2004. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6099.88s)]
*  I don't know how many years it took them to figure it. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6102.28s)]
*  Tony will not touch that and he will get mad if you even suggest it. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6104.68s)]
*  Tony refuses to say the words, pardon the interruption, because he just never liked [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6107.88s)]
*  the name. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6113.4800000000005s)]
*  He always says, welcome to PTI, boys and girls. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6114.36s)]
*  He noticed just like he is. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6116.28s)]
*  I mean, when I say he doesn't take himself seriously, I mean, in the sense of he's willing [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6117.96s)]
*  to be laughed at and will be the class clown and perform. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6121.639999999999s)]
*  And that is a key trait I find in television. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6126.28s)]
*  But he's also so deeply devoted to why PTI has worked. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6129.4s)]
*  And I think it's because he and Mike see this as an extension of their journalistic selves. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6136.04s)]
*  You know, they're not in locker rooms anymore. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6142.44s)]
*  They're not at press. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6144.679999999999s)]
*  Mike still does. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6145.56s)]
*  But they still have the DNA of it. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6146.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, Tony wrote some of the better features of the late 70s and early 80s. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6148.6s)]
*  He has a whole era that nobody even remembers anymore. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6153.080000000001s)]
*  I was talking to somebody who is not a sports fan, but just read randomly. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6155.56s)]
*  They were doing research. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6159.160000000001s)]
*  The Rick Berry one? [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6159.8s)]
*  No, but Rick Berry being an asshole and that being a Sports Illustrated feature is an all-time [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6160.92s)]
*  great story. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6164.4400000000005s)]
*  I thought that was probably the best thing to write. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6165.160000000001s)]
*  What were you going to say? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6166.92s)]
*  So I didn't know about this one, but while in LA this weekend, someone who's a big, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6168.04s)]
*  bring a full circle again, a Star Wars fan was like Tony Kornheiser for the Washington [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6171.88s)]
*  Post for the style section did a piece about the Empire Strikes Back. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6177.16s)]
*  And I'm just like, and this person didn't know that Kornheiser did this and like got [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6183.56s)]
*  this column that was so funny and smart. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6189.88s)]
*  So like from like 1980? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6192.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6194.04s)]
*  And like Tony has been out here doing the shit that we say we're innovating new forms [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6195.0s)]
*  of media and it's culture and sports colliding. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6199.32s)]
*  Tony has been out here doing stuff for whatever year. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6201.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6205.719999999999s)]
*  50 years. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6206.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6208.04s)]
*  He had, I remember the last couple of years at ESPN, he had this whole thing. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6208.2s)]
*  He kept saying like, and I was like, you know, pretty close to him at this point. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6211.799999999999s)]
*  And he would always be like, well, when Tony, when Mike and I turn it over to you in [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6217.0s)]
*  LeBotard and I was, and finally I got mad at him and I was like, you got to stop that. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6221.08s)]
*  I don't want to take over PTI. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6227.16s)]
*  That's your show. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6229.24s)]
*  You guys are going to die with that show. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6230.36s)]
*  Nobody wants to take that show. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6232.04s)]
*  Nobody wants that responsibility. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6233.48s)]
*  It's your show. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6235.639999999999s)]
*  Like, like stop even thinking that. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6236.44s)]
*  That's, that's the thing is that as much as Tony likes to talk about, oh, take over the thing. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6238.5199999999995s)]
*  They're going to die when they don't want to do it anymore. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6245.4s)]
*  I think nobody should take the show over. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6247.72s)]
*  I agree. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6249.72s)]
*  Come up with another idea. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6250.28s)]
*  I also fully think that the show will die when they die. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6251.48s)]
*  They literally had to say, I mean, they're not going to stop doing it. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6255.48s)]
*  Wilbon was doing get up the last couple of weeks. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6259.08s)]
*  Like, Wilbon's motor is available. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6261.16s)]
*  Wilbon's motor is a remarkable thing as a prospect. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6263.24s)]
*  Wilbon. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6267.16s)]
*  I don't think there's been a lot of people at that age who've done it this way. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6268.44s)]
*  I was always, though year I was doing the countdown with Wilbon and Magic. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6272.919999999999s)]
*  Those guys were just machines that could come to life on camera and we could have, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6277.5599999999995s)]
*  we would be like, they would give us like this big meal, you know, they'd give us, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6282.84s)]
*  cause we were taping the show would be like four 30, five o'clock west coast time. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6286.12s)]
*  And then we'd have to be there for the basketball come back in. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6291.24s)]
*  So they'd have food and those guys could eat like entire dinners and go out there [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6293.5599999999995s)]
*  two minutes later and just, just light up. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6298.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6301.4s)]
*  I was like, that's a skill. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6302.36s)]
*  I'm not sure I'll ever have. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6303.88s)]
*  By the way, I'll just have a small salad because I don't want to be in a food coma [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6306.28s)]
*  and seem like I'm luggage on this. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6310.36s)]
*  Yeah. Farting on air is probably not the best. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6312.04s)]
*  Anyway, so I, so you agree with me that show should die with them? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6315.4s)]
*  Look, I, when they don't want to do it, I think that should be it for the show. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6318.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't think there's any following them. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6321.72s)]
*  I don't think that that show could be done without, I think as a film, as a fill in love [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6325.32s)]
*  being a substitute teacher, right? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6332.84s)]
*  Have no illusions that PTI should be mine or whoever else's once those guys leave. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6334.92s)]
*  I wouldn't want that burden. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6342.2s)]
*  Like talk about being set up to fail, you know, just being set up to disappoint people. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6346.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, yeah, I'm not Tony and Mike and I miss them too. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6351.96s)]
*  Would be how I felt every time I would fill in as the hypothetical replacement. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6355.08s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm here. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6361.24s)]
*  Yeah. I also wish they were still here. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6362.44s)]
*  Yeah. It's better when they're in person though, which we were talking about before we started. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6364.92s)]
*  And that was one of the things COVID really fucked up because the zoom made it easier. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6371.0s)]
*  I used to interview everybody. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6374.759999999999s)]
*  We had all these people coming in and then people ask why I don't do the interviews as much anymore, [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6376.28s)]
*  which I think we're going to change because we're building a couple of studios. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6381.08s)]
*  But I just didn't like doing it on zoom. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6383.48s)]
*  It's even like you and I talking today. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6386.839999999999s)]
*  It was like we could have done it on zoom, but as you were here and it was like, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6388.599999999999s)]
*  let's do it in person. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6391.16s)]
*  It would be way better. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6392.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's like we could have a phone call in which both of us immediately start yelling at each other, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6392.839999999999s)]
*  which is what happened. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6397.08s)]
*  But then it led to a conversation that to me, I think clarified that even if Bill Simmons, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6398.36s)]
*  guy I grew up reading, may not be a subscriber to my show, conspiracy bill absolutely is. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6405.32s)]
*  And I'm so glad that conspiracy bill. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6411.08s)]
*  He's aware of... [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gpsUqOeTU&t=6412.84s)]
