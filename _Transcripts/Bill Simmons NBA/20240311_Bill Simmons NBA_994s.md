# NBA Officiating Has Changed … | The Bill Simmons Podcast
**Bill Simmons NBA:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ)
*  We've been talking about the foul situation, the NBA. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You, I think, did multiple opening segments about this new era we were in with the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=3.94s)]
*  NBA with guys diving into people, lurching into people. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  You started getting a ton of feedback. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=12.76s)]
*  I was getting feedback vicariously just because we do podcasts together and I [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=14.76s)]
*  had people reaching out, we were on threads with multiple people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=19.0s)]
*  Um, and then over the all-star break, something crazy happens. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=22.72s)]
*  They actually change how they're officiating the games and we're all watching [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=28.92s)]
*  it and we're going, is this different? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=33.04s)]
*  I went to two Laker games. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=34.88s)]
*  I think I talked about in a previous pod. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=36.14s)]
*  I'm like, man, this is really physical. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=37.56s)]
*  Like I'm, I'm surprised the Lakers nuggets game I went to 17 free throws total. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=40.2s)]
*  Um, just in general, something has shifted. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=46.2s)]
*  Ethan Sherwood Strauss, our friend wrote about it for his, uh, sub stack yesterday [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=48.88s)]
*  too, but, uh, you noticed right away, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=52.72s)]
*  When did you, when were you like, oh my God. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=55.68s)]
*  They're actually changing this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=57.88s)]
*  Just, I would say different freedom of movement plays where, uh, you know, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=60.32s)]
*  like sometimes when you're looking for it, you find it right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  So as soon as I started thinking I was noticing it, then I felt like I was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=67.76s)]
*  noticing even more because I was looking for it, but there's just certain plays [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=71.16s)]
*  that, you know, we can get into which ones you like or don't like in some of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=74.76s)]
*  the numbers that Ethan shared, but. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=77.84s)]
*  Like even, even today with the Clippers, like norm Powell hooks a defensive [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  player's arm now he exaggerated it pretty bad. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  But then he got called for the foul and I was like, wait, okay. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=87.76s)]
*  That's a little different. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=91.56s)]
*  There was a play last night with Durant going up against Jaylen Brown where I [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=92.68s)]
*  couldn't believe Jaylen Brown wasn't called for a foul Durant hits the bucket [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=95.6s)]
*  because he was incredible. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=99.32s)]
*  Can't wait to talk about that second half. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=100.32s)]
*  Durant was getting mauled. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=102.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=104.2s)]
*  And so it was still, and he had 45 points, but it fell under the old [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=104.76s)]
*  rules, I think he would add 60 cause they would have called every single foul. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=108.56s)]
*  So the play, the single play that led me to lose my mind and a couple pods was [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=112.28s)]
*  just the drive where the offensive player is parallel to the paint. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=119.0s)]
*  They're not even veering towards the rim and you're staying parallel with them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=122.8s)]
*  as the defensive player, and then they veer into you at the last second and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=127.0s)]
*  then they kind of haul it up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=129.88s)]
*  I mean, really, you know, Trey Young has done it a million times. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=131.16s)]
*  So it's like if you're on a highway and a car, the car in the middle lane [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=133.32s)]
*  just veers into your lane and then they're doing the police report. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=137.28s)]
*  And it's like, whose fault was it? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=140.92s)]
*  And it was like the guy that left the guy who was just going [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=142.11999999999998s)]
*  straight forward, it's his fault. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  He's a hundred percent to blame. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=147.56s)]
*  Is he? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=149.04s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  You know, I don't know if this is the numbers bear it out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=153.44s)]
*  Like pre all-star game teams are averaging 115.7 points per game. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=155.56s)]
*  Post all-star game. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=160.0s)]
*  It's 111.7 free throws are down from almost 23 attempts to 20 attempts, but [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=160.88s)]
*  pre all-star we're also talking about the offensive ratings are down too. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, we had like a bunch of people that were up that I think now there's still [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=169.92s)]
*  like a top six or seven, but then it's a pretty dramatic drop after that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=173.24s)]
*  But you're also looking at 53 to 55 games, pre all-star, like eight to 11 games, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, depending on the time that this podcast released today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=181.68s)]
*  So yes, I am noticing it, but there are other times where I'm like, man, it just [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=183.84s)]
*  looks like the defenders being more, uh, he's just being allowed to be more [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=188.44s)]
*  physical cutting off the driving path. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=192.8s)]
*  That's the thing I'm noticing more. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=194.88s)]
*  And it doesn't necessarily mean like foul, non foul. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=196.64s)]
*  It's just, oh, wow. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=198.76s)]
*  Like they collided there a little bit and they just let them keep playing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=199.56s)]
*  And by the way, I'm all for it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, there was another thing going on too. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  The sharps picked it up immediately and were bed in the unders and the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=208.0s)]
*  unders were hitting pretty huge before Vegas realized what was going on. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  I think started adjusting, but I have so many anecdotes from just watching [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=215.72s)]
*  basketball in person and then on TV, but the big, the big play that jumps out to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=219.16s)]
*  me the most is the end of that Celtics Cavs game when Tatum, when he had that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=222.84s)]
*  last possession and he dribbled up and Garland arm bars them and elbows them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  And it was all stuff just that nobody was getting away with. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=232.08s)]
*  It was just more physical. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  You think that was a bad overturn? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=236.96s)]
*  No. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  Oh no, not the foul itself. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=239.36s)]
*  I'm talking about the way he was defending him before Tatum even shot the shot. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=240.84s)]
*  What's changed now is when guys are trying to. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=244.44s)]
*  The little player in that matchup physically is going to be allowed to do [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  whatever he wants all the time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=249.72s)]
*  Yeah, fair. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  But I noticed that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=251.72s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, he did, but I noticed that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  I noticed the game I went to the Denver Lakers game, Yocage, um, when he was [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=256.68s)]
*  doing his kind of back down, Whirly, Burley, Whirly, Burley thing, and the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=261.24s)]
*  Lakers were just kind of clubbing them and they were just letting it go. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=265.32s)]
*  I mean, they didn't even get to 10 free throws in that game. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=267.88s)]
*  And then last night, the Sun Celtics, um, it made me start wondering. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=270.12s)]
*  What is this change going to do better or worse for the Celtics? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=275.48s)]
*  Cause defensively, you know, especially holiday and white now can ratchet it up a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=279.32s)]
*  level. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  But on the other end, I thought it was way harder for Tatum and Brown to kind of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=284.6s)]
*  get to their spots and they played really well last night, but I was watching it [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  going, man, if they were calling fouls, like they normally did, I actually think [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=291.72s)]
*  the Celtics would be winning this game by 20. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=295.12s)]
*  It was just a lot of work to get the shots that they wanted. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=297.24s)]
*  And when that gets to the playoffs, the reason I think this is so important is [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  like, who wins, who wins from this, who wins from this change? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=304.24s)]
*  And it's like, guess who wins the fucking heat, the Jason Voorhees of the NBA. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=307.04s)]
*  They're going to take advantage of this the most, and this is going to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=311.88s)]
*  benefit them the best. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=314.8s)]
*  I think the Celtics with the guards, that's going to really help them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=316.44s)]
*  And I think Minnesota would be the other team that if this is going to be more [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=319.12s)]
*  physical, Minnesota is going to be even with or without towns, Minnesota is going [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  to be really hard to score against if Edwards and McDaniels at the top of the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=326.16s)]
*  key are allowed to get a little more handsy with Gobert behind them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a really good call, especially McDaniels because he lives [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=334.72s)]
*  in foul trouble and he's so aggressive. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=337.36s)]
*  Now, I know Minnesota fans aren't thrilled with the way the officiating ended [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=340.16s)]
*  the other night and maybe we'll get to that Cleveland game, but I don't think [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=343.52s)]
*  too many, I don't think too many Minnesota fans were complaining about the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=346.04s)]
*  officiating against the Pacers the night previous to that, the Anthony Edwards [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=348.4s)]
*  welcoming party to the rest of the world. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=351.24s)]
*  But, you know, McDaniels also had two really stupid fouls. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=354.0s)]
*  So the foul on Garland at the end of the shot clock, when he reaches back across [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=358.2s)]
*  into them is just, you just, like the shot clock's back to expire. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  Like you have to be smarter than that in those spots. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=367.16s)]
*  But now if you're, you bring it out, big picture, I started thinking about it [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=368.96s)]
*  too this morning, just going, all right, wait, if this is real, which I still [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=371.44s)]
*  think we need to see more than nine to 10 games of like, okay, everything's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=374.52s)]
*  different now, the league is different. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=377.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  It's, it's two and a half weeks now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=379.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=380.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=382.28s)]
*  I just, I just know that whenever that feels like something becomes a priority, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  the tendency seems to be kind of default back to like what you're comfortable with. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=389.88s)]
*  And I don't know if this happened, like the league's not, I don't think the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  league's going to admit it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=398.2s)]
*  And then I also thought it was kind of funny that once it's happened, then the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  complaint becomes from the teams, some teams, depending on which side of this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=401.96s)]
*  argument they're on of like, wait, you're just going to do this in the middle of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=405.12s)]
*  the season. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=407.44s)]
*  And I read that stuff and I'm like, yeah, fucking right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=407.96s)]
*  Cause it sucked before. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=410.56s)]
*  So what's, what's your solution? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=412.36s)]
*  Hey, this thing that keeps happening, that sucks, that puts defensive players [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=414.24s)]
*  in an helpless situation, they have like literally no options on drives. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=417.96s)]
*  Your idea is just ride it out for the next few months and then maybe we'll get [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=422.0s)]
*  to it this summer. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=425.56s)]
*  We'll change it in July. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=426.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=427.08s)]
*  Like be happy if the league did in fact do this, that the league was like, you [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=427.47999999999996s)]
*  know, Hey, enough of this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  I also wonder like how much of just the all-star weekend, which, you know, I [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=433.12s)]
*  don't, I don't have any time for it's not for me. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=437.12s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=440.56s)]
*  I think complaining about it is probably more pointless because it's almost like [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=441.44s)]
*  people forget it takes 12 months and then they forget how bad it was the year before. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=444.2s)]
*  Like this year was not the first year that this isn't fun to watch, but you know, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  whether it was just this, this point of frustration, I don't know if any of the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=452.56s)]
*  things are combined with it, but you're right. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  Like which teams, which players do you go, wait a minute, this actually now maybe [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=460.12s)]
*  ticks it their way a couple of points in advantage because of how physical they [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  can be, especially, especially with the perimeter stuff, because some of the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=468.32s)]
*  teams, it looked like they felt helpless on the perimeter. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=471.76s)]
*  It was just nothing you could ever do. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=474.68s)]
*  I wonder, I don't think this is a top three reason they did it, but it might be [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  the top five, knowing that the Olympics are coming for the NBA and for a lot of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=480.36s)]
*  the best players in the league that are going to be playing for different [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=485.52s)]
*  countries and how drastically different those games are officiated than what [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=488.04s)]
*  we're watching over here. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=492.84s)]
*  Like, especially if, if the goal of the NBA is like, man, it'd be nice if team [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=494.28s)]
*  USA was able to pull off a gold medal. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=497.92s)]
*  This was not the training ground. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=501.28s)]
*  This NBA season we have for how to play the FIFA rules, which are completely [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=502.76s)]
*  different, different flow. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=506.76s)]
*  Nobody gets a call ever in FIFA. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=508.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=511.2s)]
*  I thought I'd flag that too, but the biggest thing for me is who wins from this. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=512.04s)]
*  Like who else do you think wins? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=518.6s)]
*  Like who else, because I think your McDaniel's point is a perfect one. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=519.84s)]
*  Like that might be the best example. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  I think, I think this hurts Denver a tiny bit because. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=525.52s)]
*  Jokic I felt like was officiated a tiny bit unfairly to begin with is a little [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=530.36s)]
*  bit of shackiness with how the referee is like, well, he's so big. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=535.04s)]
*  What are we supposed to do? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  But he does get mauled all the time. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=538.68s)]
*  I think he gets his ass kicked all the time. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=540.4s)]
*  So seeing a game after this. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=542.04s)]
*  Just let it go. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=543.4s)]
*  So I don't know if that's necessarily any different in the Lakers game than all [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=544.04s)]
*  the other times, like as much as we both love Steve Kerr, I think his frustration [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=547.8399999999999s)]
*  after that Denver game when he had a lot of free throws was about some of the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=551.76s)]
*  stuff, the bigger picture stuff that we're talking about in reality, like [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=554.48s)]
*  Jokic isn't the best person to use as the example, because in comparison to the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=557.64s)]
*  other players, like because he's in the post and because he's working slowly, I [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=562.0s)]
*  think people are allowed to be way more physical with him because it's not out in [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=566.0s)]
*  the open with the ball heading towards the basket. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  I think it's bad for the Knicks. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=572.2s)]
*  Cause especially the Brunson centric when he comes back, but the Brunson [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=574.52s)]
*  centric offense they had tough one. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=578.48s)]
*  The, especially if you're allowed to be really physical against that, I [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=581.52s)]
*  think that could hurt them. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=584.6s)]
*  Uh, Saruti's magic. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=586.12s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  We'll see, you know, not that they're going to be a four seed. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=588.2s)]
*  Now they're home court in round one, probably. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=591.28s)]
*  Um, now it's, we'll see how it plays out, but it's definitely, uh, you know, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=594.44s)]
*  I was even watching Durant last night. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=598.88s)]
*  Who's having an incredible offensive year. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=601.52s)]
*  I mean, his numbers, I want to talk about that later, but his numbers at age 35 [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  compared to the other seasons in his career, like the percentages are actually [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=608.32s)]
*  higher now, does that have to do with how they're calling the games, the free [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=611.8000000000001s)]
*  flow and play all that stuff? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=614.84s)]
*  As he figured out a way Brady's style to actually get better. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=616.68s)]
*  It was his mid thirties, I don't fully understand it, but you know, he's. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=620.0s)]
*  Like a 53, 45, 86 guy percentage wise, this is the best [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=624.64s)]
*  percentages he's ever had. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=629.8s)]
*  Even yesterday, there was a point in the Celtic game and the Celtics [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  played well last night. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=635.2399999999999s)]
*  Like that was about as, as without poor Zingas, that's about as well [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  as they could play and Durant was like 15 for 20 at one point. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  Do you see that? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=644.56s)]
*  Well, yeah, because it just, every time you're like, all right, Boston's got this, Boston's got this. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=645.08s)]
*  Something will happen. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=649.64s)]
*  No, they don't. And look, I was curious to see how they would look after the Cleveland loss. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think we should probably talk about the Denver loss at some point or the Denver win. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=656.12s)]
*  I want to do that next. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=659.72s)]
*  Yeah. All right. But staying on this though, with the scoring part of it, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=661.1600000000001s)]
*  like in what motivated this stuff, whether it was complaints from teams or, you know, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=665.72s)]
*  just watching enough in the first half of the season where you went, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=670.5200000000001s)]
*  wait, is this, is this what it is now for offensive players? And you had the Embiid game, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=673.88s)]
*  you had the Towns game, you had the Booker game in there. And Booker's always good for like one [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=680.3599999999999s)]
*  crazy one. The funniest thing I think is like how the Luka one became negative. And I know [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=685.56s)]
*  Mavs fans turned it into somehow that this massive campaign to be against Luka. When I, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=690.76s)]
*  I think it's as simple, it was just, he was the guy that scored his points after the other guys did. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=696.04s)]
*  And then it became not so much how great is Luka, but like, what the hell is going on in this sport? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=702.04s)]
*  Because I would tell you that I thought Luka's game is the most impressive out of all of those [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=708.52s)]
*  games because he could have shot even more if he wanted to against Atlanta, but he was actually [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=713.16s)]
*  making the right reads because they still had to win that game. You know, as bad as Atlanta's [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=717.48s)]
*  defensively, like I don't know what Pop was trying to do to win Benyama in that Embiid game. Like, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=721.16s)]
*  yeah, just we're just never going to bring a double and we're just going to see like, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=725.88s)]
*  we're going to leave. Yeah. I think Pop had a dinner reservation like 10 minutes after the game [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=730.6s)]
*  that he was trying to get to. He just let like, that's what was so scary about it. Embiid's that [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=735.72s)]
*  it was so easy. When I looked at Luka, I went, he still has to make the right basketball play [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=739.96s)]
*  with the way this game is playing out. But because Lucas was after those guys, then I just know, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=747.96s)]
*  I think you know it as well, how it works when you're at ESPN and it's okay, what's the topic [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=753.32s)]
*  today for the shows? The topic pivoted from, oh my God, Embiid had 70, like how great is he to, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=757.96s)]
*  this is the fourth guy to do this in a very short amount of time. Like what the hell's going on? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=764.2800000000001s)]
*  And you know, a lot of, a lot, look, we've said for a couple of years. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=769.32s)]
*  The 50s were as bad. It was just 50 used to really mean something when somebody had 50. Like, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=774.6800000000001s)]
*  oh my God, that guy had 50? 50, I know. And then 50 is just, I feel like, what, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=779.88s)]
*  how many guys in the league would you not be surprised by a 50 point game from? At least 30? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=784.28s)]
*  Yeah, depending on the circumstance, you know, who else was hurt or whatever, because [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=790.68s)]
*  like, Jaylen Brown can have a 50 point game at this point. It never would have been a million [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=795.16s)]
*  years thought he was going to score 50 points in a game, but it's probably going to happen. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=798.92s)]
*  Or maybe not now that we have these new rules. Should we try to come up with how many guys you'd [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=803.64s)]
*  say no to 50 Bones Highland? Could Bones Highland get 50? Maybe the right situation. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=807.4s)]
*  Playing for a lottery team? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=814.28s)]
*  Mere coffee. I have clippers. I got clippers on the mind after that game today. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=816.6s)]
*  So every team has two guys who could probably have gotten 50 under these old rules. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=820.52s)]
*  Do you want to pivot to Boston Denver? Did we hit this enough? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=826.6s)]
*  We have to talk about it. I want to, well, do you have more on this or do you want to go to [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=830.04s)]
*  Boston Denver? The only thing I would say on this, and then we can move to Boston Denver is [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=833.9599999999999s)]
*  the amount of private discourse about what was going on with the rules and how mad people on the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=840.12s)]
*  different teams were versus what was being discussed publicly. I thought there was a pretty [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=845.88s)]
*  big disparity. I really feel like the feeling I got, and I think you got, you felt the same, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=850.6s)]
*  especially after you started really talking about it and people reached out to you, is that people [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=855.96s)]
*  in the league felt like this was a crisis. Like this was like, if we don't fix this, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=861.32s)]
*  this might not, we might not be able to pull this back. Like this might become what basketball is. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=866.84s)]
*  And I think people were just like, this sucks. It's a bad product. It's hard to coach. It's [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=872.92s)]
*  making guys who are mediocre players look good and it's making good players look great. And this [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=878.52s)]
*  is bullshit and we have to fix this. So I don't know if Adam went to all-star weekend and was [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=883.8s)]
*  talking to a bunch of people about it or what happens. Yeah. So as Joe Dumars is really important [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=889.08s)]
*  behind the scenes now, and I think, you know, a little like how Theo Epstein was tasked with, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=893.24s)]
*  Hey, can you, can you help us fix baseball? Do you have any ideas? And then he really put time and [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=898.36s)]
*  thought and energy into it and studied and came up with changes. I think Dumars has been involved [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=902.92s)]
*  behind the scenes. I wouldn't be surprised by that. And, you know, I know that there's always [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=907.4s)]
*  like a reminder of, of when you think people like you, like how often I would take calls from teams [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=913.64s)]
*  to bitch about other media members. I know you and I've talked about this. So I've never been [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=919.8s)]
*  delusional enough to think that I haven't been the subject of somebody calling another media member [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=926.8399999999999s)]
*  to be like, that Rassula guy sucks. Right. But having, having said that with the understanding, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=931.56s)]
*  knowing that it likely, likely almost certainly exists, I didn't get one [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=937.0s)]
*  team to reach out to me to tell me I was wrong. After I did my- [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=943.16s)]
*  Yeah. Nobody's like, you're crazy. This is great. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  And there are people that I think I'm close enough with it and I'm like, Hey, I think you're off base [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=949.0s)]
*  on this or you're nuts or here's what you should look at. It was across the board. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=952.4399999999999s)]
*  Keep talking about this. Yeah, totally. That's what made it so interesting. It was like, please, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=957.88s)]
*  maybe you'll make a difference. Be picketing outside Silver's office. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=964.04s)]
*  Year 2029, just me at the center court, heroes among us. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=970.92s)]
*  Rassula, his monologue on a January 15th podcast was the catalyst. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5yEfxvoHqQ&t=974.52s)]
